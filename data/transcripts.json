Well, let me get started on the painting so I can and I'll paint it and talk at the same time. But yeah, it's a good question. I'm going to put. I have a timer that I'm testing. This is a new plugin that hopefully will be available soon for anybody that's interested. My boyfriend does web development and he has been working on this plugin for photo shop, so I use stuff like this all the time. So hopefully it's going to work well. I'm trying to find bugs and stuff in it, so an hour and 30 minutes is what I'm going to try to spend on this. This portrait will see if we need more time, but I think that's a good start, alright? I am going to start with a sketch because I find it helpful to begin with a sketch. But the whole impostor syndrome thing. So if anybody doesn't know what she was talking about for my understanding impostor syndrome is this that idea that you, no matter how good you get it something sometimes? Or how like how well known you might get if you are, let's say you start having a following for your art or something like that. You still have these feelings inside that like you're not good enough or or other people might think you're good, but somehow it's going to come out that you're not good and it's just like an illusion or something. It's kind of that feeling. And I think. I've definitely had this discussion with a lot of other artists, seen a lot of other artists talk about their feelings about this. And. It's something that is not related to your actual quality of work. It's kind of like a mindset thing. That's like a fear that people can have. And it's not just in the art industry, but you know in any industry you could feel that way. You could feel like you know you're just not there not. I don't know how to say it, but it's definitely something that can be put my reference on the other monitor 2. I think it has more to do with your mindset than your actual quality of work is. What I'm trying to get at. Hey red, it's good to see you and you too. Michael, welcome everybody. We're talking about Steven asked a question about impostor syndrome. How do you know if you have impostor syndrome or you just are into that good? I guess I just don't think that it's a. What's the word? I don't think it's like a useful question because it doesn't matter if you are. If it's true that you aren't that good, being that good is very. Um? What's the word when something is only exist in relationship to its relative? I'm not that good if you compare me to like not, you know, some master artists that I look up to. But you know someone who's just starting out might think that I'm amazing an I'm happy with where I am compared to my past, but I still have places I want to get too. So who's to say if I'm good or not good? It's all relative and it's not really useful to think about it that way, because if you are, if it's true that you're not that good or if you're anywhere along in the process, there's always room for improvement. So even if it turns out that you, let's say, let's say you have a long way to go and you're just starting out and it's true that your skills are not at a high level, acknowledging that it doesn't really matter, you just need to keep going kind of thing. Um even says, obviously, that question doesn't apply to people working as artist. They have a feedback loop in the people are spending money with them, but I disagree because I know professional artists that still feel that way. I think it has a lot more to do with how you feel than any reality of the situation. That's my point. Like I really don't think that. I think that impostor syndrome has more to do with how you feel than. Anything else? So that's just my my opinion since you asked. I, that's yeah, I don't know what else to say about it. I feel like you just got to keep working. If you feel like so. I've heard this phrase before and I agree with it. Competence brings confidence, so the more that you work on your skills and improve them, you can form confidence from that you know. If you feel like you are somehow a fraud because you don't. I don't know have solid foundations to your skills. Then just work on those things. Don't make it a doesn't have to be a negative thing. Just keep working. I think having high expectations feeling like you need to appear perfect. All that stuff is where the impostor syndrome kind of comes from. Read says my boyfriend is a developer and he had this thing mindset each time that he gets stuck or something like he's not worth paying and not going to going to get fired. And I'm like struggling struggling happens. Just try exactly exactly. You know what I'm having trouble. Visualizing this as a sketch, I think what I'm going to do is just start painting and blocking in shapes rather than sketching out the whole face. I'm like not really feeling this workflow, so let's try that instead. Let's do a little workflow shift. You know what I'm saying, Stewart? So it's not about question. That's just my feelings on it. But if you are feeling that way, you know you really not alone. A lot of people out of artists go through having that sort of feeling impostor syndrome. I'm excited, hey, let's Alpha welcome. Alright so I'm gonna start, let's start with let's just start with a dark background I should have just dropped a paint bucket in here but. Will do it the old fashioned way. Alright, I'm going to start with a dark background because we're working digital. We can do this. I've been doing a lot of photos. I've been doing a lot of watercolor painting lately and I can't really do this and with watercolor, but it's nice with digital. We can work this way, so I'm using my soft shading and blending brush and we're going to like come out of the shadows here. So even says, why do you draw with drafts? Not with a pen. Accuracy will be better. I use I do very very my sketches never get How do I say this? I don't make line art. I do like a rough sketch 'cause it's it's real quick and then often I go into the painting phase really, really fast. This is faster than usual. Usually I have sketched out a little bit more, but I just wasn't feeling it. But whenever I do a sketch, it's never going to remain in the final like some people have lines in their final work as part of the art style. I never do so for me. It's kind of a waste of time to make this sketch really detailed. Most of when I like to figure things out is in the painting process when I'm working with shapes, I find that this is a preferred workflow. If I was ever going to have the line art. In the finished one. Then I probably spend a little bit more time on it. So right now I'm working on. Blocking in shapes, it's going to be a bit messy at the beginning, but hang tight yesterday. I did some portrait practice. During a friends live stream and like painted along, it was really really fun. So I'm kind of like excited to work on this and definitely move for it, but just be aware the early stages are often a bit bumpy. That's just how it is. You gotta, you gotta build up from something. For those of you who aren't familiar with my portrait work, I can show you the painting that I did yesterday. This was about 45 minutes, or an hour's worth of painting. Honestly, this one went better than I was expecting, but this is the kind of style I'm going for right now, so that's what hopefully will get something like this. But it starts like this. It starts rough, an gets more and more fleshed out, more more narrowed down and detailed. And Yeah, but you gotta start somewhere. So I'm focusing on the. Where the lighting is coming from, we got one side of her face pretty heavily lit and trying to look at the planes of the face and the big shape, so I'm kind of going to like Sculpteur from the shadows. I like to flip the reference a lot and my painting a lot as I work. Is it helps me notice that things are wonky. This one is a bit hard because of how dark it is. Oh, thank you Jane. Thank you. If you guys are interested in painting along, you could find the references below the stream in the description. There's a link all of my reference images are from Pexels Unsplash Pixabay, plus the places like that, so you're free to use. Some photographers have uploaded them there for people to use, which is really generous and I use those sites a lot for art references. Oftentimes, portraits like really creepy at the beginning, so I apologize. I'll try to get the eyes in there as soon as possible so it makes it a little less creepy, but you can see I'm kind of focusing more on the face structure and like making a place for the eyes to sit in. And then we'll be adding the eyes into there. Jane says anything it kind of good art. Need solid foundation, traditional Art Foundation. Well, I started as a traditional artist because. Well, I was young and that was the most accessible thing. I do agree that you have to have a solid foundation, but I don't know if you have. I don't think feel very strongly that you have to start with traditional art necessarily. I do think you need to start with foundations or at least spend some time on foundation. Things like basics of composition, color theory. Proportions values, that's probably the most important things. The relationships of dark, dark to lights in your images, stuff like that. I don't know that you have to do it on a traditional medium. I think you can do it digitally. I think those things transition. Thank you, Stuart. Thank you. They did I did get invited to stream here, which I was really very happy. Very happy to be invited. Someone messaged me houssami streaming on Twitch. I also stream on Twitch. Nowadays I do more traditional work there. Um? But yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Kate cable. Thank you very much. So I'm right now, the things I'm trying to pay attention to, our proportions of the face and also the edges, like trying to look at the silhouette. Well, it's not much of a silhouettes. Pretty dark over here, but I'm trying to look at the line at outside of her face. So for example, different people have different proportions. Sometimes the you'll have a really a cheek bone that protrudes out more. Sometimes people will have a square jaw for each person. You can have these different features so I'm trying to pay attention. To that Hey Jackson. That's so funny welcome. Oh my gosh, that's great. Well I'm glad you managed to find your way here. Even without the notifications. And thank you for thank you for the follow again. It's funny. Alright, I've gotta move her up on the page a little bit and let's just block in her shirt. Kind of roughly here. That's not the right color. So I probably won't go too much in detail with like the patterning on her share will just will just throw it a color in here. If we have time, we might do a little bit more, but that's not the most important thing I'm probably going to kind of. She's going to like dissolve into the shadows around her. Welcome everybody, I'm sorry I can only read I can only read in English unfortunately so. I apologize, I cannot answer everyone's questions. You could try using like a Google translator or something like that. And then I'd be happy to. Happy to try and answer if you have any questions. OK, let's actually paint in some facial features now. I'm going to. I'm using a brush that really doesn't allow me to be very detailed at all. Highly ards good to see you. We are we're doing portraits today. So you guys can see this brush. It's pretty, it's pretty soft and it doesn't get too. There's only so much detail you can really do with it, but it's great because it kind of prevents me from getting too detailed too soon and give some nice painterly look. You can download this brush for free below the stream in the description there's a link to a free brush pack and this one is in there. It's called a soft shading and blending brush. OK, so let's get her eyes and. At least in a basic. Gotta start somewhere and then we can adjust. So. We can add the whites of the eyes are going to be pretty dark still is this is an overall pretty dark scene. I hope you guys are having a good day so far. Mine was a little hectic this morning, but it's nice to chill now and paint with you. Oh Man, I look. I love painting portraits. Looking like your painting a demon for the 1st 20 minutes or so. I guess we can put the I in. Um Stuart says the quick I drop you use between brush mark how are you getting the color as the primary? I use the shortcut but it appears on the secondary color is that your custom shortcut? OK, So what I'm doing? I hope I'm going to answer your question. Basically, when you have the paint brush selected, if you hold alt at any point it'll bring up the color Picker an I think what it's doing is it's showing you your current colour on the bottom and then as you hover over whatever the. Colors is that you're hovering over. That will be the top. Color that it shows and then if you release then it's just going to take that new color. So yeah, I just hold Alt. I bring up all real quick. That way I can color pic quickly and then keep painting. So I do color pic from my own painting a lot. I will go to the color wheel, select a new colour, but whenever I'm just doing shading and blending within one area, I'll just kind of color pic around. In that area for awhile. You're working on to. That sounds good we are. I hope it's going well. I find the whenever I have a portrait that's at this kind of angle, the angle that's away. So like this angle here, I always find that to be like the hardest side of the face to paint for some reason. But I like to have the mindset when I'm doing a portrait, even though it's digital. I like the kind of the mindset as if I'm dropping actual paints on the canvas and then going back and like moving it around and stuff like that. It makes it gives me the mindset that I'm a little bit more relaxed about where I put Marks and stuff 'cause I don't put down a mark thinking it needs to be perfect. I kind of put down a Mark, Thinking, Alright, there's a little bit of this kind of shadow over here. There's a little bit of this kind of color over there. And just kind of start putting things where it close to where they need to be and then going back and refining it rather than needing to make everything perfect with that one brush stroke that you put down. So I try to take that affect that I'm sculpting a little bit more than painting, but of course it is painting. This is a little highlight up here. So that color was a new color. I'd go to the. Had to go to the color wheel and take that out. Alright, let's let's start addressing the nose and mouth. Got highly on the. Chick chick boom. Little shadow here coming from the nose. And we're going to get a new color for the lips. I don't think I have anything like that yet. So OK, so I'm trying to figure out where to put the lip. If I look at the I it comes roughly down under the. The iris and pupil. That's like where the edge of the Live is. So we can come down like that. I think maybe I made her chain like this too. Small, we need to elongate a little bit 'cause her lip doesn't have a lot of room. But again, let's just kind of even if it just looks like a blob. Let's just block in something where the mouth is going to be, and then we can go back and make it look more like her specific mouth shape. But let's just like kind of start with something. Jackson says if that happens, it will mean you have your secondary color selected, so the colour pick will work for that one. You can switch it with little colors icon on the left panels or repressing X Jackson. Thank you. It sounds like I made him may be misunderstood Stewart's question. I appreciate you answering it. Thank you. Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the nostrils where those are going to be. I think it's time to bring some more highlights into that will help. Like for example I don't know what it's called, but like this area right above the in between the lip and chin there's kind of a highlight that comes down there too. This allowed bird outside. Alright, so I'm working on the shape of the like John channel little bit so now I can that I have everything blocked in on the Phase I can actually look at it and start to say OK. What needs work what? What looks nothing like her what I'm talking about. Proportions and location of features. Now that we at least have a whole human there and we can start making changes 'cause there's a lot that needs to be done. So. See up here her. The hair comes a lot closer to the eyebrow, so I'll bring more her over. I want to figure out what the. Where is the brightest highlights one of the brightest highlights in this whole scene is on the nose here. And her nose is very straight. So I gotta work on that too. And I think the. Lips probably the area that needs the most work to look like her, but will get there. I like flipping like the. The canvas a lot to help me notice things, so I apologize if it's. I hope it's not annoying to watch when I do that, but. Just so you know, whenever I flip the canvas like this, I am also flipping it on my other monitor so I know that the little mini references on the screen isn't flipped, but I am. I am flipping the reference on my other monitor when I flipped, so I'm not trying to like just translate it. That would be that would be really difficult. OK Jackson, well thank you. Either way, that's good info to have, I think. OK, so something that I like to do alot when I'm painting portraits is use a multiply layer. So I'm going to make a new layer, put it on, multiply modan, just paint over some areas that needed a little extra shading. And I think I multiply is really great because it it can add extra shadows but doesn't completely cover an paint over what's already there, so it doesn't destroy your work that you've done. It just kind of adds to it. Also, like to use the smudge brush to get rid of hard edges that don't really. Don't really belong. How much work on the lips? I didn't think about it before choosing this reference, but it's a little bit difficult to work on because. It's so dark and I don't know if you can tell, but the room that I'm in is like a very. Is very bright and is a bit of glare. My monitor, so it's kind of difficult to see what I'm doing. Should have thought of that first. I don't know if any of you guys have those problems when you're doing digital art stuff, but I need to get some more intense curtains in this room. There bit sheer don't do much. Alright, let's work on the nose. So under the nose we want to look a little bit more three-dimensional. Shadow down there. There's a very interesting shape to the chin too. There we go. We're getting a little closer. I have a tendency to make my characters like have a little smile or smirk when they actually don't. Let's go to the curves and just brighten things up a little bit. That will make it easier for me to see. Now usually I kind of late and as I go, but will just go ahead and bring things up right now. So they do another layer going over the areas that do need to be darker and sharper like I've. We will go back right here and give one more pass over the. Basically the Highline. The eyeliner we have a little bit of like a lost edge kind of thing happening over here. The shadow is kind of. Go from her eye into the hair and you get like. Kind of dissolves over there. Stuart says I'm trying to workout why I use the brush and the alt I drop its place in the color on to the secondary Patch 50s X to switch is not quick as I won't primary. That's so weird. So when you when your color picking, it's not changing it, changing your secondary color instead of your primary color. I wonder if there's any settings down here. That are affecting that. That sounds like there's a whole extra step in there for you and I would. I wouldn't like that either. It's going to make things take a bit longer than needed. I don't know. I've never heard of that. Feel like there might be something that's just checked in the settings. So our. Up Lovely model here has. Green eyes kind of Green, Hazel eyes. I want to pay attention to. The shape of the island too. I'm going to switch to A. Slightly harder brush or like the next level, harder from this brush pistol. Same kind of style brush. Alright, since we've right and stuff up, I think we lost a little bit of the depth. I'm going to make a new layer, put an overlay. And I'm going to go back in and warm up some of its skin color, like for example on the. On the cheek here. Just going by the reference, give a little bit more of a warm colored there. I'm going to take this much brush an I find this really satisfying to you. I hope you guys can see well what I'm doing, but just taking this much brush and blurring some of the edges. An leaving some of them harder, so for portraits it's really nice to have some last edges. I think it just gives more of a romantic kind of feeling to the portrait and more of a classical kind of feeling rather than having everything very hard. Of course it depends on what style you're going for. You might want stylize hard edges, but if I'm going for more of a classical feeling. So I'm paying attention everywhere that the lights. Hitting or trying to find good places for people with highlights and things. Jackson might be on to something. Usually we can somehow crowd source the answer when there's a bunch of us here. I don't know if anybody decided to tackle this portrait with me, but if anyone's painting along, I hope it's going well. I'm finding this one to be a little tough, but portraits are just the challenge in general. I find it like the first level of challenge in portraits is trying to paint something that has correct, you know, correct human proportions? And then like the second level, is trying to make it look like a specific person. And. He had still something that. Likenesses, especially something that I still can have a challenge with, but it's a fun challenge. It always feels like a sort of a breakthrough when you figure out, like the little bit of change. Oh, I need to move the lip over or whatever it is. Getting like this is definitely an interesting puzzle. So her lip, for example, the top lip is much like wider in the center, right under the nose, and then gets a little bit smaller around the. Edges. Ability. How cool Jackson. Thank you. I'm going to open this myself too. Ah, so. You have to. Color window color. I depends which one you have in frontier or something. Yeah, look at that. So you have to select. The foreground or background color here. Wow, Jackson. I thought I would have taken me forever to figure that one out. Thank you. That is a good public service announcement 'cause I would probably one day have the same thing happened to me. Alright, so her nose. I'm starting to get the shape on the left side. I don't know if I've made her nose too wide. Those that I'm saying this coming for ages. Oh my gosh, I'm so glad you asked and Jackson was able to figure it out. 'cause I haven't had that one happen to me, but I've had like little glitchy things like that happen. Now that particular issue. Everyday is learning day is so sure. One of the great things in Photoshop is that there's, like so many little things that you can select and change to make your workflow more personalized. That also can create little puzzles and problems like that because you know, I didn't know that that's something you could even do I didn't know you could select if you wanted the foreground or background to be the what the color pickers liking it. I'm not sure exactly what I would use that for, but. That's cool, that's an option. Alright, let's turn our painting into black and white and do the same thing with our reference. So when I do that, I notice a lot, so I would definitely suggest doing this if you feel stuck. First of all, it's making me realize that my lighting needs to get a lot more extreme. Right now it's pretty flat looking in the in the photo, you see, there's really really bright lights. In some areas, the little highlights on her skin, but other than that, even the left side of her face is like much brighter than the right and it just needs more contrast. So let's. Work on that now. Leart says here's my progress on this one. Going to take a break, let's see. Oh wow, this is so this is one of the other. These portraits. All these references are part of the current art club topic in my discord server were studying stuttering. Oh my gosh, I'm stuttering studying portraits and this is one of the other references. So even though this isn't one that I'm going to be working on today, this is another one that's part of Art Club. An yeah we are. You did a great job with this like the phase is just. Gosh, it looks exactly like her. It looks exactly like her. That's amazing, I'll post the discord link in the chat real quick. There's also when you can find in the stream description below so. If you want you guys can join in there. And join with our studies and things you can share what you do in the discord. We're going to have a little art show an. Go over all the artworks that were that were submitted in there. So I've wanted to spend an hour and a half on this portrait and were half an hour in and I feel like we have a fairly decent foundation for where we are. We have an hour more to make this look nice and hopefully make it look more like her, so I think that's a good place to be. So let's go. I picked a little bit of a different color for the background in my painting than what it actually is. It's really almost black, I think. So I haven't been coloring picking from the actual. Image. But sometimes it's nice to actually go ahead and do that and see where you are. And if you're like on the right and the right color scheme, if you are trying to match it, you can always do your own thing. So I think her like Berry colored shirt. Pretty comes a little bit closer. Been than what I had. I was showing Shauna little more skin. Alright, so I'm going to work on the area around the eyes a little bit more now. One thing that I noticed in the past was I wouldn't pay a lot of attention to eyelids. I was very interested in painting the actual eyes and the eye liner or make up if there was any. You know that kind of thing but. It's really important to pay attention to the whole area around. I the whole anatomy of the eye lid, and especially if you're trying to get a likeness. If you wanted to feel very 3 dimensional, you need to give a place for the eye to exist in. So I think I will move her eyebrows up a little bit. There's plenty of space here for her eyelid and. There's a little bit of highlight catching the edge. The eyelid over here. I'm telling you that the far side of the face is always my my struggle. Let's give a little more color to the list too. She's got a little bit of lipstick on it, looks like. So I think the corner of her mouth comes down a little bit more than what I've done, so let's try to redo it. I think it's just the natural. Resting. Relax, face that she has and I shouldn't look angry or anything. But her face, her ellipse to kind of do have like a downward tilt towards the edge. So after be careful I don't make her look angry. But I do think we're getting closer a little closer like this wise. I like to pay attention to where there's areas of bounce light and things like on the other side of her face. There's a little bit of light in the corner here and then this area down here, little darker. When I first got into painting portraits, my favorite thing to work on was the eyes, and I would always work on that first, and I would end up making my eyes almost finished before working on other things. Anne, I at one point I kind of made a challenge for myself to try to save the eyes for last because I felt like I was think lifting the rest of the portrait too much. I think sometimes I still. I still do that now I'd like to focus on the rest of the face instead of the eyes. I don't think it really. I don't have a strong opinion on if. That you need to do 1 first I think it's kind of for me. I like to just move around the portrait so I don't have any one area getting finished before the rest. Selena says I don't like when people have hair on the photo that blends into it background. That's a really good point. I think unfortunately one of the other pictures for today blends in a little bit too. The one we're doing right after this has a nice contrast of the background. I do prefer that as well. I think it's harder to paint something like this, but. It was a really. I think it's still beautiful photo before painting. It doesn't make it easy. That part. Yeah, I think this layer. Improve the likeness of it. I'm going to work with the airbrush. I do this a lot with painting portraits. I think the airbrush can be really really helpful, especially if you're painting like a young character like this at a young person. That has some skin. You don't need to be afraid of using airbrush a little bit so I can use it to add color or soft shadow or something. Sometimes I'll use the lasso tool to block off an area. So for example, if you do, what kind of hard edge here? And then you can use the airbrush to pop in that shadow. If you do end up with a hard edge, you can use the smudge brush to brush that away. If you can get too much. Hi happy, thank you. Hi IRA, loving the shapes. The phone already really emphasizes the planes of the face. Thank you, thank you. That's very kind of you. I've been trying to pay more attention to that and I feel like the I feel like hard edge brushes are really helpful. Of course I'm using airbrush right now 'cause I'm. Doing some some little shading things, but I've been really trying to. Use some harder edge brushes in my portrait painting is it forces me to make better decisions about those things. Don't like drawing eyes 'cause I can't make it symmetric. That's really hard, isn't it? Well, if you're drawing if you're using if the porch, it's like straight on like this. I guess you could use the symmetry tool in Photoshop to make it perfect, but yeah, from the side these kinds of angles I do find it really tough to do that. I on the far side of the face, this one and this one is tricky. But you know? We just gotta keep practicing. I'm going to switch my airbrush, my everything to an airbrush to. So down here, for example, I'm going to make a selection. Of the nose of the area outside the nose and then I can use the Airbrush. The kind of soften and blend that area. I can also select the inverse if I want to work on the nose. Should try harder brushes too. Yeah, it's nice because you can always go back in with the airbrush or a smudge brush and soften things a little bit, but in the early stages if you use a brush with little bit harder edge it helps you to make more. You know strong shapes. So she is wearing it just this year with an earring. Gold earring looks like and I like the shininess. The texture of that compared with the hair and the skin it's. Nice effect I think so. Let's paint that in. Always blur the faces. I think that's a very very common feeling. I used to have very airbrushed looking faces. But you know, it's not always bad. It kind of depends on what style you're going for. But I do think some hard edges are needed for successful successful image. Some hard edges are needed. Even if you have a soft. Don't like drawn portraits anyways? Hey, that's OK. Hey Mohammed. Ah well, thanks for coming over here. I'll be doing some traditional painting on Twitch tomorrow. So I've been looking forward to doing these portraits. So I wanted to make it look like she's looking at us. Sometimes that's a tricky thing. So in the reference, you'll notice that the. Foster get to see you good morning. And thank you, I really like this reference image. The lighting turned out to be a little tricky. But I guess that's also what makes it nice. Salinas is a usually start drawing faces from full moons. Drawing it is easy to give form with the lights and shadows and want to draw other parts of the face. The nose says like a quality check. That's so funny. Well I know for a lot of people noses like the least favorite part of the phase do paint. So I think that's cool tackling that one first getting it out of the way. No, you do you know at that point you know that parts good and. Yeah, that's cool. What kind of the opposite of what I was doing with saving the eyes for, you know, saving my favorite part for last. Doing the least favorite part first and getting another way. Alright, I want to have this. The cheek a little bit more defined here. So I keep merging the layers down as soon as I paint some area for awhile and I feel like I like the progress. I'll just merge it down. So I don't really have a bunch of layers, I just have this one layer and then whenever I want to do more, just make a new one. Work there for awhile and then merge down. I could paint right on the layer, but I like the sort of security of being able to turn it on and off and say like. I like where this is going sometimes, you know. You work on something for a while and then realize that kinda like the previous version, which is a little sad, but it can happen. So then you can turn back. Alright, this shame needs a little bit of work. I think if likeness wise her chin is really matching up. That part is good. Make everything else look as good as that. I'm very close to the way to think about it. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to capture is that little? Indentation. Model, but it's there. One thing that's a little strange to me is like in my painting, I feel like I made it look like she's hunched over a little bit more than she is in the original, and I think that has to do with. The the angle of her neck and everything. So I'm going to work on that a bit. Now try to make it look like shoes. Yeah, work on her positioning little bit. Maybe that helps a little bit. I'm trying to. Pay attention to where there is slightly different hues to the skin. I feel like under the chin there's a little bit more like a yellow or even. Towards the green here to the skin tone. Whereas up by the cheeks it's like more pink. For example, there's like these slight little differences. And is taking me along. It's taken me awhile to start noticing them and just. I think part of it is just making the habit of really like looking and asking yourself 'cause I used to kind of just choose one sort of, you know, color that represented the skin tone, like in her case I'd choose like Peachy color and then when I was doing the shading I would make everything just like a darker or lighter version of that. But there really are a lot of different hues. And it will be more interesting and lively skin if you pay attention to those things. Love to work with the Navigator in Photoshop makes it easy not to zoom out. That's a good tip. I actually have my navigator window open right now, just on my other monitor. It really helps. I still I still zoom out sometimes, but. I usually I do like to keep this window open. I have it next to the chat on my other matter monitor. Some people, instead of having the Navigator window open, they prefer to open the same like a second version of the document. I kind of just go with the Navigator window soon enough for me. I totally agree. I'm going to turn into black and white and look at it one more time. They've done something a little off with her eyebrow shape here. Sometimes turning things into black-and-white also just gives you a fresh look at it and not just with things to do with values. But sometimes you know you start noticing shapes and things 'cause it just looks different. Things are. We can suddenly notice things differently. So I use the shortcut to turn everything into black and white. If you uhm. If you want to set it up for yourself, I can show you how to do it. It's kind of like a one time thing, and then once you have it set up, it's really easy to use. So you're in your in your windows, you just want to go to view in in your dropdown menu view proof setup. Custom. And then set your device to simulate to working great gain 20%. You can see how it is right here. Just press OK. And then every time you press CTRL Y after that, it'll turn your painting the black-and-white it'll turn here at campus into black and white, and then you can still paint while it's in that format. An it will color. Pick the true color, even though it's only showing you the grayscale version and it's really nice. You can't trust all grayscale like you can't just go in and desaturate your painting. It will not present the values correctly, but if you do it this way then that should work for you. Which they had navigator for illustrator. All they don't. That's interesting. I didn't know that I don't really use illustrator. Because I I don't work in vector usually do all raster painting. But that's curious. I wonder if they'll add it in the future. It seems like it could be useful there as well. I want to work on the shadows over on the far side of the portrait. Even though it seems like she kind of like dissolves into the shadows, it's not quite that simple. There's still areas that are dark and more darker, more contrast. Um? And then some literary's highlights in the hairs go a little brighter. Skin tones are difficult to capture correctly, at least for me. Your colors look great. Thank you foster. Yeah, skin tone. Skin colors are. Are tricky. There's some. There's an artist that I've been getting a lot of inspiration from lately that I can share with you guys in the chat. She doesn't really experimental an interesting colors with her painting, but her portraits are just so good. Her name is Shaq Curry. A post, a link to one of her paintings in the chat for you guys to check out if you like. For some color inspiration. She doesn't, she pushes the. He pushes the colors into a little bit more. Almost fantasy realm. Then what I do, but I've been. Inspired by how far she goes with it. And that makes me want to bring more Hughes into my skin as well. Instead of like I was saying earlier, I used to kind of just pick the one skin color and then I had a very. Yeah, we just kind of added lighter and darker versions by color and I'm trying to open my mind to all the real colors that are in the skin because it really is all over the place. Oh, I'm sorry about that, Alina. There is a bit of a delay here. It's not. It's not any problem on your end. It is something that there that is working to improve and it has actually improved a bit from the time that I first started streaming here. But there is a little bit of a delay. Sorry about that. I want to get this shadow in the corner of the mouth. And I'm really thinking about switching to the airbrush for this. Let's try it out. So it's quite a dark shadow right at the corner there. And then it kind of fades off into more of a natural skin tone color. I don't like that. So using the. Um? Lasso tool to create like a stencil kind of approach. For that shadow. Maybe it's a bit too dark. But we'll see after I add some more, I want to add a few other shadows. Maybe it'll fit in after I do that. Yeah, so just left in that a little bit emerge it down. So we have about like a little bit under 30 minutes left to work on this. Or at least that's what I'm going to try to stick to. You guys are welcome to take more time if you are painting along on this one. Now you're welcome to take as much time as you want, of course, but. Um? As far as if you wanted to like share what you did today with us long streaming, yeah you can continue to work on this one. I'm going to work on that couple other paintings after this one. So you're welcome to keep working and just share it whenever it's. It has a little bit of pressure sensitivity, so even if I put it at 100% pure white, it's not going to really 100% pure white. If you go back in color pic. It's a little bit see through. Hey Sam and thanks for coming by. I hope you're having a good day. We're doing portraits today. Sometimes it's fun to make a little shine and then erase out in there. It gives the impression of you know whatever light is reflecting in the eye. It could be a window. There could be a couple panels that could be, you know, just gives a little bit of that. Kind of affect. Look at the line for the eyelid over here. So let's look at it in black-and-white one more time. It's pretty warm over here, you guys. So I'm trying to stay hydrated. I hope you're having good weather. It's pretty nice here, it's just getting a little. Get a little post. Let me grab the hair brush. Thank you faster. Yes, so today I used a combination of brushes I used. That soft shading and blending from my free set and then I used one of my brushes. That's like sort of a modified version of that brush, but it's very similar. It's inspired by it. And I like them both together 'cause I can kind of start off with one brush. Looks a little bit. More soft and then get more precise, but you could certainly do this with a hard round brush, an airbrush combo. Would be fine for this sort of thing. Thank you, so yeah, if you guys want to download one of the brushes I was using today is in the free brush pack below. The other one is a. It's not available just yet, but it will be. So I'm using using airbrush right now. I'm making a selection and then. Open paint. In that area. Now I'm giving your smile again. From the side of her face, the lips have a little bit more shadow. Sometimes it's tricky to do these shadow areas without getting muddy colors, 'cause I do feel like that's something that's coming up a little bit here. I kind of want to soften that edge of the lip a little bit more where she has a. Transitions from her lip to the skin. Feel like it looks a little bit more natural in the photo or mines a bit too much hard edge line so I'm just going to use the. Smite brush do as much that away a little bit. She has a little bit of. Lower detail in the lower lashes, but I don't know if that will work out for me if I if I paid that or if it's going to like look creepy, sometimes it can be, but that too much. So it's nice with a smile. I know I tend to like you sometimes give my portraits little bit more of a happy expression. There's a little bit to something where when you. When you draw someone or paint someone with a certain expression, you kind of like try to imitate it yourself a little bit. I've seen some funny memes, like jokes going on about this online. I don't know if you guys have seen them, but. Sarah Sarah scribbles a comic. That has a really funny picture of like the artist drawing and like making the same face is the person she's drawing. It's like some crazy face 'cause she's doing a battle scene or something. But it's so true. I find that I tend to do that to you sometimes if I'm drawing someone is like I notice that all this, and I'll be like doing their face expression. Hey John, welcome. How are you? I don't know if I've ever ever done that on stream. Certainly notice that happening one time. I'm actually going to use liquify for a moment here to work on the eye shape. Um? Oh that's Sweet Alena. You guys are welcome to paint me if you want. Like that's totally cool. I don't know that. That I'm staying in the same position for long enough 'cause I'm kind of like turning my head, but if you want to you can. So ideally I would have fainted. These eyes correctly from the start. Wouldn't need to do liquify, but. We are using digital tools, so I'm not going to be afraid. To make some little edits. But it's up to you. If you are really looking to practice anatomy or whatnot, it's probably a good practice to go ahead and paint over mistakes. So it just depends, you know if you're doing if you're doing a study, then I think painting over the mistakes and trying to work things out is beneficial. If you are doing client work and you gotta get done and you want it to be good, then I think you know use whatever tools get the job done. But honestly, sometimes I find that. Using liquefy can help me notice what's wrong 'cause I'm not overly. I haven't really figured out what's wrong yet and I'll take liquefying kind of like move things around and then suddenly it'll be like OK, that's where it needs to be. So that's interesting thing. Sometimes I can help. You see Jackson. Oh it's scary. OK, cool enough. Thanks for letting me know. Here I am. Oh, thank you. I'm happy you think so. I had to go through a few ugly moment in this painting. I really like the I really like this process. The like the workflow that I have for these with just kind of starting out blocking things in having to be messy at the start because by the time you get finished do you do have a? I think a pretty nice effect of. Like more detail in the face less detail elsewhere, it's kind of a painterly look. Of course, I should probably do a little bit more with the hair. This is a bit. That that low effort her. But anyway I am like. Overall, I think there's there's definitely improvement to be made, but I like this workflows. So I think I'm going to be continuing with this even though it has a messy beginning. Sometimes that can be. Little hard but. Um, I'm going to put on. I'm going to try a layer on color Dodge. Because I want to give a little shine to the ear here. Yeah, the ring. Just a little bit. I just love how color Dodge looks on gold stuff. It just really it's wonderful thing magic. Yeah. I'm going to try a multiply layer to add a little bit more shadows, so I'm just using an airbrush. We got real big brush, real big round brush. Right, so so sorry, no ugly moments along the way. You're doing it wrong. Or maybe that's just me convincing myself. Is that rare painting that it doesn't go through the ugly stage? I think that happens to me like it's like once in a blue moon. That painting looks good in all phases. Such avera situation. He hung welcome. How are you? Let's take a look at the hairline here. So um, shoot her hair is parted here so there's a little bit of you can see. Up in between the where the part is a little bit. And there's a little bit of a shine. On the hair just slightly. Read says I tried this workflow multiple times, but there's too much ugly stages when I'm doing it. I'm struggling to go further so just abandoned that workflow. It's a really ugly at the start. At least I felt that way. Here we go. I don't blame you, I blame you and you know, like we all have our different workflows. We gotta find what you like. What's right for you? But I do like the style that you can get. In the end, more and more towards the end. Results. Steven says I saw a film of the animators working on Snow White as well as stills and film reference of an actress and costume. They would have a mirror next to them and imitate big, fresh and they wanted to draw that. So cool, odd that makes sense, but. It's interesting, is interesting. It's good to know that stuff because it's a perfect example of like, I think sometimes have people have the. Misconception that somehow these artists are just. Just know all this stuff in there just doing it all from scratch an I mean they might be drawing from scratch, but. You know they have all this research to help them do a good job and you know those animators, they know how to draw people they know how to draw people and animals and all that good stuff, but they're still using all that references to get the best, most accurate result they can. So that goes to show how important it is to use reference. Expect multiple other stages is really good to have. That kind of expectations, realistic expectations. I really hope it helps not be discouraged. Do you trust the process you like? Alright? I know that I just gotta go through this. I will highlight to live here. Yeah, so it'll raise a couple things that I did. Going to take the smudge brush and just move a couple areas. Get some more last edges, soft hair. Brian. You do great work. Tell me then. Trying to add a little bit of more shading on the side of her face, but I don't want it to look dirty. You know what I mean? I'm trying to make it look like there's shadow, not like there's some dirt on her like. Um? Lips need to be smaller on the side too. And then then you layer on multiplying try one more time with shadows going a little bit deeper on this side. Hopefully not getting too muddy colors. Lower the opacity a little bit. So if anybody's painting along on this one, there's about 5 minutes left. Before I'm going to end my you're welcome to keep going. On years, by the way. Trick is to make sure that ugly stages are before the painting is finished. Very good point. So we're going to do another painting after this is actually going to be a guy portrait of a guy. I tend to prefer painting women for some reason, so I know that I have a bit of a bias towards that, so I want to make sure we we paint. Ciety of portraits. So we're going to die after this. And then another lady, so I hope you will join in for one if you like. Hum, trying to side by making it look more or less like are. Overall, I'm happy with the style of his portrait. I don't think I. I don't think I nailed the likeness. I think we can tell that it's meant to be her butt. Not quite exactly her. But that's OK. And it's alright for practice. In between portraits, I'm going to take a quick break. And get a drink and maybe open my my window if it's getting it warm inside. Here, what happens when you're asking the computer? Tablets little toasty in summer. She was wearing a necklace also. I kind of disregarded that. We could add it, I'm not sure it's very important. Trying to deep in the shadow under the channel little bit. That'll more hair. I like the lighting in the portrait as well as the styling of her hair. She has like a classical look somehow. Do you have a favorite portraitist painter? Actually, I was just showing of- Checker ease work earlier. I'm going to post her up a sample of your work in the chat real quick. She is amazing. Here's one of her boyfriends. She's been inspiring me a lot because she does beautiful likenesses, but she pushes the color in my opinion, to like a little bit more almost fantasy feeling. But it's not fantasy. It still believable and realistic in a way, but it's just. She really pushes the colors into something special, so she inspires me a lot. Um? I really like how Nathan Fox does. Charcoal portraits. Huge simplifies with these sweeping strokes, which is kind of like I'm trying to get that a little bit of that approach. What I'm doing here let me see if I can find a quick sample. Of his charcoal stuff. I mean, it's unreal how good he is here. Let me show. So this is an example of his charcoal work, so you can see how strong the shapes are. Even though there's this complex detail in there, the it's still really broken up into simple shapes. Aneil type that name in the chat for anybody who's not familiar with him, definitely look up his work. He does amazing landscapes and also these great portraits. Yeah, yeah, she agrees. Really great. So who else, who else? Hum. Well, you know there's there's a lot. There's a lot of artists overtime that have inspired me with portrait painting. I feel like I'm always seeing something awesome on Instagram. Or you know, and then just like OK got it. I gotta do some portraits. Thank you Cal. Sing Michael says I'm just learning digital, but this is my current work in progress. Traditional portrait or I would love to see. Awesome guys, this is work by Michael Michael Clooney in the chat. So I think you told me that you were, um. I'm guessing this is oil correct? Or maybe maybe it's acrylic? Beautiful. See, you've got a bunch of different colors in the skin too, which is nice to see. That's what I'm kind of trying to work on. Is adding different hues to the skin to make it look more lively. Thank you for sharing that. How about any of the old dead Masters? Oh, in that case we could talk about Rembrandt, that's yeah. A lot of the actually a lot of Dutch artists. From the Dutch Golden Age are inspiring to me, and I've gotten to see some of their works. Can you write to them? And the market's house. And it's been really amazing. Although I don't regularly like. Look up their work. You know what I mean? It's one of those things. I probably should do some proper master studies. It is oil awesome. Thank you for sharing that, Michael. Oh yes, Sergeant, how could I forget foster? Yeah, that's a great example. And his environments inspire me a lot to like his watercolor environments. This is all around incredible artists. The neck of giving me a bit of a struggle here. Oh, I didn't even realize I ran out of time. I should I should have to see if we can add like a little sound effect to this. All right? So. That is the end of this portrait. For me. Hip Avalos. You make it look easy. You try to portrait yesterday, quickly realized it won't look like a human. That's OK problems. Trust me my I had a lot of portraits that were like that. It took me, Oh yeah, I've been drawing portraits. Give me 1 second. Ryan says it's funny how traditional artists have a traverse gun can devalue hundreds of years ago. Yet in 3D, arguably I don't think it's been achieved yet. I understand what you mean. I understand what you mean, definitely. Yeah, there's certain styles that I really like, but I also feel like it's not very, very fine line between creepy and cool. 3DS spectacularly difficult. Yeah, I do not. That is outside my realm. I just I appreciate 3D stuff, but beyond that I don't really know much. All right guys, we're going to move on to the next portrait, so I will keep this one. Yeah, this one is saved. Um, Oh yeah, this was the reference. OK, we can close that. Well, get all set up for the new one. So we're going to do the next. The very next portrait is. Eh? This guy, who has a little bit of a lighter background, so I think that's going to be easier because the last one, the hair was really blending into the background. This one should be a little bit easier that way. I like the strong shapes in the face. I think this one could do really well for like a stylized version. I'm going to be still painting the same way as the one before, but yeah, I thought it was interesting shapes. Hey fish and thank you. Good to see you. Also, Speaking of Sergeant, I did a master study of one of his portraits. It was too much to take in at the time, all at the same time, not only his colors. Values are great but brushwork is crazy. Good gosh. Yeah. I haven't other. I tried one to do a master study of one of his watercolors like it was a few years ago and I stopped halfway through so maybe I could try it again. But yeah. Thank you John, I appreciate it. So this is going to be another one where we will do in an hour and a half and see what we can do. Maybe it maybe I'm more warmed up now after the first one. So OK, let's make and you. Canvas. And let's see how big is this? Wow, that's very low res. Let's let's get a little bigger. Let's see 2500 pixels. Probably not going to print this. Just to study so we can make it relatively small. 30 2. Hum. OK. Alright, I think were ready. So let's make and you were going to do an hour and a half again. I'm going to talk through my process, but if you guys have any questions you're welcome to ask. Be happy to show. Anything if I know how to do it. If you if you have any specific techniques, things like that you're interested in, I could try. Publicis recently found out there's a timer built into windows. Oh cool, nice thank you. Very cool. Maybe I'll try it out. I'm working with my boyfriend's working on creating this plugin for photo shop, so I'm trying to test it out. Find a find issues here and there. OK, so I I usually like to start with a sketch, but lately I don't know if that's really been helping. I feel like I could just maybe go in with shape, so that's kind of what I ended up doing with the last one, and that seemed to be better so. So for example, I picked a color for the background that looks similar to what? Going on back there, it looks like he is standing in front of it. Looks like outdoor this is like outdoors and this light shining through this little opening. Some kind of patio type thing. I don't know. I could be totally wrong. It doesn't really matter what it is. I'm probably going to make the background allow more abstract than it actually is and just kind of put some shapes and light back here and not worry about it. I think the key thing is that the light coming from behind and we can have a nice glow back there and then do our porch on top. And that will be good. Alright, so new layer, good luck to you and everyone painting along. Thank you. Fish in thank you thank you. I appreciate it. I will take it. I will take the look. So I'm going to try to block in big to small shapes so. Let's begin with. Our body hears this is all. This darkish blue with a little bit of a teal kind of tint to it and some of the highlights, but we'll get to that. And then. I will block in the. Skin. Not really the right shade, but we'll just. We'll just put it in there and get started. So I'm in the phase where I'm just kind of like imagining that I'm putting big globs of paint on the canvas. If this was a traditional, which is kind of putting the paint in relatively the right place, and then we're going to work from. Vague too from like rough to specific on these things. Start out. A bit messy. So this kind of brush really helps me to make strong shapes. I think. I mean, I don't know that any of these shapes are remarkably strong, but you can see what I mean about the hard edges is kind of forces me to. Commit to some kind of shapes because of the edges. I think I'm just going to paint him right onto the background because the background is not anything complicated that I'm going to have to go back and want to be able to move them around without messing up the background. It's just like that. I'm going to go with this kind of flat color, so I think it's going to be easier for me to be able to quickly color, pick and cut into shape if I want, so I'm just going to paint it all in one. Layer. So what I am trying to trying to look at our. Basic shapes of the head and proportion, so we've got almost like a rectangle for the head first, and then it sort of cuts in. So where does the jawline start? Where is this curve take place and it's above the like the shoulder kind of points up to it. So get something like that. And then over here the shoulder is lower. So I kind of I try to use. To make things parts of body work in relationship to where I paint something else. So that kind of helps. I'm trying to think it's attire. Is it slower? And then there's a white shirt. So we've got this sharp triangle shape upside down triangle. And we always slip. I gave her quite a swoop. It's kinda funny when I flip it like this is like very obvious. Have to go with my senior paint for a bit, mattie by our thanks for hanging out for a bit. Have a great rest of your day, will see you soon. So I've been painting this kind of like a graphic style almost at the beginning here. Let's get in some more colors and things. So new layer. Sometimes I like to color pic from my curtain current colour and then move it from there to get a new color. So it doesn't seem so random. If I find that I make colors that feel a little bit more cohesive to my painting. If I do this. So there's a little bit of a warmer color to the skin on the face here too, and let's work on placement of like eyebrows and things so. So we can be on the same line as our reference up here. Look up. Eyebrows Guys here. God knows. Here. Funny. So just keep in mind like how it's. We're kind of just putting the placement of things now. So I would really. Like I hope it helps to see this process and know that like the early stages. Uh, something like this? How kind of silly that it looks, relatively speaking compared to like the photo. If you look like we're going to look at what we're going for. So please don't give up if you feel like you're starting up portrait or starting something and you're like, Oh my gosh, I can't do this. You gotta build up off of it. Maybe, maybe someday you know. I mean, I think as as you improve, I think that it helps. The earlier stages. Will you kind of work through the earlier stages. More quickly I guess. But yeah, 'cause it doesn't matter. How experienced you are the early stages are going to be. Be a little rough. But yeah, so right now I'm just working on. I've heard people say that you're kind of thinking about it out. If you are like squinting your eyes or something like that. I don't really like to do that. 'cause it kind of gives me a headache, but I get the idea. Or like if you wear glasses for example. It's like. If you took off your glasses, I guess that depends on what your prescription is, but you want imagine like a slightly blurred version of. The reference when you're starting out, and if you're if you're working in this workflow, there's a lot of other ways to work. You could certainly go with a process where you kind of make a very detailed sketch or drawing and work from that. That's one way to do it. This picture has a little bit of like a blue tint to it. All of the dark shadows in this picture feel a little bit shifted towards blue. That might be some kind of post processing thing with the photo. I generally try not to choose photos that have too much. Filter or tinting or anything like that to them. 'cause I find it difficult but I really, really liked the shapes in this portrait so I thought I would do it anyway. And those facial hair. So this should be a good challenge. Up, I'm just going to paint this area darker. I'm going to treat the facial hair like. I don't know that it's creating a shadow kind of look. I'm not going to draw individual hairs yet, but we might get in there and do some magic individual hairs. But we're just going to right now. Kind of give again as if we're looking at this as a bit blurry, just whereas the where the shadows were the lighter areas. So the hair under the nose above the mouth sound like this. You gotta nostrils. Here and here. And if you're if you're questioning if you're putting things in the right place. Keep an eye on your reference. For example, just been not words. What does the nostril lineup with? If you go directly up or down? The natural kind of the circular inside of the natural kind of lines up with the edge of the eye. Roughly. So you can keep that. Keep looking at those landmarks to check our proportion and like locations of things. Alright, let's figure out the lips. 'cause I'm wondering, maybe I didn't give enough room for the lips. Top lip is kind of disappearing right now. So let's forget about how I need to move some things around it. But look, he's starting to come out of. Who the blurriness of faces forming from the blurriness? So let's find the corners of the mouth. We can bring those down from. Center of the I. You got pretty serious expression. Steven says if I take off my glasses I wouldn't be able to see the reference at all and we're just walked into warm room from outside and glasses missed something exactly. Yeah, yeah exactly. It's all relative, I guess if you have the perfect prescription of yeah, then it it could work, but. I have a relatively low prescription. I do have glasses and Contacts that I wear if I if I'm going to be driving or. Need to look at things at a distance. I'm nearsighted so everything like around me. When I'm, you know, at home or something like that everything is like I can see well enough. But I think I think I need a new prescription actually. Haven't had I've had my glasses for maybe four or five years now and I think I'm starting to feel that I needed new one. It'll like no. Makes sense that the hairs would create a shadow effect. Then here on top. Yeah yeah Foster. I'm trying to think about it that way and it's so far is going better than when I've tried to paint individual hairs in the past. It's so strange because. That's actually more work to go in and paint all the hairs, and it's kind of sad that it's kind of ironic that it's like more work, but I feel like it looks better to not do it, but that's a great news. Realize it. If you're going for hyper realism then of course, or if you're going to get really detailed in the end, you can go in and pay more hairs, but kind of nice that you can give the impression without. Going in and doing all that. Alright, so. The lips I still feel like I haven't given enough room for the lips. Maybe I need to just. Like bring down the channel bit more of the jaw. So for example, I'm going to make a selection. Here we go. Layer new layer via copy or control J and just kind of. Bring that down. Give him allergic chin. I just feel like I didn't leave enough room to actually put the. Lips and their kind of cramped so it gets a little better. There's not much of a change. But OK, good. Let's try again with the corners of the mouth is going to go a little lower. Good morning from Brazil. Good morning Nathan welcome. I hope you're having a good day so far. Um? Let's get the skin around the lips in the right shape and then maybe. That will help bring out the lip shape. So for example, you see this highlight on the skin right around the lips like sort of between the facial hair where it sort of papers off. There's some areas where the hairs slightly left. Hi Nicholas, good day from Australia welcome. Thanks for being here. You guys, if anybody wants to check out the reference images they are linked below the stream in the description or on top of the chat. If you put the info tab you can download them their build links in the description will link to the original photographers post. These photos are from Pexels Unsplash. So we are free to use these images for studies. And you guys are welcome to do a little sketch with me if you like and share what you do or just relax and enjoy this stream. But I appreciate you being here. We did a painting before this one. That's this one right here. And this was about an hour and a half, so we're doing our onehalf studies today. Trying to squeeze in three of those. So he's looking over to the right. Let's get some whites of the eyes in although. Because he's looking. We're kind of looking at him. He's looking down a little bit, not straight down, but kind of. Little bit down we're seeing his eyelashes come over the eyes so we see a little white set eyes. But there a bit obscured. It's not going to be super Super Bright. And we're going to see the eyelid will increase. So I think I've made his eyes look like he's going looking a little too far to the right. We do see why it's the eyes on the right, both in both eyes so. That should fix that. I really like portraits where the. You get an unusual angle on the eyes like this. I think it's really cool. I'm let me show the reference up close real quick so you guys can see what I'm talking about. I really like how. We get this angle, so it's not just like that traditional shape of the eye that you always see. If the person is looking at you is something a little bit more interesting things. So let's take a look at that. Never been able to squint when I try my right eye closes altogether. I just always found whenever I tried to do that whole squint squinting to see the reference without. And other details that it just gives me a headache. It really doesn't make me feel well to like, squint across my eyes or anything so I don't bother with it, but you can. In photo shop you can put a blur filter on your reference or something like that if you really want to have that experience without the headache, so that's that's nice. Can put a filter on it. Alright, let's get a shadow or highlight mean to say on the nose. The lighter Noses are probably my least favorite part of the face to paint. Um? I don't hate it, but it's just I find the lip shapes in the eye is like more satisfying and I kind of just feel like I have to get through the. I'm waiting at the lowest. Oops. We are, it says I don't bother squinting. Well, whatever you do, it works out just fine. Everything is one big blur anyhow. Do you need new glasses like me? Hey Norman, welcome. Thank you for joining us. So I'm kind of slowly getting darker and darker with the details. I was getting more contrast. The lighter and darker. I'm trying to pay note around the. The. Eyebrows there's little highlights. I feel like I've made him look like he's raising his eyebrows like he's given a look like. You know what I'm saying? I probably need to lower them a little bit. Alright, So what will do is looking at proportions. I think I'm going to make a selection of the eyes. And just copy that onto a new layer again with control J. Try that again. So make a selection layer new layer via copy. There we go. So now I can move the eyes up 'cause I think there's an issue. Ah. Yeah. Or I can move the the eyebrows down trying to figure out which what was the things out of place here. Something down please. Which one is it? So I think moving the moving the eyebrows down is better because. The other parts of the face seemed to be an OK proportion. An Ollie I'm sorry it sounds a bit annoying, stuck between a rock and a hard place. Oh boy. I hope you find solution for it. Alright, so below the nodes there's a little bit more shadow here under the nostrils. So hopefully that'll make the nose look like it's kind of popping out a little bit more. Let's establish the outside of the nose shape. Apps. Alright, let's slip. I would be pretty happy if I could end up getting a decent likeness to this. Portrait. We'll see how it goes. So it's a little bit more color to the lips than what I have to add that. And try to pay attention through nuances like I think towards the center of the lip or the tulips meet. There's a little bit more of a reddish saturated color and then towards the edges. It's a little bit cooler, the lid color. I think is normal. Standard lip stuff. I like to turn the layer on and off after I've done some work to kind of check on it, so make sure I'm going in the right direction. Sometimes it's satisfying, other times you realize this. And fix that. So I think we're doing alright. You guys are cracking me up. I have that stuff happening too and I'm like. Oh boy. Sometimes I sleep in a weird angle. And get some random neck pain or something. Mostly it doesn't happen that too often, but it does happen. Alright, I think I need to work on the. The eyes hi ash can please tell the brushes you would use in this. That is a good question I. Have been sticking to a couple brushes actually. If you want you can download some brushes for free below my stream. In the description there's a pack that you can download and one of them has a brush called soft shading and blending. It looks like this. And this is the type of brush that I've been painting. Almost, you know, the whole painting with so far. I recently made like a modified version of that brush that looks like this. It's literally almost exactly same brush. It's like a little bit less transparent, but it's like basically the same brush. So if you want a brush that functions like what I'm doing here you can download it for free. It's the soft shading and blending brush in the painterly brush set. There's a link to it below. And I've actually been using this brush so far. That's the only brush I've used for this painting an I think that it really makes a difference to use one brush like that I have. I will also use a an airbrush to do some shading and stuff, especially if I want to like use a layer on multiply an just add like a soft area of shadow across part of the face or something like that. I will use use an airbrush, but almost all of this is. With this one brush, I like this brush because it has. One soft edge and one hard edge so you can get hard edges, which is important, but you also get that one edge that softly dissolves into the rest of the painting, and I think it makes a nice painterly kind of feeling. But the key is you have to be willing to kind of push through the ugly stages in a painting because I found that this workflow using the one brush the whole time. If you kind of start off and things don't necessarily look great at the beginning, but you gotta keep painting over. From like the rough look at the start and just keep painting over until things look better. Alright, so adding little shadow under the list there's. Little shadow there and her growing. The other brush that I like to use a lot for this is a smudge brush so that brushes in the pack two so you would. Click the little finger. Much brush icon and then select the brush that you want to use as your smudge brush. Again. There's one in the pack. I like to use it in anywhere between 10 and 30% strength. Usually you'll see it behaves differently depending on the string and you can use this to smudge and blur away. Hard edges if you are using this kind of brush and the hard edges are too much somewhere, you can just nudge that out. Oh, you're welcome yash. I hope you enjoy the brushes. There's a lot of other brushes in that pack that I really like that are. Sort of different that this one. Like a style we're doing, here is a bit more like smooth. There's a lot of textured brushes in that package or nice for other things. OK, so I'm going to merge down what I did so far on to one layer. Actually. Yeah, let's do it. I'm going to make a new layer and start adding a next next level of shadows is right now. Things are pretty were missing that deep contrast servicing deep shadows, so the wrinkles in the shirt shadows where the collar meets up with the skin and stuff like that. So this might be a good time to use multiply. We can try it anyway. It doesn't look good. Let's go back to normal layer, but I'm putting this layer on multiply mode. In that way. Whatever we paint, this is a layer on. Multiply it a little, paint over what's already there, but it won't like you wipe it out. It's not like painting on a regular layer. You can still see through it a little bit. Not sure how that's going to work on the clothing though. It's a flat layers. Doesn't really matter if we use multiplies. I think I will do the clothes on a regular layer, so if you see this type of shirt it seems like. The edges. Kind of get this lighter blue highlight. Over here. The edge is facing towards. A light source, a little bit more, it seems like, so you get a whole area that's. Brighter. So I'm trying to stay zoomed out and look at this. I mean you see I'm not going in and painting individual little tiny wrinkles. Kind of trying to make a big sweeping brush strokes to just block in where the wrinkles are very large shaped. And then we'll do min. Alright, I think it's getting a little bit better. Oh, what the heck? Oh my God, it's so funny. Sorry for this picture of cloud that was really random. I quit. I meant to click on the reference picture, but I had that open so I was finished trying to finish a painting of cloud from another stream. Oh my God. Please, please excuse. I. So random OK. Yeah, hopefully I'll eventually post that soon because if you guys are gonna be Final Fantasy fans in here have an unfinished cloud fan art. All right? But anyway, back to this guy. There's a little bit of a blue Sheen to the hair too, so it makes me feel like maybe there's some kind of filtering on this, but it does look cool. I don't mind it. So there's some warmer colors can shining through the hair too. So we'll add those. Keep things interesting. Right? The delay now just seeing you guys. You need a holiday. I I do guys. I have a holiday coming up by the way, thank you for. Bringing that up. I am actually taking some time off. So I won't this will be my last stream here on be hands until after my holiday. I'm taking two weeks off the first 2 weeks of July. So for those of you who usually watch me here, I really appreciate it. I'll miss you guys, but I will be back. Yeah, the first 2 Wednesdays in July. I won't be here but after that. Nice version of Final Fantasy character. Thank you, Lena. After that I will be back. Will be back to our normal. Regularly scheduled painting sessions. Alright, so bring them into darker shadows here. I think it's good for the highest contrast areas to be near and around the face, 'cause That's going to bring contrast will draw RI. Thank you for a designer. I appreciate that I will. It's been, it's been awhile. I definitely will take a break. I'm planning to. Take a visit to some nature parks and forests near where I live. That always makes me feel. Rejuvenated and inspired. I usually take lots of photos for painting and things like that, so maybe will do some environment paintings together when I get back and have lots of photos work from. Probably just more a little bit more of like a staycation. Steven, just because, well, because of all the covid stuff, I think it's probably for the best not to do any real extensive travels, but just taking a sort of a break from work for a little bit, Ann. Make up to catch up on some personal projects. Visit nature parks and forests. I live in the Netherlands and there's a lot of beautiful places to see here, so will be staying in the country and just taking it easy, but hopefully spending a lot of time outside. I hope there's going to be nice weather. Ha ha ha. Yeah right, good plan. Good plan. Original you might. My sister was coming to visit me. So that's what this holiday was originally scheduled for. Was that my sister was going to come to visit. She lives in the US. She lives in on the West Coast, so she was going to come and unfortunately, you know her flight and everything got cancelled. So I decided to still take the time off for myself. Have a little mental health break and. Little mini vacation. Well good vacation. At during the time that my sister was supposed to come here. So it's sad that I won't be seeing here, but I think it'll still be nice to have half the time off. And I really appreciate you guys being supportive of that. Alright, I think it's time to work on the eyes, even though they're one of the things I like the most in the scene. In the portrait I've been procrastinating on them, so let's do it. Thank you bro, I appreciate that. Matty will come back pain, yeah, maybe that would be nice. That would be nice. There is a lot of reflection in the eyes. I think he has some. Brown eyes, but we've got a lot of reflection. From the light, the blue light source on the left. So I can bring some of that in. I'm trying to pay attention to the curve of the lower eyelid. Think it explains a lot in the shape of the. You know the direction his eyes are looking that we kind of get this kind of look. Yes, yes I am. I have a Wakame Centriq 22. That's the model of my tablet. If you're curious if anybody is like shopping around for tablets and you want information below my stream, there's a link recommended tablet review site. That's Bradley call beau. He does a lot of tablet reviews. He does videos on YouTube and he's got a website blog where he reviews tablets and he's really good. Really knowledgeable in the the. The reviews are very helpful if you're shopping around because there's. There's a lot of different options. I love my tablet. I love my centriq, but it's not necessarily like it's a bit of the higher end. So if you're looking to, if you're starting out and you're if you go and look up the tablet that I have, don't feel like that's the one that you have to get. There's more affordable options. I do love this one, though I would definitely give it a good review. But there's a lot of options out there. Uhm screen tablet wise or pen tablet. This nose shape is really got me a little bit puzzled. I think part of The thing is. The top of the nose is like a little bit darker an it's kind of illuminated from the sides. And that is. Confuse me. Just a little bit. Yeah, it's better. Same as high there. Welcome. Hope you having a good day. We're doing portraits. Purchase studies today. And let's go a little bit darker on the lower. Eyebrow. On the top were able to see it's a little bit the hairs like little bit more sparse and. See through the skin tone a little bit more. This is this is where we can draw some individual little hairs or getting close to drawing little hairs sort of groups of hairs. But we don't want to zoom in. Get too crazy. Greetings from Turkey all thank you. Well, I hope you're doing good. Thanks for joining us. Papa There are some more affordable options these days, even from from welcome. The Centriq 16. And the welcome 1 tablet. Those are two screen tablets they offer that are. On a more affordable range compared to. You know, when I was first buying a tablet, they didn't have any kind of options like that, so it's definitely come along way. And there's other brands too, so you guys can check out the links below my stream for more info. And you're welcome to ask in the chat if you're thinking about getting a specific tablet, because oftentimes, even if I don't know about it, somebody might be using it in the chat and might be able to give you. Semantic information. Steven says I recently got a welcome one, which is basically much cheaper version of this antique. Yeah the welcome one. That is. Yeah, it seems like a good value. I was really surprised. About that tablet. Like pleasantly surprised, because those options are coming out. I hope your hope you're enjoying yours. So I keep making new layers. I like to make me Raiders paint for awhile. Turn the layer on and off the How's it going? And decide if I want to merge. There's some crazy colors like with his random green and cyan color reflecting off the hair. It's kind of fun. Oh wow. Warehouse even that's not cheap. Yeah, this antique. 16 inch Yeah, the UM. With around 600 euros, I think here in the Netherlands, which is not cheap, but. In the in the realm of's antiques. It's a little bit more affordable. Well, if any of you guys are painting along, I hope it's going well and that you're enjoying your painting. I'm enjoying painting this guy. I picked this reference because I thought he had very strong. Um shapes in the face like angles and shapes and. Yeah, I'm I'm enjoying N Niagara face. I'm actually feel like I'm able to see. See the shapes easier. Some people that have I don't know. Some faces that are less like sharp with the angles. I feel like I'm not as good at picking out how to what to emphasize this one is helping me. Michael says, but it into its pro medium and I'm very pleased with it. As a solid tablet might go, that's like. I think that's a classic. I think it's a really like. Solid and safe choice. The good thing about the interest is that the pressure sensitivity is really great. Alot of pros use those tablets too. But They're not crazy crazy expensive. Oh I see Pablos Yeah, so I don't have the H. Oh I have the HD not before King. I don't have the 4K tablet. I've never tried one eye. I'm, I think it's one of those things that I've got to avoid for awhile 'cause I'm like I'm like satisfied with mine now. I wonder if I try to 4K one, I'm suddenly going to going to want to get that one. Meanwhile, I'm very happy so I don't want to ruin it. Anyway, thanks for Chiming in. Guys, it's always nice to hear from people. Have tried different ones and things. For anyone who's looking, I think it can be helpful. Alright, so I'm gonna go back and work on my eyes again. I've been bouncing around. Saying I'm going to work on the eyes, but I end up doing other stuff so. See, they're pretty pretty dark with a nice reflection of light. She probably zoom in on my reference. So something to look at when you're painting eyes is to notice the the people in iris. How much of them? How much of that part of the eye is like covered up by skin? So for example, here you know if you draw the if you actually have the white space underneath, it's going to create a very very different effect than if it's just barely touching the skin, or if the skin is like coming up over it. And so in this case. Part of his eye is covered and you know that will affect the expression. If someone has a little bit of Squint, or if the eyes wide open. All that kind of stuff. I'm going to give a little bit of a crease for the eyelid here. And keep it pretty low. And same thing over here. There's a crease. Something like that. Alright, that's better. I think that was a big thing that was missing. I'm trying to work on painting the shapes around the. But I thought she plywood. Mike and stuff. Still think my eyebrows are too high. Well, how did they manage making them so high? He looks like he's surprised so. Alright, Here we go. Eyebrow. Adjustment Part 2. So just bring him down. It's great being able to do this. I have to say. Being is also a traditional painter. It's really nice to not have to repaint something that's. Working is it needs to move a little bit. So yeah, I think that's a little better. Merge went down. Hey Homer, how are you? So let's take a look at the corner of the eye. But foreigners we've got a little bit of eyelashes kind of pointing down like this. And there's also eyelashes coming down in front of the I. I don't know if I'm going to include those or not. Not sure how messy that's going to come across sometimes. Get a lead out, little details 'cause. Well that's our that's artist prerogatives inside. But I like the corner on the shadow in the corner here. Over here I think I got a little too. Too far with the outward curve and bend of the lower eyelid so. Bring that back. In a little bit. So I want to add the shadows under the eyelids without it making him look too good. No tired. Now it just looks curious, not surprised. He's like what's going on over there. I'm not sure what to do about that. Just going to keep painting see what happens. In the reference now, like looking at their original like let me show you now realize he looks a little bit like. Actually, fairly like expressionless. He's got pretty much of a stoic face. Maybe looks a little disgusted. I don't know, I don't know. But I keep, I keep infusing different expressions into him that are not there. So I was realizing just now that the house making it a classic mistake, you guys, the bottom of the nose was like not lining up properly with the top of the the lips like they should be perfectly like the, you know saying that op. The center of the nose needs to line up perfectly with the center of the lips and the way I had it. The lips were like. A little bit. Center the lips was a little bit to the left of the center of the nose, so I'm trying to fix that now. That is something that usually. Stands out more to me. I didn't notice it, but. It's good to have on your checklist of things to look for. Funny how much eyebrows effect expression right expression is like Oh Man, I feel like it's like 90% I rose. Of course. Of course the mouth too, but. Eyebrows are so much. Adam Warren, thank you. Thank you so much for the nice comments and welcome. We are doing some portrait studies anytime that I do studies on stream, they are group studies. So anybody who wants to is welcome to join in. It's very casual. I share my references in the info panel below the stream and if you want to just take the reference and paint along, you will be welcome to were just practicing and you're welcome to share whatever you paint in the chat if you feel comfortable or keep it to yourself and just have it be a practice. And that's where anyone who wants to join in. But you're also welcome, just relax and enjoy the stream. Appreciate you stopping in. I'm working on the mouth and. The eyes right now kind of bouncing around. I should probably work on the news two. Basically we're just getting to that final layer of detail. I've been working on this study for about an hour. We've been doing hour and a half. Photo studies. So this one we've been doing for a little while. And we're in the final stages, so I'm trying to. Pull pull it together. Let's add some more shines in the eyes. I think I tried that and ended up painting over it. So we're going to add blue. A blue shines coming from the left. That's a lot. It definitely makes the. Makes the I look more rounded. Ah thanks Judy Hey. I hope you're having a good day. Thanks for popping in. If anybody is either just getting here, or if you have to leave and are going to miss part of stream and you're interested, you can always. Check it out later. Any of my streams that I've done here? They are available to re watch if you go to my profile and click on the video tab. It has all my past streams. And one really cool thing that the be hands has is this tool timeline. So it captures the tools that I'm using as I use them and when you watch a replay it will show you the tools like the colours that I'm taking the name of the brushes and stuff like that. If you find it hard to follow along. Of course you can always ask me stuff if I do something. Fast or you know, if you have any questions. There's a little bit of a shadow here. I think this is something that I'm missing that's a little bit of like a like a likeness thing for him to make it look more like him. This shadow here. Now I'm like making him look a little bit, maybe maybe a little older than than he is looking at the photo. Partially. That's what happened when you use when you use hard edge brush is. So what I can do is duplicate this layer just so I can. Go back if I don't like what I do, but I can take the smudge brush and blur out some of the details so the skin will appear a little bit smoother. I do like the hard edges and I don't want to move them all out, but if you're depending on how old the person is your painting. What look you're going for? You might want to smooth out. Yeah, I think that's a little better. Hi RJ, welcome and thanks. The other reference images are below the stream or about the chat info tab. You can find the links. In both places. We're going to do 1 one more portrait after this one. So if you guys are interested in seeing one from the beginning, if you're just getting here will start a new one soon. Let me do some more work on the hair, I've been real. Um? Then ignoring the hair basically. But for me, with the portrait is a lot more important to paint the the person that we can do, sort of like a rough. Sort of fade out around the hair and get less. Let's detailed. Living the style is anyone painting along. Thank you, Nicholas. I hope so. But it kind of depends from stream to stream. People happen to have time to join in. New to this, but definitely want to try this. I would love that you guys are always always welcome to join me every time that I stream here I do a like a group session like this. Today is going to be my last. Unfortunately it's my. I have two weeks that it won't be streaming coming up. Usually it's every single Wednesday, so the next two Wednesdays after this. I won't be here, but then I'll be back to normal schedule of every Wednesday again. But there's a bunch of past videos available in the meantime, let me check out what POV Lowe's is up to. Yes Pablos. OK guys, so this is not the one I'm working on of course, but in my discord server. We are doing these group study sessions and our current topic is portraits. This is one of the other references. This is Great Pablos did you say? Is this a work in progress? Are you still working on it? I painted a different art clip image. Yeah, I was going to say 'cause it feels. Well, I don't know if you're going to do more, but I kind of like how you stylize this. It feels like it could be done. You could go ahead and add more shading if you wanted to, but the style that you've done this in it feels like it could be complete like this. I'm curious what you're up to, but. Nice job, definitely get that feeling that this is like from a below angle. The way that you did the eyes. Very cool. Haha, cool, thank you Pablo. Thanks for sharing. By the way, you guys can download some brushes from below. In the description as well, if you want. I'm going to go switch to the Airbrush and try to smooth it out. Again, a little bit, 'cause again I think I'm. Making him look. Older than he is. You can actually do a fair amount of painting with the airbrush. A lot of people shy away from the Airbrush, understandably because you know if you are. If you're only using the airbrush, you're not going to be able to get hard enough edges. But sometimes it's nice. To paint in soft things. Like a little shine on the side of the nose, you can do that with the. With an airbrush. An areas like this, for example, you can take the lasso tool, make a selection. And then I want the shadow to be like under the shirt, so you can kind of use the airbrush block that in you get a nice hard edge. I think I'm going to smudge it out a little bit. 'cause kind of intense. But we can do the same thing up to the jacket. Make a selection and then add a little shadow under the jacket on to the shirt. Play Adele Menu. Windsor and Newton quash arrived today. I'm excited to try them. I'm very curious to hear what you think about it. I think you're going to love them. I kind of use my whole Binder Winsor Newton interchangeably. And. I think they really really nice. But you have to let me know. I haven't tried all that many colors from Windsor Newton. So I feel like the ones I've tried. I've been good, but I don't have like gold. Large range to review them. So yeah, still use an airbrush. Adding in some shadows, just looking at the reference to indicate like where I need to direction things up a little bit like the general line here. Let's go back to the hard edge brush. Clean up that caller. You can do a little bit more work on the wrinkles here. Just a little bit. We're just kind of hinting at stuff it's not really about the clothes. But the area that's up near his face. I do think it's nice to do a little bit of extra work there, so. It's a subtle transition from things looking more polished to like the messier edges of the. Canvas. Will do a little bit more here. There's a seam up here. Yeah, well shadow. Just even Swatch sheets and some color mixing that sounds good. I should have done this. Watch is for my Windsor new colors they got. OK, so for the hair, I like that the hair is mostly like one big shape so I think it reads fairly well, but I want to add some texture to the edges, for example over here. We can maybe. Where is my brush? OK, I'm going to go to shape dynamics and make the minimum diameter of my brush smaller. So this means that it comes more to appoint. And I'm going to add. Some. The more hairs her groups. I keep it pretty with B. I like portraits that have a little bit more of a romanticized kind of five, you know, and nothing too too polished. 'cause I like that. Letting your brain kind of fill in some of it and just getting the. The feeling of of the portrait in the. The character of the person. This side is little tricky, so there's light shining through here. I didn't do the background exactly like it is in the reference, but I could brighten things up back here and then. That would help explain the color that is shining through the her little bit more. Speed. We have highlight there. Eyebrow. And it's really squared off. I think the facial hair needs to go up a little higher towards the nostrils. Yeah, getting closer. Well, if anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well. You're welcome to take more time if you need it. I'm going to be. Starting another one after this portrait, but you're welcome to keep going and share it anytime if you want before the end of my stream or both of my discord leader. If anybody uses discord and you're interested in joining my server, you can find a link below and description, but we. Why do our chairs and shared tutorials and? Reference images and stuff like that. In there you guys are welcome to join. So finally getting to the individual hairs. I wasn't sure if I was going to do that or not. But I think we can certainly hint at them a little bit like this. I'm not going to go in and draw every hair, but just a little bit of texture to show that. I wonder if we can kind of do the opposite thing to add like a reverse texture like this skin. It's kind of weird, but. I'm going to find think I prefer going with the hair though. Yeah, I don't know that's so weird like sometimes. I am not sure if I if I like the smooth version better, I mean. The little stubble gives more detail, but it also kind of. Takes away some of those sharpies eatery cheap. Hi Adriana, thank you welcome. Without a little bit more shadow here in his eyes, if you like mines a little too too light in that corner. Better. In the back to the hair. It's so interesting how a couple little hair strands can do alot. I kind of try to stick to making the hair all one shape and then adding Little Flyaways. Makes it a lot easier. So I do flip my campus a lot and whenever I do that, I'm also flipping my reference on the other monitor. So if you're wondering like why is the. Reference on the screen facing the wrong way. I just don't bother flipping that one every time 'cause it would be flipping. Be doing a lot of extra keystrokes, but I do flip the monitor. I do flip the reference on my other monitor. Hi Jefferson, how are you? Welcome. I like this little pink reflection color. I think I need to add that over here too. Hey Najib, Na wow, good job thank you. Pretty much. I appreciate it. Are you using a mouse? No, I am using a tablet. I have a screen tablet. It's the Wakeham Sintec 22. I'll put the name of it in the chat. Yeah, I have been doing a lot of practice. And you guys are welcome to join anytime that I stream here I stream my study sessions. And I will share my reference images, so you're welcome to paint with me and. Post your working chat if you like. Something needs to remember when buying glasses to check the Opaqueness. Yeah, I was thinking about that too. Adele, like the fact that some colors are more pink than others. And that's something that I want to start paying attention to in watercolor too. Because that one green color that I got recently, even though I really like it, it's so opaque compared to the rest of my paints. It's really strange. I think it really stands out. So I want to look for an alternate color. Nicholas says I tried digitally sketching a portrait in black and white recently, let's see. Whoa, this is awesome. Guys, this is from Nicholas in the chat. This is really good. Where you going for like a traditional kind of five? That's what I'm getting like. Kind of like charcoal or graphite has a very traditional feeling. Nicely done. Alright, I'm getting it almost the end of mine here. And. So zooming out just to see what more can I do. So I'm going to sing something here in just like the basic shape. Face shape. I feel like the if you look at the reference, his face is more. Wide at the top than the bottom versus what I've done, so it's like I need to make this shift I'm showing here. I'm just making a selection and. Changing the angle slightly. Yeah wow. Could really, really help to just zoom out. Even though I have my navigator window open on the other monitor sometimes. Sometimes just gotta zoom out. Slow down. How about the other side with any other problems with that? So it might be fun to do some lighting effects to show the glow from the background. I'm going to put a layer on color. Dodge will be careful we don't go crazy, but. I'm going to double click and uncheck the transparency shapes layer. And add some highlights. Sort of color pic from this warm color and I'm going to lower the opacity. My brush color Dodge can go real crazy and I'm going to just. To have a little bit of light behind. So in the reference you kind of get that there's some areas that are. There are real bright. And we can take the. Eraser and just kind of go back and turn it down a little bit, so I think that's kind of nice. And also as if you watered down opaque colors, it works OK. Cadmium colors and seem a little flat and watercolor 'cause how peak they are. Interesting, yeah, I don't think I got any cadmium colors in my new set, which I guess is good. Well, I'm almost done here. We have 10 minutes left, so let me work on the clothes a little bit. I'm just going to 1st take this much brush and kind of smudge away some of the hard edges on the clothing wrinkles, especially as they get further to the bottom of the canvas. I want them to be not so eye catching the hard edges. I'll keep our focus towards the face I think. So if anybody knew how it works with sharing your art, if you gonna paint along on one of these whenever you're done, you can just. Post your art somewhere that you have a URL and then you could just post the URL in the chat so we can take a look at what you what you painted, but you're welcome to take more time if you want. 'cause I'm going to do another portrait after this so you can just keep working if you're still. Still on this one. We can add a little shadow a little bit more. To the center of the lip, especially the top lip. Might be a little bit more shadow on the underside of the top lip. Thanks Mattie, enjoy the morning. Have a good holiday. Thank you Michael. I appreciate that. Thanks for hanging out those. I'll have a great rest of the day. And take care. Alright, will definitely get a little more polished to the lips. Cool, thank you. That's awesome. So it is a thing. I'm going to grab the. Airbrush on a multiply layer. And just use that to darken. The front here. Just in the corners at least. Don't really want our I getting attracted there. Want to be more? Only character? The person I can make an adjustment layer. So that would be if I take my layers palette here. If you go to the. Yeah, the half circle icon. We could choose something like brightness, contrast levels. Sometimes it's nice to add like little extra contrast. In the area that you want people to focus on, and we can kind of mask out. That contrast elsewhere in the. In the painting, so sort of like a big net of it could lower the capacity a little bit. Yeah, though I think I notice that too with both of the brands that I've used. Alright, well technically I have like a minute or so left, but I don't know what else I'm going to do I feel like I'm pretty much finished with this. Not that it's perfect, but. I'm not sure what I can do in that time. So I think I'll probably call it done here. Yeah, so save that. Alright, so consume in. This is my portrait of this guy. 2nd portrait of the day. You guys are welcome to keep working an if you if you want you can share. You don't have to say. I always appreciate is practicing with me and. I don't want you to ever feel like. Hum. Like you have to share. You know if you don't feel comfortable with that. But you're welcome to you if you want. You can post your art in the chat. Other than that, we're going to do one more one more painting. And I will get that image set up now. I will probably take one more quick stretch break in between this painting and the next one. If you want the link to the next painting, you can find it below the stream. 11 year painterly style for portraits. Well done. Thank you foster before work. Maddie thank you Brian. Thanks Lee art. I'm definitely having more fun painting portraits these last few. A few attempts I think. I finally found a workflow that I've been enjoying more between these. Thank you for the nice comments, I appreciate it. This is going to be our next portrait. It's a beautiful photo. I love the whole composition, it's just like so clean and nice. I really like the, you know her jewelry and the. Their head rap and just the shininess on the skin. Everything is like, really, really pretty so. This is going to be the next one. I will put that on my other monitor next to chat. Salmon network. Mattie, I think the eyes are what make the porch are alive. Thank you thank you. Hi Andy, welcome. Hope you're having a good day. We're doing portraits today. This was the second one. This was the first one. And we're about to start another one in just a few just a few minutes. I am going to. Make a new canvas. Let's get pure ref here. I'll take a quick stretch break and refill my water and I will be back to start the next painting. Happy painting everyone. This one I think that I think one of the challenges in this one is the same thing that was challenging. The very first painting of the day, which is that the background is like roughly the same, like there's not a huge contrast in brightness between the background and I keep saying character, but it's like the person, the first, the first portrait, she was really dark. Lighting. And she also it was hard to. See. So if we turn this into black and white. You can see that the there's brightness on her and there's brightness in the background. Um? It's not. The background is like a lot lighter or darker than hers. Is it kind of like relatively the same value? So do pay attention to that, 'cause that could be a little bit of a tricky thing. But I love her look and the environment of this kind of like tropical vibe 2. I don't know if you guys can tell what I'm always wearing like floral, floral and leaf aesthetics and things so. Alright, let's start with a green background. Will just put a green background. And I thank you for the welcome someone. Thank you. I'm just going to make some blobs of color in the background. I think I'll turn on color dynamics. I don't know if it's really going to do anything. Do you see this striping effect? It's very barely noticeable. Color dynamics affect on my brushes. Creating that striping effect, and I think it's nice sometimes when you're trying to just quickly add a whole bunch of hues and colors to something. But you could do this with any number of ways. You can just get any kind of brush and. Make it crazy background. I just want to background that looks like sort of out of focus, shrubberies and things. Alright, so now. Good numbers that down. I might even do a. Filter blur, Gaussian, blur. Hi Yes Sam and you're right I am. I am from the USI moved to the Netherlands about two years ago. I'm from well from the East Coast. I was born in the Northeast, but I've spent most of my life in Florida going to where I was raised. So you are correct. OK, so we've got our background. Now we can start with our. Portrait. So I'm going to start with a. Flat color, just like blocking where she's going to be. I felt color dynamics on. I think I'll turn that of- little wild for painting. So it could be cool, but I'm going to just two colors myself. So if you guys were here for the first 2 portraits, you already know that the beginning stages are a little. Kind of rough and they go from it goes from. More abstract towards. More clean finish as we go, so we use. Don't be alarmed. At the blobs this is just beginning. Right? Just got up burgundy colored dress. We just see a little bit of it. I really like the light reflecting on her skin. There's like a coolish light over here. So I'm going to add the highlights. Next, I kind of. I generally work. Like Midtones first, then shadows and highlights. So. I'm going to pay more attention to the shape of the head, 'cause then the last painting. That's something that I had to do like a last moment. Edit of so. A little bit more attention to this. Alright, let's get the hair shape. Blocked in, which is blocking in basics. So. We've got this shape. Comes across the forehead and then back here. And then we can add the. The rap. I really like how we can see the planes of the face pretty clearly. I hope I can. Do good job with that in my painting. So for example. On the left. We have a little bit of warmth. To the skin and then from the front. Um, see. Yeah, this so basically when you're drawing portraits this side of the phase, the front this side you can kind of follow this sort of Ridge down here as that's what I'm looking at. Right here is that Ridge. From her cheekbone going down the chins really catching alight. Is very pretty. I might be going a little overboard with it, but. I'm just going to start out. Strong I guess. With the lighting, hopefully it'll help. Um? Eyebrows, so I'm just kind of working right now to paint in the big landmarks of the face and. I'm trying to go big big to small with shapes and. Paint in things that will help me. With the relationships like once you find where the eyebrows go, then you kind of start working on the placement of other things. My browser was one of the first things that I try to figure out. Hi arrow. I'm sorry that I can only read English, but. If you want to ask something, you're welcome to try Google Translate. Hopefully I can help you. Alright, so let's bring in that cold light on the shoulder. I wonder if I Blair that if it gives me like a muddy color, hopefully not seems OK. Actually, I'm kind of looking forward to painting with gold details to on her jewelry. Things that could be fun. Shiny things that are pretty fun to paint. All thank you O. Popping in and out as I work well. Welcome back. Thanks for popping back in. Hope your work is going well. Nostrils are another thing, Speaking of landmarks on the face and lips, of course. A lot of times I feel like I could just kind of. Take a stab at it and then rearrange things as needed. I probably could. Take a more structured approach to painting the face. For example, there's all kinds of methods to how to paint. Sketch out the face structure, for example, like the Loomis method, things like that. And as a really good things to study. But I found for this workflow I kind of like to just paint in shape, so I'm not using a sketch, just kind of painting. So there's a bit of trial and error moving things around. Gordon, I am using a centriq welcome centriq but I I'm using my keyboard for shortcuts, so that's what you're hearing. Your not crazy. I'm clicking a lot on my keyboard. I use my keyboard to do all the changing size of the brush, zooming in, zooming out. Color picking all that kind of stuff. All right, so we're going through the. Demon save of the portrait. Let's quickly go on to add the. But ours from peoples. Yeah, I notice I have tried. You have this tendency to make chins like too small or something. I hated that on the last painting too. All right, so we've got we started to get everything at least existing in the painting. As far as like facial features. So now we can go on and improve them, but. Just getting things in there is like the most important first step. I try to. Work on not getting too detailed with any one feature. Until I got everything blocked in. So from this angle, so you know what it's also because of the scarf. Like the rap she's wearing, it's kind of covering her ear, 'cause like wait a second. We can see the bottom of the ear and that's it. So let's put that into. OK, so let's start with shading. I think that the smoothness of her skin is really going to lean itself well to airbrushing. Like I've been using these hard. Edge brush is a lot an I think I will for details on this but I just feel like the airbrush might work really well. I will thank you if you guys if anybody. Because want to practice your painting with us. You're welcome to join in. So I'm going to make a new layer and create a clipping mask on to the current painting so long way to go. Try. Overlay, I'm not sure how this is going to work. As to read. Maybe that's not the way. Let's go on a normal layer. And just paint. So we're going to choose. Some later colors for the highlights. On the skin. And just paint in smooth. I'm in a little bit more. So a lighter warmer color on the cheeks up here. I'm just holding alt for the color Picker. Let's go a little bit warmer around the nose too. If you're having trouble picking the color, So what I like to do is I like to try to guess the color for myself, but if I really struggle, you could just color pick and see what the real color is and then test see how far that off that is from what you had, 'cause I think I'm pretty far off right now. And then you can at least figure out like where your tendencies where did I go too? Too dark to light, you know, whatever it might be. So let's try a layer on multiply for shadows will start getting some dimension in with shadows and we can do highlights. So I'm going to do. The right side of the face if you see on the reference the right side of the face and the neck are in shadow. And we can do a little soft shadow under the I like brow and. Yeah. Have to go, definitely gonna watch the whole video later. Thank you. Thanks Sam and I hope you have a great day and I'll see you in the video. All right, so here we go with the layering. Hopefully each layer will get a little closer, so it should be. Looking like. Got a lot of different hues and the skin. The side of her face, let me flip some like the reference again, the left side of her face is a little bit more of a warmish light, is like a. Almost greenish yellowish tone to the lighting on her skin and then on the right there's a blueish purple lace, so I think it's pretty cool. And she actually does have a little bit of smile, which is nice. I kept trying to give my other portraits today, smile. And we're going to give a little bit of warm pink color to the lips. On the bottom. Got some really pretty highlights here. I don't know if I should save it for later to do the Glossiness. I usually like to do like shiny glossy things, kind of like the final layer. Because usually that stuff is like on top of everything. Like you kind of paint the lips 1st and then put the glossy effect on top. You don't have to do it that way. OK, I'm going to up the brightness and contrast on her. Must try smudge brush. I did the same thing on the first portrait today. Both of them had had a lot of shadow effect and I think I like overestimated how dark I should begin. Alright, let's slip. So I'm switching between the Airbrush and the soft edge brush. You can download it. There's a link below the stream in the description. It's called soft shading and blending, and I really like this brush for portraits and things, so I'm switching between that brush and the airbrush right now. To do the. The rendering them doing. Just trying to find that happy place where she has soft. Soft skin, but you want some hard edges. So I'm going to go work on the eyes a little bit on the left side, the light is hitting her is making the. I really bright with the white of the eye is very illuminated. And in the left side, not quite as much. Oh oh, I'm sorry bout that pablos. Oh, but the link. OK, I'll update the number. Thank you. That was a typo, but at least the link is. The railing. That's the most important thing. Thank you for finding that. I like the gold eye shadow. Let's put that in. So it goes into the eye and then a little bit in the corner. Flipping their flipping the Kansas more than ever right now trying to figure out these. Proportions Alright, let's work on eyebrow. And everyone that we painted today had like very perfect eyebrows. It seems to be a theme of the day. So her lips are like not really parted, but just lately. Maybe the timing is a bit. Chinese tiniest bit. Portrait looks more difficult in the last. I think the lighting in this one is more difficult. This portrait and the first one, the lighting, is real was real tricky, but will get there. Just still working on getting things sort of the right. The right colors blocked in and trying to give her. Shading about getting muddy colors. And yeah, this one is definitely. Definitely a little bit tougher, but will get there. I can always just color pic. Come and check my. Check my work that way. Another thing is turning to the reference into black and white and the. Painting the black way so her skin is going to have a lot more contrast. So right now the color that I have for her skin is like. Not light enough in the shiny areas and not dark enough in the shadow areas, so I need to work on the. Yeah, it's a little flat. We gotta work on that to make it make it more contrast. Supposed to do it. But if anybody is painting along, I hope it goes well. I hope you have fun. Proportions, OK, let's look at bringing down from the eye. So the center of the lip should come a little bit further out. Something like that. You get a little smile. Same on the left and down. That little better. So the edge of the lip should be out there more. Hey Darius, welcome. And I've been like to look like her. I guess we've only been working on this for a little bit, but hopefully we can get there. You got a little shine under the. The job. And got shine. Over here. Feel like we're just starting to breakthrough the ugly stage. We're just starting to make sense of it. Let's get that highlight on the nodes. I was going to like save it 'cause I like going highway class, but I think it's really going to help with the three dimensional. Look up the news. Man, it's such a good quality photo like you can even see the skin pores and everything. Click very, very crisp. I don't think I'm going to go that detailed though my painting. I'm not going to paint skin pores and stuff. Right, so we've got highlight here. Hum. Little more than news. And get a little highlight underneath the nodes. Under the nostril here. The corner of the. Nose over there. Yeah, the shininess on the skin really shows a lot of like angles. And same goes for like amount bounce light. There's a warm light here. So we see that that's an upward facing playing on the nose. There's a warm highlight over here. Mostly so lazy this morning. Well, I'm glad you're having a good day someday there somebody's got a lazy day. All right? Hey Diana, welcome. How are you? We're just getting started on another portrait we can do in portraits today. I'm like having trouble figuring out what color to use for the shine on the nose. Maybe should color pic and really find out what color it is? Let's see. All right, well, I guess that wasn't too far off what I had is a bit brighter. Feeling lazy energies run out. I was getting that little bit earlier today, but I'm doing good right now. You guys give me energy. I like this color I'm I'm just going to use that purple color for highlights. I like that. Right up the lip got a little highlight. I need to learn what the name for this area. Anatomy is like under the like this this path. There's lightning there. Looking great, all thank you, thank you. Doesn't cool, eyeliner will get to that question. Get sucked into make up stuff too soon. So on the corner of the mouse over here on the left. There's a little bit of. Clearly the darkest part is the corner, and that comes down here. Should get a monster and then feeds. Oh man, I don't drink energy drinks alot anymore, but when I did monster with like my go to. I drink a lot of monsters. When I was in college. Alright, so I gotta work on this, is something that I messed up in the last portrait was like the symmetry of the lips and the nose. Right now I'm struggling with that. I need to move the lip over. So it's centered under the nose. For some reason my lips were lined up a little bit to the left. Extreme sports extreme painting. Well, yes, where are we getting there? If anybody's painting, this one with me, I hope you have fun. So something interesting about the values. So like the. Relationship the. Proportions of shadows and highlights and things I feel like. The highlights on her nose. They feel they don't. I don't know. I don't feel like I fit in. They look like their painted on. I think that looks better toning that one shine down a little bit like in the reference. It's actually really intense, but in my painting it felt wrong. Maybe we need to just brighten and more contrast again. Let's try adjustment layers, so I'm going to press the little half circle icon on the bottom of my layers palette and let's try levels. I feel like there's just not enough contrast in the way of painted her an also her skin tone I think should be a little bit. I've added a little too much red, so let's go to maybe selective color. Go more science and like that it feels better. Yeah. Yeah, that's better. We're getting there. Movie The background can also have more contrast. Alright, so I'm going to zoom out for a little bit 'cause I think that will help me notice that bigger areas of mistakes and things. I wonder if I should just like paint her right into the background to like that's what I did on the painting right before this I just painted all kind of on one layer. Let's do it. Hopefully it's not a mistake. But the great thing is, now I can kind of paint whatever I want. I want to add details. The background I just paid them. If I want to then you know. Paint something with her. Then I can do it and it just doesn't matter what layer I'm on is all good. I'm sorry, Diana is not a good time of day for you to paint or dead time of night maybe. Alright, so I'm trying to figure out where this is going. No, I'm sorry. I know it's not quite the same painting along with the video, although you're welcome too if you ever want to, and you can always share European things with me. And, uh, in message or social media or something? But I know it's most fun to do it at the same time. Yeah I have a big time difference between. My family too. My. My parents with both on the East Coast and my sister lives on the West Coast US, so that's nine hours. But Intense. But We still managed to stay in touch. Alright, I really want to bring in this purple color purple shine. Into more areas of the portrait. I'm just going to use it as like the main highlight color. I think maybe get turned down a little bit, make it a little bit less saturated purple. But I really like it. There's some on her shoulder over here too. And we're also going to start with the jewelry. I don't want to wait till the end and suddenly have to paint that. I think could be a challenge. Oh, thank you faster. I'm so glad that we got through the beginning stages of this one. It's always like that first that first like 30 minutes or so of these is a really. I'm always like second guessing. My process is going to workout. Thank you, I'm glad we got. We got to do better. Weather please. Robertsons after choose the wrong time of day to do real art when the light is not as good, but it's on the moon is good for me I see. That's that's frustrating. I used to be like a night person. Well, I still kind of naturally midnight more of a night owl, but sort of force myself into. Being more of a morning person but. I know the feeling. I think I'm going to use the airbrush a little bit. Under her her eyebrow. That area, her eyelid and that whole area is very very smooth. Very well blended makeup. So I smooth out a little bit more. So I will turn the layer on and off to see if I like the update. I think its going OK. Sometimes I do something and then. Change my mind after I take another look at it. Alright, first on the nose we've got this bright highlight. The left awhile it comes down little lower than what I have and kind of meets up with other highlights. Just like the warm color highlight. To the left of that we have. Like a darker, warmer color. I'm asking. And to the left of that is another highlight and that really shows us where the edge of the noses. That's what I need to work on. So. Something like this? Like that's very intense. How I did it but. Thank you see what I mean. Erase that, make it a little bit more chill. Fantasy to my work on either Chrome book or an iPad. Scared to see what my heart will look like on a computer so I watch Mattie alot. After Here's the bad. Well, don't be scared, don't be scared. He just takes practice. I mean, I say don't be scared. I was a little scared earlier of my own painting so it happens. That's normal. Right, so I think we can see the nose shape a little bit better. Should write a Dino or an animal like an emu. That would be fun. We did. We did some animals recently ish. Were you here for that time when we did a Flamingo? It wasn't last dream but the stream before. I believe we did some animals. It was mostly birds, but we can do more. I like the animals. I will take your request into consideration for future streams. Animals have a lot of cool textures and things to work on, and they're fun to paint and a little bit more forgiving than humans. I think sometimes. Sometimes you don't notice the anatomy mistakes as much. An animal is a person. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Alright, so we do have a hard edge here, so under the nose there's a well in the left of knows. There's a highlight. And it kind of comes down like this. The lighting is blocked of.-. I'm looking again at the nose and the. Mouth another lining up here. Could make a selection of the mouth. And go layer new layer via copy or control J. This is like playing with moving that over a little bit, 'cause I really feel like I. I don't have this lining up properly yet. Like imagining coming down. And I also want to look at the chin. The angle of that. 'cause again I'm trying to click imagine as if there's a line. Coming down here, you know, and that everything is like. In order not quite there yet. OK, let's bring the highway on the chin. So we want the planes of the face to stand out. So we know which side of his face is the front and the sides. This lighting is making it very pronounced. So I want to take advantage of that. Do snake next time there's a whole lot of texture. All pitbulls, my sister is to propose. I should ask her for some pictures. But yeah, snakes, lizards, snakes, reptiles. They all have really crazy textures. Those would be good to practice because. I've painted after I've done studies with those types of animals in the past, and I always struggle with simplifying because there's just so much texture it's like. How do you? How do you paint it in like? Tone it down into something that you know. Looks like the right texture, but you don't sit there and spend like five years painting it. Hi Thiago, thank you, thank you very much. Waking up to the sound of random clicks, little keyboard, ASMR in the morning. Alright, let's do a little shine on the bottom lip too. Right, I think it's getting better. And shine on the. Alright, let's look in black and white is going to help me notice what needs to be still needs to be worked on. Um? Well, it's getting closer. Value Wise. The likeness isn't quite there, but. The values are getting a little bit better, so that's good. Let's keep going and will just improve it as we go. Hopefully it'll end up looking a little bit more like her. I'm going to add the jewelry before it gets too late, so. Figure that out proportionally. OK, so the necklace comes back here. It's a kind of a choker, like it's not. It's not super super tight, very cool. Oh that's awesome Darius. Good recommendation. So I just picked one color to begin. Up Block him in. The Gold. But this is going to be a multi step process. So we want to choose a darker color for the inside. If you ever want something to look shiny, it's important to be bold with the contrast you have to go dark shadows and bright highlights, and don't be afraid to put those things next to each other and be pretty stark about it. That will help you look shiny. So for example, we need to go pretty bright now. For the highlight part here. There's this cool texture to the necklace, it looks like. Um? We actually want to look closer at it. Almost like a rope, but it's like gold. OK. We're doing layer 1 highlights on the necklace. Golden reflects a lot of other colors. So there's a lot of green in the environment around this. So we can put some green reflections. You can put some warm skin color reflections. And we can also put a sort of a drop shadow below the. The necklace on her skin here. So that will make it look more like it's really sitting on her. Instead of randomly pasted on the scene. Roberts is apparently it's national insect week in the UK, so we are challenged to create a bug a day in any art form that's so cute. I never heard of it. Thank you for passing along. That's very cool. At this time of year is perfect for that. Or the insects seem to be out in full force right now. Yeah, I agree there is. I like the necklace. And the collarbone? It kind of rests on the collarbone here, so that it comes all the way down. Painting with Gouache in the summer is a huge pain really. What is it? Because the humidity. Haven't noticed any like major issues so far, but maybe it's partially 'cause I've been mostly painting in watercolor lately. Not doing as much quash. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Dana. Better than acrylic, so really. The only thing I notice is that my watercolors haven't really been ever drying. But I also I think the brand that I purchased watercolors from. They have honey in the. Colors so that helps to keep them moist. So that's part of the reason too. So I want her body to be less detailed and her face of course 'cause I want the focus to be on the face part of the portrait. But we can do a little bit down here just. To make it feel finished, at least or. Somewhat finished. Washing colored pencil crayons so far and tend to make a stick insect out of fix. That's cool. I can't wait for it to be. Prime butterfly time. Over here we've got a Buddha Leah Butterfly Bush in our garden and it's not. It's not blooming quite yet, but it's getting ready. It's been. Thinking really a lot bigger. And I can't wait 'cause every year there's tons of butterflies is a pretty big Bush. You know before it to that. Alright, starting to look a little bit more like her I'm happy, got ways to go when I'm working on the eyebrows, eyebrows or like really important for likeness. I want to get that nice like fade between the two eyebrows in the middle, so I'm going to give her a unibrow, and then will paint out the center. That's my new technique here. If it works. Yeah, it's alright. To go, but it might come back. What time does this end? Oumm actually wow? Only 36 minutes. This is sort of counting down to the end here this timer. I might go a little bit longer if I feel like the painting is not done then, but it won't be much longer. That's going to kind of take us to the end here. I use liquefied. It kind of toned down. I was giving her really raised eyebrow. Hum. You know about that. what I just did get rid of that layer please. That's why sometimes I end up going back and removing those layers. Oh yeah, we gotta add the earrings. Two very important. Let's go start with a darker color. Gold And then we see it just like a little peek over here. Of the earrings. All right, and then, let's get the highlights and shadows and found flight and all that good stuff. I am definitely going to bring out the color Dodge. Great portrait Mattie. Never done one myself yet. Thank you. You're welcome to join us if you ever feeling feeling inspired to do so. Imagine being able to use liquify IRL. I would be very happy if that was a an option. Oh my gosh. Sometimes liquefy or transform tools like sometimes in traditional you just paint something real nice, but it's like a little bit. From a little bit needs to move over a tiny bit or whatever it's like, I gotta redo the whole thing. That's why I have really, really no shame in using the digital tools for what they're there for. I do not feel like being a purist about that. You know when I'm painting in traditional then. I can't do it. When is it? When I'm when I'm taking a digital, I'm going to use this stuff. I think it's great. Alright, let's flip. And put again. Alright, I want to put. This highlights late. Nothing were go brighter even. Um? Oh, Diana, I don't know if I answered your question earlier an but just in case. Like if you if it the stream cut out or anything, I'm probably going to be working on this for about 30 more minutes. Maybe an extra 10 or so after that if I need more time, but I was only scheduling myself about 30 more minutes to finish this, but like I think I kinda might need. Need a little extra time? We might add 10 or 15 minutes Max. But I hope will be able to see again. If not, have a great rest of your day. Thanks for hanging out with us. OK, so. Let's see. Oh, thank you Brandon. Thanks for saying that. Thanks for being here. I'm happy to share. If you guys have any requests like you're talking about the animals earlier, if you have any requests on anything you specifically would like to practice or. You know these studies of together you can let me know and I'll try to expose in mind for. For future things we can do here. Usually stuff I I've done so far has been portraits, landscapes, thanks, sort of basic things like that. You guys just let me know what you need help with or want to practice together. A Tesla, how you doing? OK, I think I went a little overboard with the blue highlight over here. No campaign over that. The background, I know this is like not about the plan, but I kind of want I put in some little. Highlights back here on the plants too. It's probably. Can of worms start painting the background right now? Alright, I do want there to be a lot of contrast. It's possible in some places between here in the background you can add some. Darker shadows here. So she pops out more. And I think I want to give her a little bit more eyeliner. She's got these. Wind winged eyeliner in the end flashes in the reference. And I think it looks really pretty. So let's do that. These eyelashes come out a little longer. And over here. There's a little wing. Something like that. That's better, we were missing a little bit of Glamour. Got home from work at midnight, no Tesla. I was thinking it was really late. I'm wondering what's going on. We're almost near the end of stream here. Sorry it'll work so late. I hope you're able to relax now. Contour in her right cheek is flawless. Oh my gosh, lives, thank you. Yeah, her her makeup is like flawless. I'm trying to like do adjust this over here. OK, let's duplicate the layer. I'm actually going to use the smudge brush too. Much out just get a little bit of a softer blend in a couple areas. 'cause she is real soft skin. I like the UM. You know I want some of the hard edges because I want to be able to. Read the planes of the face and all that. So this is a tricky thing her the shine seems to be like coming from below over here. Think of her eyes are a bit too big. That wouldn't surprise me. I tend to make characters eyes way too big. If if I am going to have a tendency one way or the other. It's 'cause of my. My anime background. Like when I was a kid and I started drawing, it was mostly anime characters and stuff and I kind of ingrained drawing big eyes and. It's still still happens to this day. Had to make the eyes little too big. I do paint more in a generally more like a semi realism kind of style, so sometimes you can get away with that. And also isn't really making the Winsor and Newton Gouache so far. I need to get an opaque yellow though. I think I had that trouble too with one of my yellows. I had to add weight to it. Alright, I think I. I think it's a little bit better. The highlight. Yeah, this is the part that's confusing me. I'm going to do a new layer if I'm going to like really exaggerate the shape, there's a highlight. That like comes in this area. Here I'll do it so it matches the reference. It comes like this. Because all the way down here. If I'm going to like over exaggerated, there's a highlight doing something like that, but it's not obviously so intense. Maybe else might use this much brush and then kind of like tone it down. Something like that. Um, Tesla says spent six hours unpaid overtime loading a truck, which needs to meet a crane in nine hours. That takes 3.5 hours drive to get to you. My driver will get 3.5 hours. If he's lucky I'll get for cash flow. That doesn't sound safe. Cheers. I'm sorry. So like. This is an rate. I hope you're able to get some rest and. Yeah, people shouldn't be driving under those conditions. Well thanks Pavlos, no worries no. I appreciate feedback, I'm not don't worry at all. Just trying to. Trying to adjust things, I think we're getting there get a little better. And a root. Who is cool? Yeah, I watched a lot of Sailor Moon. There's a whole bunch of the whole bunch. Looking good, thanks Darius. Thank you. Alright, well I spent so much time on the space but I can do anything with her. All right, without work on the hair. Oh well, please relax. Try not to worry about anything. Work stuff now. Hope you have a good evening. Alright, so let's get this nice blue purple bounce light in the hair. I'm going to try to do the same thing I've been doing with working vague too specific, so I'm going to first start just block in like some areas that have the light on the hair as if it's like 1 big shape and then I'm going to go back in and pay it more individual little shapes to give texture. Thank you bro. So I'm not going to get too detailed, but we're just going to do little girls little squiggle shapes. In here. I wonder if I'm using the wrong brush for this, but we're just going to start it and see where we go. So we don't have to really do too much. We just have to show little curls right where it overlaps the. The red part where you can actually see the texture. No. Right, Liz, I'm really happy like the reference picture. I did some hunting on flexibles unsplash, try to find some nice images to see for portraits and this wasn't my favorite ones. Shiny dot sorry. You want the shining dots. I know they do look cool. So that's something like for the sake of time we could. We could technically skip the Shinies Polka dot pattern on her. Um? Mike Scarff things is wearing. But I do think it looks nice. Let's try it. From my experience, I think. One thing that I wanted, I want to be careful about is not trying to make the pattern like mathematically perfect with the dots, but just kind of drop in some some jobs you know. And that makes sense. I'm going to maybe try different brush for this, though I think this one might be a little difficult. Let's try something like this. So I'm not taking any regard for. Cheating right now I'm just putting in dot shapes. I'm doing this on its own layer, so we're going to go back in and do like a shiny in the shadows and stuff. On its own layer. The few blue brushstrokes completely changed the hair. That's one thing that's really nice about painting like dark hair is. You can kind of just like. Paint a few highlights and it does a lot. I find that like blonde hair is probably the most difficult for me to pages from experience. I really like having red hair too. Like I think of red hair is a somewhat more like rare hair color, but I've painted probably. And I want to say more red hair that other, but it's very high up there about how many red haired people can do. It's just really fun color. Ha ha ha. I appreciate your enthusiasm. Alright, I think were almost ready to go into the next step, so this is an zone layer I'm going to lock the layer, press little checkerboard icon here, and let's go back to the Airbrush. Hey Andy, I hope you're having a good day or doing portraits. I can show real quick the portraits we've done today. If you want to see or anyone just coming in. This was the first one. And. See, this is the second one. And then we're working on this one right now. Man, this one was when I was starting it. This was my least favorite. Now might be my favorite. I'm starting to like. Had a rough beginning but. Thank you faster. Thank you so much. So there's a lot of reflection of the green environment on the. The goal details. And whenever there's like a little bend. Um? I'll give a reflection. Great here. It'll be a little bit brighter. Maybe on the top? Yeah it would be really great. Yeah, so I think that's like the easiest way to paint those. We can make give some a little bit darker shadow. Thanks Andy. Thank you. Yeah, it's been pretty fun day. Alright, well let's keep going. I have the sharper brush selected right now, so while I have this brush I can do a little bit more little flyaway hairs and things like that. I don't wanna go too much with it because. I think it's I don't know. It's nice for it to be soft. And I think if I start being too many sharp details then RI is going to be attracted more towards the hair then the phase. So there be careful. Is that? Thanks, thanks Robert. Like this one to Andy. Thank you. Yeah, it had been a while since I did any portraits. I've been going so much into landscapes lately. But I'm really glad we started doing the art club portrait topics for the kind of like slowly got me more in the mood to do portraits again. And I'm really enjoying it. All right, the. Um? This area needs work the. Under her hair on the. Forehead. Normal shadow over here. Yeah, there should be a little bit of like a for lack of a better word like a drop shadow. Should be a little bit of a shadow regret under her. Her hair. Make it look like. It makes sense with the lighting. The rest of the scene. That's better. OK, I think we can make this a little sharper too, so I'm looking at how close this is a really common mistake for me to make. Um? The The way that her this scarf he's wearing it should come closer to her eyebrow. Like there's too much space there. So let's leave. That should be a pretty easy fix. I can just bring this down. Thank you, thank you Tesla. I appreciate that yeah. Is definitely helped. Whoops OK, so yeah, that's wrapping up a little bit closer to her face now. Although I probably should add little polka dots to that area that I just added two. So we'll get to it. Will get to it. It's not the most important thing. Yeah, I want to look at the edges on. Pay attention to the edges. I might kind of blur out some. I'm bigger fan of like last edges and portraits and I think it can be cool in this one. So do you think it's much brush? Much pressure really makes me feel like I'm just using finger paint or something. Oh, let's try a color Dodge layer. This might be too much, but I was thinking earlier I really wanted to do color Dodge on the metallic details, so let's try it out. OK, that was really green. Not fun. Highlights So it's called the necklace. The key is you gotta pick like a small area and add highlight to it. If you add highlights everywhere then it doesn't really look shiny anymore. Just looks. I don't know it kind of loses the effect to take a couple places. Go kind of intense in those couple of places. Wonder if we can use this anywhere on her skin to get? I don't over do it too much. But Sometimes just a tiny bit his. Right? Alright, so let's just. Go with a toned down version of that. Gotta go great. Work today with the portraits. Thanks for the streaming, thanks Jackson. Thank you very much and thanks for hanging out. Define stream. Enjoy the rest of your day. Probably work on the work on the anatomy here a little bit more the. Color bone. I thought that was very pretty area of Anatomy. Used to puzzle me a lot, though I used to. Like to draw along her all the time to try to cover up this area was like hell. Checking to see if I'm going the right direction here think it's OK? So now what I want to do is just take some time to try to. Simplify. The sum of the. Like go over some areas that looks like I may be. Got too picky with the shapes and try to simplify them, like for example. Under the eye here, I think it should be more of like a triangular shadow. See if I can get that. I tried in a really like the soft shading and blending brush, nice. I love it. I love it. It's like I don't know. I know that it's not all about the brush, but sometimes it's really like great to find the right tool for the type of Workflow you want to use. And that brushes really really helps you find a happy place with my portraits, 'cause I feel like it's it's great for going. You know, starting with big shapes and getting more specific. 'cause you can get these nice soft angled shapes at the beginning. It was some more. Shadow is going on in the background here. So it looks like it's like a blurred out forest or something. Oh, by the way, I just notice what time it is. Don't know if anybody was painting along on this one, but if you were I wanted to give like a little warning that we have about. 6 minutes and 12 seconds. Yeah, the timer here is how much longer I'm going to be working on this one, and so if you want a few minutes to upload your art anywhere, whether it's a work in progress or or finished one, you're welcome to share it. If you were working on this this study. Otherwise. You can always share it later in the discord or in a future stream. So normally I stream here every Wednesday. The next two Wednesdays I won't be here because I'm taking a little vacation. And well, actually 2 weeks is a good vacation, but I will not be streaming during that time, so. I'm going to be back right after that, so the first 2 weeks of July won't be here, but I still will be in my discord. We're still going to have the art club topic of portraits going on that whole time. There's a ton of portraits, references in the discord and you guys are welcome to continue working on those the whole time. And then we're going to do. Like look at everyone's work. When I get back. So that's the plan schedule. You know? I kind of don't like what I did with the. I preferred the. First version of her shoulder, so most arrays out what I did when I tried to update it. Better. I'll try painting something with it. Maybe one day. OK, no pressure. You know, sometimes it is. The brush is cool, but it doesn't. You know may not fit in your style your workflow, so you gotta decide. Whatever you like, no pressure to use music. That would just be silly. 100% matched misjudged how much time it would take. Definitely work in progress, Ryan, thank you for painting with me. Oh cool, Oh my gosh, I can't believe you tried this in pixels and actually it looks amazing. But holy cow? I mean I've had a tough time. With with a regular painting, so cool how you added the Sheen as like this checkering pattern. OK, check this out. This is from Ryan and the chat who's doing a? Doing a pixel art version man, this one must have been so tough. There's just an incredible amount of detail. The shininess on her skin? Like of the highlights around the lips and stuff. Super cool, I hope you finish it. If you if you have time. Ha ha ha ha. Let me add a couple more of these little. Details here. That's better. Yeah, if anybody else wants to upload your art, if you're if you're busy uploading, you're welcome to just let me know as well if you think it'll take a few minutes. I don't want to like cut off stream before you get a chance to share. If you want to so you can always let me know when the channel make sure to wait for you. I like the blue little blue shininess on the plants in the background, 'cause it's kind of gives some explanation also to the blue purple shine on her skin. There's some kind of lighting like this going on. Alright, I'm looking for any last little details I can add or change that might be better. Maybe the eyeliner or not. Island eye shadow here. Kinda go little Missy. Hello mother ship, thank you. Pink you happy like it? I'm have 30 more seconds. We're almost done and then I will show you the other paintings we did today too. It was a fun, fun day of portraits. I definitely want to do some more of these. Lily, thank you. Yeah, I guess we'll call it here. 3210 OK. So. Here are my paintings of the day. This is the third one. I can show you the first one here. And the. Second one. Yeah, absolutely populous. It's a beautiful. All the reference photos were really nice. If you guys want to check out the original photos, you can look in the description and find the links to the posts on pixels and unsplash. So if you want to check out the original photographers work. You can. But those were paintings of the day, so about an hour and a half to this one was actually from yesterday. I had this one open because I was showing it earlier, so this was not part of today, but this was something else. But yeah, thank you for looking you guys. Thanks for being here. I really enjoyed this. Thank you clever. Thank you Ryan. Thanks everybody. Yeah today was a nice relaxing stream. I appreciate you guys hanging out with me and painting along and all the feedback in our chat. I hope you guys enjoy the rest of your day. I won't be here the next two Wednesdays, but that's sort of an exception. Taking some time off, but after that will be back to the regular Wednesday Wednesday schedule. Thank you Alan. Thank you, I designer. There should be a panicky alarm when the timer reaches 0. I'm thinking about adding some kind of. Requesting some kind of. Noise on there my my boyfriend is working on creating that plugin for the timer. Thanks you guys. Thank you mother ship. Well if you want to keep in touch in between now and the next stream my Instagram and discord server link are below the below the stream in the description so you can find me there. Otherwise I will see you back here in a few weeks. I hope you all take care. Love you guys and I will. Yeah I will see you I will see you next time or see you in the discord. Thanks again, take care and I'll see you guys soon.

Sorry for the issues, were having some trouble getting connected to the server, but hopefully we're going to stay connected. Now I'm going to try this is I know it's a little tough to watch the stream like this, but we're going to try our best to get some time to hang out together. An yeah if it shuts down again then maybe I will take a break for the day. Maybe I'll try streaming again and a few hours but I think. Yeah, but I'm going to try to do is will go through now and hopefully be able to continue smoothly. But if it shuts down I will probably stay stay offline. And if you want to hear any updates about if I'll be going live again or not, you can check my Twitter or my discord. The link to my discord should be in the the description. Below the stream and so you can keep in touch there about when I'll be going live. Um? Hey, I cash it's I'm having trouble connecting. There's some issues going on with the I think might be issues going on with the hand server. Everything seems OK with My Internet but you never know there's a lot of variables so sometimes these things happen. It's live stream problems. It happens, but no we were not purposely ending the stream here. This is not supposed to be happening. Yeah, so let's continue with the painting and hopefully will get through it again if I if I do shut down again, I'm probably going to end it there. And you can check out my socials for updates on if we're going to be streaming again later today or not, and otherwise otherwise, we'll just. We'll just call it for the day. I know it's hard for everyone to watch like this, so. Um? I do. I do also stream on Twitch Cornell. Actually I stream here and be hands every Wednesday and I stream some other days on Twitch. I also stream traditional art so. Yeah. Alright, let's get back into it. If anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well and I hope your hope you're enjoying your painting. So. Let's see where were we? We're working on for me what I'm doing right now is working on values, so I turned my painting into black and white and took a peek there an so that gave me some hints on what I need to work on. Also down here at the where the garden and the dirt kind of meets up. I want a little bit more of a gradual. Thing going on down there like I want to add some little little patches of dirt or little patches of shadow. It just seems right now. Is it? Abrupt end? So we'll try to get this one spruced up, so I'm adding some shadows shadows under the. Under the Bush is shadows under the stairway. Bring in some of the darker values finally. There is also a rail I'll do this on another layer. There's a railing. It's also really bright nice. Bright light hitting there. And so this is all on its own layer, so it's nice 'cause we can apply either a clipping mask or we can use a lock transparency. So I'm going to go to the checkerboard icon, press that down, and now I can paint any color that I want. I can make these this railing any color that I want, so I'm going to use a little bit of A. Um? Little bit of a shadow, a little bit of an off white color. Maybe a little bit towards blue. Might be pretty. Welcome back Anthony. Sorry about that, sorry about that. I'm glad you found your way back. OK, so we've got our stairway and it's casting a little bit of a shadow onto the. The stairs. And do something like this. Do you do? I think that's kind of cool. And then this meets up with the road. So if you guys have any questions about anything I'm doing, welcome to let me know. Going to flip the canvas over here and I'll flip my reference whenever I flip the canvas. I'm also flipping my reference on the other monitor. So it's really hard to do that without flipping. It's really hard to like. Just envision the reference flipped so I do flip it. I'm I'm not flipping, flipping the little thumbnail up top. But I am flipping the reference on my other monitor. So at this stage in the painting, I feel like we can get the idea. Now it starts to come together. The look that you get from this kind of Workflow. It's starting to starting to finally come together earlier on in the process. It's very messy with this whole sort of traditional style doing under painting, painting over it, having all that orange showing. Even now there's still a lot of orange showing that we got to tone down, but I think we're starting to get to the phase where you can see. Some of the benefits of it. We can see that it's. It's becoming cleaner and it has a nice look, but it takes it takes a little while. To get to this stage so you gotta like just have faith in the early stages that you're going to get here. Bring a brighter color green. Looking like individual leaves on this. This Bush here. More detail. Can turn on color dynamics a little bit more dramatic. We'll get some interesting colors and some lighter colors that look like light shining off the leaves. You can get pretty bright. You can put almost a white to show the idea of light shining off leaves 'cause they can be really reflective. And I see some warm color too in that Bush. Maybe it's Flowers, maybe it's little little twigs or some Brown leaves. I mean, I don't know, but it gives a nice variation. Alright, this little area needs a little bit of love. We've got shadows here. Purple shadows, that's where the. The mailbox is going to be oh you guys. At some point I accidentally merged down my sketch layer so the sketch is now a permanent part of the painting that wasn't on purpose, but Luckily I had my sketch layer at such a low opacity is it doesn't really make a difference. That's actually something that I do purposely when I'm painting portraits. When I'm painting portraits, I do like to merge my sketch layer onto the painting. So. That's an option of a workflow. Well, we're doing it here now. The other spin the image of an angle to make strokes or lines easier to draw. I do not I know that that's a really common thing to do an I got out of the habit of doing it. So part of the reason is before he started live streaming, I used to instead of live streaming. I would. I would record tutorial videos that kind of pre recorded process videos and one of the things that I notice, twas it would be really annoying to watch for people that were trying to watch the sped up video when the image was like moving around so much. You know what I mean when you're going to update it and stuff like that when you speed up. A video like that it gets really crazy, like in real time it's no problem, but when you speed it up it looks a little wild, so I used to. I so I got out of the habit of using that because of those videos making those videos and now I never do it anymore like I just never got out of the habit of it. I never think to do it for me. Flipping the canvas horizontally is like enough. I never need to turn it this way or that way. Ha ha. Ryan, the sketch layer that's so funny. It's no problem, though, you know. Average over the schedule later. Yes, please. Yeah, sketches now with us forever. Whether we like it or not, this Calculator is here to stay. Those are funny. That's the thing. Yeah so anyway. Got another pipe coming down here. You can use shift to make a straight line. Sometimes I have to do that 'cause I can't draw a straight line. Here we go. I really like using purple and shadows when it's a nice sunny day. Think it's really pretty. They've got a couple little say utility. Pipes and things. Random little box, some kind of meter. I kind of like drawing in these little details. I know that they're not always most aesthetic, but it overall gives an impression that somebody lives here, you know. Yeah. Alright, so. Let's bring some of these on a new layer, which I will not merge down yet, be careful. We're going to bring some of these. Wires here and there. On the roof. Different in Denison thicknesses of the wires. Some coming over here. Hum. And we'll have to decide if we want to include all of them. I mean, maybe it's a little bit much. Kind of a lot, actually. So I like the idea of making these two little closer together up at the top rather than having one of them actually cut down in front of the house. I think maybe that's a little bit nicer. So. Will do that. Oh, thank you. You are a like how you can make a pretty plainish reference into your really beautiful painting. Your colors and plants look very appealing. Thank you. That's really nice to hear. And we have to add the Flowers and still. So we have that to look forward to. Maybe I'll get into that now. Hey red welcome, sorry about that, welcome back. Welcome in. Let's add some Flowers that will be nice. So yeah, we can. One thing I'll do real quick before that is one of these wires up here. We actually get like a pretty strong light hitting the wire, so while that's on its own layer will come down like this. And add that highlight. I find those kind of things really satisfying and it makes. Makes the wire really feel 3D really pops out towards us without light hitting so. I think that. We could also get a. Pretty bright detail on top of the house here. Go to control Z for that perfect brush strokes. There we go. Alright, will merge those. And new layer for the Flowers. All right, these are going to be really pretty. We're going to really bright magenta, really bright. We might start with, yet we'll start with this color. And. Just paint little flower groups and almost looks unreal bright. But I mean, hey, that's what they look like. There's also some climbing up the wall here. I forgot to draw those little leaves will add them in. So that we can explain those Flowers, there's some down here. I don't know if they're all the same kind of plant, but these guys are everywhere. I love it. And up here tons of long now these are bit further away so you can kind of just make one brush stroke for a group of Flowers. And we're going to give some different variation of color too. I don't think it needs much 'cause they're really bright and kind of. Yeah, there's not too many different variations, but for example will go a little bit darker. Darker and cooler add some shadows so around the bigger groups or in the area where there's like a darker green we can imagine that there would be Flowers in shadow there so we can use this darker color. And then maybe we can make it brighter color. So color pic again from the original magenta and let's go a little bit brighter. Might be a stupid question. What kind of brush are using here for blending? Um, I'm not sure what I was doing when you ask me that question. If you're talking about the Flowers. I'm using a rectangle texture brush that I've made. The one that was what was I doing before? I'm not sure what I was doing. When you may have asked that. But You can let me know if I was painting a specific thing. I'll try to answer it, but I'm using these custom brushes that I've been working on that I will make available as soon as I can as soon as they're ready. I want to make a little tutorial video to go along with them so. It's taking a little time, but. They will be available soon. Try to remember what I was doing right before that. But yeah, I'm using a. There's a brush that similar to this one in the free brush back that you can download for me below the stream in the description it's called. It's called the rectangle texture brush. There's a very similar brush to this in that in that pack. If you're looking for something that will do the job, this will be very similar. So I'm going to select this group of Flowers here on the left. I don't know if my eyes are just. I don't know if I'm imagining this, but I feel like those Flowers are a little bit more towards red, like a little bit more towards red, orange and then these over here more magenta. I just seen that, so I'm going to. Q shift them a tiny bit. And I also want to add a brighter green. I feel like these Flowers are standing out as being like super super bright compared to the Bush. The color of the plant that they're coming out of. So I want to add some brighter green so I feel like the lighting makes more sense. But I am like concerned that those Flowers in the Bush I want them to match the rest of the painting. So you're gradually changing the colors to blend them in, yes, So what I'm doing is. If I'm trying to blend colors like let's say I want to blend from a darker green 2 liter green, then I will. You can do this with absolutely any brush, but what I'll do is you know kind of color pic from the color and then sort of overlap them and just kind of keep doing that because I'm using a brush with transfer so the brush isn't painting at 100%. It's going a little bit see through so when you overlap the brush with the colour it's going to give you, then sort of a mix of the two and then you can color pick that and put that over there and kind of. Keep overlapping them. This only works if your brushes has transfer. If you're using 100% opacity brush then you're just going to keep doing this and covering each other and that doesn't blend. But if you use transfer then you're going to be lightly overlapping the colors until you get a blend. So this is how I blend. If you want a really, really smooth blend, then you can use even softer brushes than what I'm doing. You can use a brush that's like a. An airbrush or something I used to use the airbrush alot for blending before I started getting into these textured looks. I used to use the airbrush constantly for that. And as it works really well. I see is the airbrush to block in to start with a blend and then I would go and paint on top. In add texture so that works too. So right now I'm adding a little bit more texture to the top of these Bush is. Yeah, you're welcome. No problem. So I want this feeling of dirt and dust and little tiny pebbles and stuff, so I'm using a brush with a lot of noisy texture. Where I feel that we're almost done with this one. There's a few more things that are missing that I want to get in. One is over on the right. Things are a bit messy and I want to paint in. The that there's a plant that I want to paint in. All these kinds of crazy leaves. So I want to get a new color green. Yeah, something bright like this, maybe not quite that bright. And. Paint some of these. I don't know what you would call this kind of plant. But Amazing how Flowers can bring so much life in a painting. It's true as sometimes I like to add little wild Flowers to scenes that don't originally have them. Who's to say where little Flowers can be? You can just add them where you want and it adds a little bit extra cheerfulness. Alright, I'm going to take a look at Reds link. Ended up drawing another one from yesterday. Stream, let's see. All Cute. This is a little sketch pen sketch from red Fox in the chat. Nicely done. I want to paint this one, maybe will do it in the upcoming. In an upcoming stream, maybe will do that one. Thank you, thank you for sharing. So I need to add some explanation for why these Flowers are just randomly up here. So let's. Let's work on having this little plant pop up behind the other one. With some leaves. Adding a couple more little cute little plants different. Circular kind of bushy shapes, and then you gotta plant. You can just make a little. Little sphere. At a later green on the top and you gotta push. Little sphere, little Dome. Add some later color on the top. We got a cute little Bush. I'm going to try again at that plant. I was trying to paint earlier. Wasn't really working. Let's try one more time, so we want these. He's kind of arched shapes. And they have light hitting, so some of them are brighter than others. Some of them come out higher up. And I think that gives a nice look to the garden overall, just a variety of types of plants. That's pretty cute. Yeah. Right, so we've got some overlap, so I'm bringing some darker green. And we'll go back with a lighter one more time. So depending on how detailed you want to get, we could go in and. Do more with those, but I think that's going to be fine. Maybe I'll put a little bit of shadow underneath. We could also put a little highlight on on some of the leaves. So leaves can be really shiny, so if you want to pick the area that's curved and add a little highlight that will make the leaf look shiny. Thanks, Red is strange now that I'm more afraid to do digital scenes than traditional. I wonder why, but it's so cool you're getting that comfortable with traditional. But I wonder why? Hey, just remember you can always make a new layer. It's not too scary. You can always change things. So one thing that I haven't really done yet in this scene is a mess with any. Layer blending modes or anything. But I still like to use those tools even when I'm going for a traditional look. I just usually most of the time I end up using them kind of around a bit the end as like a way to tweak things. Thank you, thank you Mail. Oh, I just remembered this one more plant that I've kind of excluded over here. We don't want to do that. Let's paint this little guy in. Little leaves here and there and then we've got more of an orangey kind of flower. I mean, I could definitely go overboard with these and just start adding like tons of Flowers of every color and different plants. You can really just go over the top, but. Try not to go too crazy. OK. So I'm going to merge everything down. If we're going to talk finishing touches and things. Loving the weighted pink Flowers and the bottom left thank you. Nice contrast you. Raffi, good to see you, thanks. Trying to see if there's anything else I should add in. I mean we could, like I said it's we could go on. We could go on with these plants but. For finishing things, what I usually do is go to my. Adjustment layers so that I'll be over here. On my layers palette oh have to start this again after I restarted. Whoops, there we go. Ah, OK, so. The. Adjustment layers you can go to little half circle icon and. Let's try. Let's try the levels. So this will be good for messing with values. We can see if we want the darker shadows to be darker. If we want the midtones to be lighter or darker, you can mess with all kinds of things can really change the mood of your painting. Do you want the? The lights to be brighter, so usually I'll come in here and a lot of times I end up adding a little bit of extra. Contrast. Sometimes will lower the Opacity gets a little too much. Yeah. Prefer digital, so I don't know what I'm feeling. This kind of like mistakes in traditional. Just don't look so off to me. Yeah, yeah, I know I know what you mean I've been. I've been going for like as you know, I've been going for more of this traditional looking my digital. Maybe it's something to do with that I don't know. I don't know. Now the other filters that I like to use or the other adjustment layers would be color balance. I like to go through these sliders from Shadows, Midtones and highlights, and sometimes I change nothing, but other times I do so you can see the mood, the difference in mood. If you want to go with more red or magenta and the shadows, you can make it feel like it's more in midday, or you can make it feel like it's almost sunset if you go with a really warm glow, there's so much you can do and really change or. Exaggerate the mood in your painting. Whatever you were going for, so. I like to go through this sometimes if I feel like I'm stuck even halfway through a painting. If I feel like I'm not getting the results I want, sometimes I'll come in here and mess with one of these adjustment layers and make some adjustments there and then continue with my painting. So sometimes it will help break me away from a from being stuck if I'm stuck. But let's let's take a look. What that looks like before an after, so I didn't really change a ton. It's a little bit warmer maybe. Do you have a favorite type of flower? Oh, that stuff. As tough. Yeah, my favorite type of flower dip paint is kind of the ones that we painted in this image. 'cause I just feel like there so fun and easy to just paint little dabs with your brush like dot dot dot and it looks like Flowers so I like painting Flowers from that perfect distance where you can just put a little paint stroke and it looks like a flower that's so like fun and easy to paint. These cheerful little Flowers so I like that, but my favorite type of flower might be a big fan of lavender. I have lavender in my garden. It's not. Really time for it quite yet, but I love how it looks at how it smells and all the bees and butterflies that come. So lavender is probably my favorite. I had to choose one. So I also like selective color. Selective color is kind of similar to the color balance, only it's even more powerful. You can select the individual colors here and then within that color range you can decide to you know, for example, within the Reds in the scene, I can go more or less cyan within those red, so you can really boost up your colors, change the moods, same kind of thing is I was saying before but you can edit your painting quite a lot through these through the selective color you can really change things without going in and repainting. Stuff is really powerful so. This can help a lot in getting the right colors in the right mood. If you feel like you're not having good luck picking your colors right off the bat and having them be exactly what you're imagining, you can try selective color to modify what you've got. And yeah, I really like it. So I don't always go through all these sliders, but sometimes I will. Sometimes I'll just go through all the colors and see if I can see if I find any, discover anything cool, and then I always look at the before and after. Make sure I like it, 'cause sometimes sometimes I end up liking the original better and sometimes I'll turn the painting to black and white and do like a value comparison and make sure I'm not doing anything to funky. Value Wise, but if we do the before and after this is before this is after 4 after so it is a bit brighter. One thing that you can do is go and Mascouten area. One thing that you can do is go and Mascouten area. So I do like the extra bright NIS but I would like the bottom of the canvas to be darker. So I do like the extra bright NIS but I would like the bottom of the canvas to be darker. So what I'll do is choose a black, go to the mask, click on the mask and paint with black so that will get rid of the adjustment in that area. So what I'll do is choose a black, go to the mask, click on the mask and paint with black so that will get rid of the adjustment in that area. So you can bring it back in if you want by painting it in with white. So you can bring it back in if you want by painting it in with white. So this is a nice way to edit your painting in a non destructive manner, because these are you can go back and change these and take them away and it doesn't modify original painting, but I don't care about that right now so I'm going to merge them all down. So this is a nice way to edit your painting in a non destructive manner, because these are you can go back and change these and take them away and it doesn't modify original painting, but I don't care about that right now so I'm going to merge them all down. Yeah, I am actually a huge fan of the Witcher. Yeah, I am actually a huge fan of the Witcher. I played the. I played the. Games two and three and recently like over the Holidays I replayed the Witcher 3. Games two and three and recently like over the Holidays I replayed the Witcher 3. I kind of wish I did it now 'cause this would be a good time to replay it, but. I kind of wish I did it now 'cause this would be a good time to replay it, but. Yeah, I absolutely love. Yeah, I absolutely love. I've painted a couple screenshots from the game. I've painted a couple screenshots from the game. For this type of study, maybe will do, maybe will be more of that. For this type of study, maybe will do, maybe will be more of that. OK, let's move this back over here. OK, let's move this back over here. So the last thing I'll do is some sort of like manual adjustments and things. So the last thing I'll do is some sort of like manual adjustments and things. So for example. So for example. Make a new layer, put it on multiply. Make a new layer, put it on multiply. And choose let's just choose like a medium Gray. And choose let's just choose like a medium Gray. And that and then come through and decide where we might want things to be a little bit darker and just add that extra little bit of shadow work on the values. And that and then come through and decide where we might want things to be a little bit darker and just add that extra little bit of shadow work on the values. Little bit maybe in the background. Little bit maybe in the background. These these shadow should a bit darker. These these shadow should a bit darker. And then I'll make a new layer and kind of the opposite. And then I'll make a new layer and kind of the opposite. Put the layer on color Dodge. Put the layer on color Dodge. I like to double click the layer an uncheck the transparency shapes layer. I like to double click the layer an uncheck the transparency shapes layer. That will make the color Dodge behave just a little bit differently, and I kind of prefer it's a little bit more saturation. That will make the color Dodge behave just a little bit differently, and I kind of prefer it's a little bit more saturation. And it will lower the Opacity and just take a big airbrush and find some places where you imagine the light is hitting most strongly and just do a little lick dab of the airbrush there. And it will lower the Opacity and just take a big airbrush and find some places where you imagine the light is hitting most strongly and just do a little lick dab of the airbrush there. And. And. So before or after, if you feel like things are getting too over exposed, you can just lower the opacity a little bit. So before or after, if you feel like things are getting too over exposed, you can just lower the opacity a little bit. I'm going to go back to the shadow layer and. I'm going to go back to the shadow layer and. I have a little bit more shadow to this building. I have a little bit more shadow to this building. Thoughts on the Witcher? Thoughts on the Witcher?

But Yeah, Alright will merge that down. But Yeah, Alright will merge that down. So that was our first one. So that was our first one. I can zoom in so we can take a closer look. I can zoom in so we can take a closer look. So you see that the perspective is a little bit different than the reference. So you see that the perspective is a little bit different than the reference.

If I was going to spend more time on this, I'd probably work on the doors and window.

Yeah, I'm I have read a little bit of I read like half of the last wish and then I was actually going. I was moving at the time so I kind of ran out of time to read it and I never picked it back up again, but. I was moving at the time so I kind of ran out of time to read it and I never picked it back up again, but. Yeah, I could tell even from a little bit there there was a bit different, but yeah, that's what happens. My original introduction to this. The story was through the games, so even if it's not the 100% accurate, it still like this story that I have most of my heart, you know. Which character from the game do you prefer? And. Well, Geralt's, my favorite, but I was always on Team Triss. I have to admit the 3rd so I start. I played the second one first so I was kind of had a soft spot for Triss because she was more like the Main. Lady in that game and then yeah in the Witcher 3 I also got a little bit more. I like Jen too. I'm not like Anti one of them but I don't know. I kind of trees is kind of my favorite because of that. Yeah. OK guys, let's go on to the next one shall we? If anybody was painting along or sketching along and you want to share what you did, you're welcome too. If you need more time, that's cool, but whenever you want, you can post a link in the chat to your artwork. If you did a sketch of this, the next one we're going to do is right here. This is the reference, so it's going to be all natural one. No buildings, we can relax, play with colors. I think it's really cool. This effect is like blue effect. I know it's maybe a little bit overdone, but in this photo, but I don't care. I love it. Love it. OK so I'm going to share this reference above. The chat and info tab let me add it there. If you want the exact crop that I'm going to be using, if you want a 360 view that's already in the description below, stream, it's the second one, second link. All right, so we've got our little mini. View appear like that little smaller. And I will put this on the other monitor. Hey fish in good to see you, thank you thank you. Looks beautiful, Mattie might take alright. Let me check it out Jackson and thank you. All right? Your perspective is always like, so right on, this really feels like the more correct angle to the reference, then why I ended up with really solid Jackson. That's beautiful. Yeah guys, check this out. I also I like your composition more of a square. I'm definitely fat square composition. I think I'm going to go for that with the next one that we're doing. Yeah, I really really nice. Love the colors in these Flowers and some of those lost edges. We've got some crispness and some sort of blurred effect to those that's really satisfying. Yeah, this works well as like a focal point for me. Very pretty. Thank you for painting with me, Jackson and if anybody else wants to, you can grab the reference and paint along. So I'm moving over here. We're going to work on a little bit more of a square composition. The reference is a bit more elongated than what I have here, but I think I'm just going to work with this. And again, I'm going to try to do this in around an hour. We had some tech issues, so I feel like I'm a little bit behind on my schedule, but we're going to try to catch up here on this one, 'cause I think this one will have a little bit of a chance to do that because it's there's no buildings and crazy stuff. So fingers crossed, but let's start with the start with the sketch. Hi Sean. Thank you fish and I'm doing good. I'm doing good. About to paint. Some of my favorite settings for me. This kind of thing. A little pathway through the forest. This is like some of my favorite type of scene to paint. In the world, so I'm happy. So I like the feeling of it going away into the distance, so I want to make sure we have a pathway that begins very small and narrow and gets bigger coming towards us. And. Something like this? And then we've got next to that little bit of dirt. And then next to that and got all the plants. All the plants got a little bit of a higher ro of Bush is or trees here. Same thing on the other side. Oh no, you don't like painting leaves. Read says what makes me laugh is the community started by blaming the cast of Henry Cavill to play girl, then ended up putting him in God Stand 'cause he's good. Yeah, I guess people didn't think he could pull it off but he really did. He really did. He deserves all the praise. Haha right fish. Oh man yeah, it's good to see you guys. Thanks for being here. All right, so we're going to keep these these plants pretty soft and fluffy. And then we're going to have some stand out against the massive green and they have their own little more unique identities, so that's going to be this tree right here. The little arm reaching out like that. I've got some random ones. This tree over here actually let's do this one first, 'cause this one is in the foreground. Kind of overlaps the other. So like this, maybe we can even go out more of an extreme angle, so I'm going to select what I drew, go to edit, transform, skew so this will let me just tilt it like that. Super handy. Don't have to repaint anything. And. I used the transform tools a lot in my sketching. I'd like to sketch a perfect the first time, but it's not always the case. Got the other tree here matching up alright. And then on this side, we've got some unique plants too, so we've got one palm tree that comes up over here. Yeah, Yeah Ryan, he's someone that would be good to do. A portrait study of he's got very like strong facial features. That would be a good choice. All right, so we've got our palm tree with a sketch in roughly the area of the palm fronds will take up, so something like this. And then some other over here, so I'm just sketching in like the outline of where I want to paint these plants within. I'm not necessarily going to sketch the plants when we paid, the plants were going to make them look. More like the plant with leaves and stuff, but I'm just trying to get a feel for where their placements going to be. Over here we've got some branches kind of coming in from the side more close up to us, so we've got these big leaves that's going to be nice. Yeah, OK, so I tried to fit this in. The reference has a little bit of different of a composition than what I've done here, so I'm trying to like. Make that work. I think it's. I think it's good. So will merge everything together. Bring that pulled over like this. Think we're ready to go so there's one thing that I forgot that I did last time. It worked pretty well so I had merged this painting on the left over onto the background layer what I'm going to do is go to layer new layer via copy and put that on its own layer and just lock that layer so no matter what I'm not going to accidentally destroy this painting on the left so we can preserve it. Just to be safe. Hi, our age welcome and thank you. If you guys have any questions let me know. We're going to begin the new one right now. So see where is the best place to put this? Trying to show as much of my paintings possible? Alright new layer and what should we choose is an underpainting for this one. I wonder if we should go for a similar color, so I'm looking on the ground that warm colour maybe will go with something a little bit more pink. I've been trying to experiment with different underpainting colors, but I find that in a sunny environment I tend to use kind of the same thing over and over again, but seems to work for me. But let's go a little bit more pink. See if we could get more of a tropical feeling in this. So this is just so that we can start off with. We don't want a white background, we want something that's a little bit more midrange value wise, so something that's not too too dark or too light. And like we could go a little bit darker if we want to actually think through. What the value structure of the scene is going to look like? It's going to be something like this. All thank you foster. Welcome back, sorry about the tech things. I'm glad you like the results. Highclere welcome. Welcome welcome alright. So we've got our underpainting. Let's try to keep this one extra loose for the sake of. For the sake of time, and you know, playing with style, so will try to keep it loose. I'm going to take the sketch layer, put it on multiply mode, and lower the opacity. I'm going to take the sketch layer, put it on multiply mode, and lower the opacity. That will make it easier to see through, and I'm going to lock the layer at around 20% opacity somewhere around there, and then we're going to paint underneath that layer and just use it as a guide. That will make it easier to see through, and I'm going to lock the layer at around 20% opacity somewhere around there, and then we're going to paint underneath that layer and just use it as a guide.

Is that just because of what you feel like doing or do you sketch the harder ones? Is that just because of what you feel like doing or do you sketch the harder ones? Yes, good question. Yes, good question. I absolutely do that. I absolutely do that. Lock it down right? Lock it down right? Ryan lives will have any accidents already we had did that once today.

Alright, I will get a little bit of a gradient to this, but I want to get a tropical feeling so I'm going to focus on taking inspiration from the colors of the reference, but may be shifting it a little bit more to fit this kind of vibe.

Not necessarily. It depends on what works well for you, so it's only bad if you feel like. It depends on what works well for you, so it's only bad if you feel like. It's hurting your painting somehow. It's hurting your painting somehow. I think it's OK to do some sort of a compromise where you sketch a loose plan of things. Maybe you're not enjoying getting stuck in like a sort of a line art phase where you're like deciding every detail but just a rough sketch can be nice, just a little bit of just to plan out the basic composition and then go for it. Let's see, Ryan says, do you think you tend to like the outcome of onesie sketch over the ones you don't? Or can you not see the difference? I I wonder, actually I'm not sure. I I wonder if I went back and kind of assess them the results. I I don't know that there is one I prefer, I think that. When I don't sketch, it does have a chance to look more painterly, which is often something I'm going for. What I've noticed OK, so one thing I have noticed is if I don't sketch then the beginning part of the painting. Can look really, really really rough because sometimes I'll just try to start without any guidelines and things will be. Things will be not looking great. You know what I mean? And it takes awhile to work up to something that looks better. But oftentimes I do like the results. It looks more painterly, looks more more traditional ish, kind of. So you kind of have to. There's like that. Balance. A sketch really gives you something to go off of so that you're not like. Coming up with wild stuff, you know, like proportions of things for me. Realize there was a dog in the previous one. Yeah there was. I know what kind of cop down and didn't draw the dog. I really like the effect of the striping of the shadows going across. We can see the individual trees. Tree shapes. So let's get a lighter color for the sidewalk where it's getting hit by light. Not quite sure what color I want to go with. So that. But I want to start blocking in some of this. This is probably 1 where it's going to be important to look at the painting in black-and-white because there's a lot of tricky value things here. So for example, I want there to be highlights that come across the dirt, so they're going to be on the dirt and they're going to be on the. The path and they need to look. Similar in value when you look in black and white. But in the painting they need to make sense that the dirt highlights are going to be warmer. 'cause something Brown is being illuminated on the. The pathway is going to be cooler because something great is being illuminated, but it's still roughly the same amount of brightness. Is the goal something that might have worked really well for this is to just paint the just paint the thing and it's whatever shadow color, and then add use like color, Dodge or something like that to do the lighting that could have worked. Let me show another workflow and we'll see. Maybe I'll even use that instead. If it turns out really great. But so for example. For example, if I. Hum. Let's get that flat color for the pathway real quick and will get that in and I'll show you what I mean. OK, so we've got our pathway. Make a new layer. Hi thing welcome more than one dog. A whole herd. Yeah, if you turn the camera there's like 5 dogs. I don't know what's happening but they're having a good time. Fish and if it was a fish I would have never left it up. OK, so let's try this so. So I'm putting this layer on multiply so. Here is what we get. Basically, a shadow that goes over and it will darken the purple to a darker purple. It'll darken the Brown to a darker Brown, so instead of me trying to figure that out, multiply is pretty nice here, so I might use a different brush. But I think this might be the way to go. Alright, so let's try it. And we're going to do the same thing as we're doing right here. With multiply. We're going to do this with color Dodge to add highlights. Yeah, and if you compare it with the other one, yeah, I'm more happy with it. We are going to brighten things up. But this is a good start. And you can even use this on the green to add shadow 2. So layer blending modes can be super Super Handy. For this kind of thing. And we can shift the color a little bit more towards blue or green if you want for continuing up onto the foliage and adding some shadows. That color will make a little bit more sense there. Yeah, I will merge that down. And then make a new layer. That does make me feel better, yes. And let's try color Dodge, so make a new layer, put it on call Dodge. I'll double click the layer and uncheck transparency shapes layer. And then let's. Pick a nice bright peachy color and look at that. That's pretty cool, pretty cool effects. It's a bit overexposed, but you can always lower the Opacity a little bit, but I think it works so well for this. So then we're just gonna drop in some. Some highlights. And you can go right across. The pathway you go across the pathway an across the dirt. And apply the same color everywhere so it is intense. Maybe right? Maybe I should turn that back on transparency shapes layer may be a little too intense. With that on. But so this is just a first pass at. This will be able to go back in here and paint without the color. Dodge just kind of paint normally after this, but I think this is working well to give us a starting point. Alright, so we still have the layer the sketch on another layer. Try not to merge that again. OK, so now I will go back to a brush I was using at the beginning. Just like a texture textured brush and let's add some blue ish so more blueish bounce light onto the road. So these areas that are in shadow they're not super super dark and they are reflecting some really pretty blue light. So now that we have a starting point I'm going to try to paint on top of this and clean up some things. Get less muddy colors than what I have right now, hopefully that'll work. But if anybody's painting along with me, I hope. I hope you're enjoying it. This one seems a little tricky, but it's I think are really pretty scene, so hopefully hopefully you'll enjoy that. We can turn the painting into black and white to get a look at it and I would suggest turning the reference into black-and-white too, so this is really helpful to me. It shows me that I mean look at these shadows and highlights so the shadows and highlights are more important than the difference between the road and the dirt. Contrast Wise. As much as I absolutely love dappled light, and I like painting scenes that involve it, I do find it a little tricky. For the for exactly this kind of reason, the. The values the. The values in the colours and everything, they just it's so intense the difference. Between these highlighted areas on the shadows. But will get a nice glow. We just gotta go back and forth until it makes sense. I think just like with any painting. If you feel like 1 area really feels wrong, sometimes that has to do not just with that area but with the rest of the painting. Like there's a lot of I need to get a lot more darker values over in the. The foliage and that will help make it makes sense why there's this dark area on the ground right now. What I'm doing feels a little out of place because of that. So let's let's just merge what we have now so far is like a beginning. An will go to the Bush is on the side and add some more dark. Dark colors and hopefully that will help us to visualize. Overall, visualize the with the shadows should look like better. So down here. From this side and we can add in the trees too. So I've tried to get too stuck on one area. If you are like something that I have tried to remember as like, make sure the rest of the painting is working too. 'cause that might be part of why that one area is bugging you. It might have to do with the relationship between that area and other things, so like it really will make more sense when we get these trees in. Let's pick it dark Brown. I love the gradient. In the colour of these trees, so I'm doing them on during the trees on their own layer. So this is going to be easier to do that way. So paint the whole shape of the tree first, not worrying about anything to do with shading. Just do one thing at a time. So painting the shape of the tree. Oops, let me choose a texture brush for my eraser will be better. Alright, feeling in the whole shape and then it will lock the layer. Press little checkerboard icon here. And. Will get a nice purple blue at the top. 'cause look at the reference. We've got a beautiful glow from the Sky. Always enjoy it. When I paint along a bit of suffering. Well, I'm definitely feeling that right now. This one is tougher than I thought. OK, so we're going to put some bright lights hitting the tree also. So along with that cool balance late, we also have bright splash of this dappled light hitting the tree. Would be very scared to tackle reference like that. Yeah, I definitely felt pretty intimidated when I finally got down to it. I think I felt the scene was so pretty that I was not paying attention to anything else besides that this is beautiful. Then we go to paint it. How do we start? But it's really good for practice with simplification. Ha ha ha ha ha right. That's such a funny summary of what I said, but it's also true. Try reconsidering the whole painting is messed up. So true, though, like sometimes, you're stuck on one area. You're like. Why is this not working? Part of the reason it's not working is because of other areas. It's like if we don't. If we don't have anything that's casting the shadow yet, the shadow is going to look at wrong. We need to get the trees in and you know all that other jazz and then then it's like. OK now are shadows will make some sense hopefully. Yeah, that's true. Excellent quote. So I'm putting some purple balance light on the side of the tree over here, just highlighting on the bark. Hi Acer welcome. How are you? We are doing some virtual Pleinair Sketch Studies Painting Studies. If you want to see the reference, they're all below the stream in the description. Alright, so let's work on a another layer. For the other tree, so new layer and. Just fill this in back here. Hi welcome, thank you. If you guys have any questions just let me know. So while following these reference we need to create our own ambience. I mean images look dull, but the way you choose the color and lighting it all comes together well. Thank you. It depends on what your goals are with your practice. These kinds of studies you know you might have a specific goal, like maybe you want to work on getting the values like the shading to be accurate. So then you would focus on that. Or maybe you want to work on selecting accurate colors to the reference so you would do that. So it depends on what you need to work on what you choose to study. So for me. I'm I used to those used to be my main focus, and since I was able to improve on those things overtime, then I've shifted my. The goal of my studies to be something a little bit more like exploring my own style. Things like you're talking about, so I will take the reference and try to. Do a little bit more of my own thing with it. You know when it comes to. The mood and stuff like that. And so anyone I mean, of course, whatever you want to do is you're welcome to do. But my point is, if you're just getting into doing these types of studies, don't feel like you have to come in here and really change things from the reference. A law or go crazy like that. You know it's fine to just just paint the reference for practice as it is, and then as you do more and more of these studies, I think you'll slowly get comfortable changing things from the reference and putting your own spin on it. And some people might feel good doing that right off the bat, but for me when I started doing these I was like. Very much just repainting the reference really accurately. Are trying to. It's a matter of opinion. If it was accurate, but you know. Oh, thank you. Thank you Claire see, I'm glad you're seeing progress was nice to hear. Hi Mona, thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah, so for this one I decided that it might be nice. A nice contrast from the other reference we just did to take a little bit more of a tropical twist on this one, and it's leaning that way anyway. There's palm tree in the scene, but you know we can. Really put the colors more in that direction if you choose. Which is fun. Experiment with what makes that work. So there's an area of this branch that's getting hit by lights will put a bright. Pop of warm light back there. Maybe I'll switch brushes to something that's better for doing little little branches and things. We'll just get these in now while we're. We're working in this area. So a bunch of little branches. Well at some leaves and stuff next, I like to paint branches first. If I'm painting a tree where you actually see a lot of the branches, 'cause sometimes the trees really, really full and you see like a big blob of leaves. In those case I'll just go right for painting the groups. That leaves button it with a tree like this. I like to paint the branches first. And then paint that we use seems logical to me. Let's see Hi Mattie, I heard about UI UX designers stopping by your streams including me. Hi, welcome. Welcome, welcome well anyone is welcome to stop by. I don't have a lot of personal experience in the that kind of design. My boyfriend does. But You're welcome to you after meeting painting questions. I hope you're having a good day. Good to see you. Many artists just paint in what they see in a hyper realistic way. Yeah, Adele. That's well. That's some some artist like to paint that way always, and that's absolutely fine. If it's you know people have different tastes, so for me I kind of started of- more like that and then overtime, my tastes have changed and now I have different personal preferences and I like to explore more stylistic approach, but that definitely changed overtime. That wasn't always the case for me. Hey sour puss. This is so therapeutic thank you melody. That's really nice to hear. Was the hardest part in the process for me, probably. The what they call the ugly stage. Some paintings have it worse than others, but a lot of times when you're painting, you have to go through a period with your painting where it just looks awful like things aren't. You haven't figured things out yet or you just started blocking things in and you haven't balanced the shading yet. The values don't make sense, you know this just so common in most of the paintings that I do, there's going to be some phase where things just don't look good and you gotta just trust the process and power through that. That phase of the painting and then be able to finish it up. It's very, very normal, so I think that's the most difficult thing about painting is. Sticking with it through that all. Thank you sour puss. I'm glad you like the the format I'm enjoying this too. I had a lot of fun with it in the last stream, so that would be tried again. All right, we've got another tree up here. And it kind of disappears into the foliage. Let's see. Gotta walk my baby needs for an hour which is amazing. Oh that sounds sweet sour puss. That's really nice. Getting out of the doors these days is a celebration. Yeah, it really is. It's actually looking kinda nice outside. Now is pretty gloomy yesterday and most of today, but now we're getting some sun. Little bit of sun peeking through the clouds. Trying to figure out what to do with the palm tree here. Yeah, I think I'm just going to sketch the Frans on the layer below. What I'm working on right now. I think that will be. Easier. And then will merge the layers. So I'm going to try to keep this. Loose. So I'm not going to get 222 detailed with the palm tree. Kind of trying to remind myself that right now I like painting palm trees so I can easily get sucked in. Will add some little some little of these individual leaves. Also, sometimes when painting organic things that can be fun to take a brush, a textured brush as your eraser, and erase back up into the shape that you created. So having a cool shape of your eraser you can add details that way to buy, like subtracting from the shape. That's so cute surplus. This is four months old and has the cheeks of a hamster ready to hibernate. Oh Sounds adorable. Alright, so we got a pretty good palm tree block in. I'm going to lock the layer and do the same thing. What we've been doing and pick a let's pick a bright blue. And add a little bit of color to the. To the tree so this. Maybe we'll do it. The opposite will go all blue and then add green. So basically we're having a lot of their space between us in this palm tree and the Blue Sky Glow is sort of over like pouring over the palm tree and giving it this kind of glow effect in the in the photo. It's like very intense and I like it, so I'm going to keep keep it. Hi, very welcome. Steven says it always amazes me watching a painter work in seeming to be apparently blobbing paint onto the canvas. Then in the final five minutes a few strokes pulls off pull massive loves into a picture. It's funny, it's funny too. Sometimes it's really like a race at the end when I do these time studies. Sometimes I feel like it's not working for quite a long time and then just at the end. It's like Alright Starting to get there. Sometimes I have that feeling. I wish it was. I wish I wish I could see it more clearly and earlier sometimes. Gotta trust the blobs. Yeah yeah, I I. I grew up in Florida so I'm very familiar with palm trees. They always give me a good feeling, nostalgic kind of feeling. Group in South Florida. So we were always surrounded by Palm's. One thing I don't like is that I ended up making these. Up Frans kind of equidistant from each other. I want them to feel more random, so I'm going to add a little bit of space. In between. Ha ha ha. Alright will be will have to be satisfied with that. For now the palm tree, but I might come back and work on it later. So this was a sketch from earlier I was starting to try to fill in these darker areas. Normally, like how that looks will raise out a bit of it and just go from there. Right, but we are starting to make more sense here. It is starting. I have some see I have some brushes that have sort of a leafy texture which might come in handy here. I was because I've been going for this traditional look. I've been trying to paint everything and not rely a ton on stamp brushes with this particular style, but. When it comes to leaves then I can make an exception. I love using. Leave brushes are kind of fun for you to stamp in. I'm gonna try to work them into my painting in a way that feels natural. So as the plants are getting further and further away from us, they're also getting a little bit more pale. No, thank you. Hi Jennifer, welcome I hope you got a good rest. So let's get a little bit more of a green green. We've got a lot of Blue, Green, need some green green. Can you recommend a good welcome tablet to work on? So I'm using the Wakeham Centriq 22. If you are looking I love this tablet, but if you're looking for something in a little bit more of A. Like depending on your budget. In a lower price range, the Intuos tablets are really good. Um, I'll type that name in the chat so the interest line. I don't know about a specific one, 'cause I haven't really kept up with like what the latest models are, but I know a lot of professional artists that use those and they seem to last a long time and have good pressure sensitivity, so there are definitely an option. But the welcome is come out. The welcome brand has come out with a few different like more affordable screen tablets lately. So if you really want to get a welcome, you could look at the welcome one or maybe the 16. I think those are more reasonably priced screen tablets from them, but I really love my 22 so it kind of depends on your budget. Hey pro designer welcome. Now there's also other brands that make screen tablets. If you'd really like a screen tablet and check out some other options. So I'm not really like in love with the shape of these that I came up with over here. Then I will rework that a little bit. How long have you been painting for you make this look so easy. Thank you. Melody, I've been doing well. I've been doing art my whole life. Basically from when I was a kid. I love to draw and I always would always draw. But I got into digital painting about. Like 6 to 7 years ago, maybe like 6 1/2 years ago somewhere around there. So I've been doing digital for a long time. Doing these virtual Plein Air Studies during these times studies is one of the things that's helped me out the most in getting really comfortable and experimenting with different styles and things. So I started doing these maybe a year and a half to two years ago, and they've been like one of the most helpful things for me. I think I improved more in that time than I did in the time before, so I would definitely recommend doing these kind of studies if you're interested. All Ricardo I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah I haven't tried them out myself. I appreciate the feedback for chat. Sorry about that. I still have the palm tree on its own layer. What's actually on the same layer is the other trees, but I'm going to remove it, but on its own layer. The way I can kind of mess with the contrast and things. So I'm going to take the lasso tool to help with some of these close-up leaves. I actually love this technique. So I'm excited to show you it's a simple idea, but basically just taking the lasso tool and sort of drawing with it so you select a leaf shape and then hold shift and then make another leaf shape. And so they're pretty basic shapes. Nothing too fancy. And you could just select a bunch like this. And fill that in with either solid color or something with texture if you want. And then while it's still selected, you could give a little bit of a gradient or texture or something. Make it more interesting, and then deselect it, and you've got a bunch of leaves and then make a new layer an. I'll probably do a couple different layers of this is it's not necessarily you need things to overlap when you're doing this kind of stuff, you need to overlap for to look more natural. So probably take me a couple layers to be satisfied, but. Well, at another group believes. Um? Can you have a leave a link to your fabulous looking chair chairs manufacturer site? Although I can guess it's expensive curiosity, I don't have a link handy, but let me type the chair model in the chat for you and I'm sure just Google it. Going too far on this. Going too far on this. Can't too far. Can't too far. I think you'll be able to find it easily, but. It is the Noble chairs epic gaming chair and black. OK, I'm back sorry. OK, I'm back sorry. A lot of weird things going on. A lot of weird things going on. That's the that's The One I have. No, no problem. No, no problem. I think you'll be able to find it. Uh, yeah, I'm using this merging tool a bit. Uh, yeah, I'm using this merging tool a bit. I do enjoy this much tool. I do enjoy this much tool. I don't know if you've heard me talk about it a bit. I don't know if you've heard me talk about it a bit. All right? But I use it a lot. But I use it a lot. So will fill in the new leave shapes. I specifically like it for, well, I guess I use it with both brushes, but. I specifically like it for, well, I guess I use it with both brushes, but. You can add. Some brighter colors, not variation. I used a lot with. I used a lot with. You can decide which layer you want on top. This hard round brush. This hard round brush. I mean you can use it with any brush. I mean you can use it with any brush. You know I have this hard. You know I have this hard. We can also take another brush. Kind of rectangular 12. Kind of rectangular 12. But I feel like I can get some really quick. But I feel like I can get some really quick. And yeah, you're welcome at Keene. It's a good chair. I really like it. And convincing form. And convincing form. So just try to put my colors in a very bold way like that. So just try to put my colors in a very bold way like that. And we can add a like a stem, you know. So I can kind of spend my time selecting the colors in the saturation I want, like I can really find that color and then just put it down very definitively like that. So I can kind of spend my time selecting the colors in the saturation I want, like I can really find that color and then just put it down very definitively like that. We've got these floating leaves. You can get it really get away with them floating anyway, 'cause sometimes the stems can be covered up by other leaves. You don't necessarily see all this, but. Yeah, I can draw that in. And then I use the smudge tool to. And then I use the smudge tool to. Haha, this is an amazing portrait of a Tiger. Hiding a Tiger would look so good in this picture. I don't know why. I don't know why. Flag in as much as it is I can't do it too big like it's not good for big gradients, but it's good for like form like this so. Flag in as much as it is I can't do it too big like it's not good for big gradients, but it's good for like form like this so. It's good, good, good colors for a Tiger. Alright, one more layer of leaves and I think we could. If I want to. If I want to. I mean this quick and messy. I mean this quick and messy. Thank you, Pedro. Facts I can do that I really like it for skin. Facts I can do that I really like it for skin. Q. I want to make little ridges and bumps. I want to make little ridges and bumps. I can do that. I can do that. So if anything is bothering you about the other leaves, this might be time to use them to cover it up the additional ones. And it's much is smudge it as much or as little as I need to. And it's much is smudge it as much or as little as I need to. Thanks fishing all. Thank you Mona. Thank you. Well you guys are always welcome to join in if you like no pressure, but if you ever feeling inspired to, I always share the references that I use below the stream in the description and don't feel like you have to paint at this pace. Sort of reminds me of sunglasses. Sort of reminds me of sunglasses. Really you see sunglasses for them out. Really you see sunglasses for them out. That's strange. That's strange. I thought the eyes would read read pretty clearly. I thought the eyes would read read pretty clearly. You know I've been kind of working my way up to painting faster over the last couple of years with doing time studies, but you're still welcome to join in if you want. It's it's fun and we usually have a few people painting along. So. Just for practice, I find it's a little bit more fun to practice with other people. Sometimes it's hard to have the. I don't know the motivation to start it up. Sometimes so. We just do 4. We just do 4. Yeah, if you ever want to paint along with the stream, you guys are always welcome to do that and you can just post whatever you do, whether it's a little sketch or a more detailed painting. Maybe? Maybe? Whatever you have time for, you can post the results of that in the chat. Uh, we're like I always have trouble depicting the difference between foliage and leaves at a distance from the close ones, like how to give the bouquet effect? How should I deal with that? Um, depicting the difference between foliage and leaves at a distance from the close ones. OK, so there's a couple things you can do. For one, you can make as they're getting further away. Kind of like with what I did here. Make them lighter in value, so so actually lighter, more like there's hazy air between those plants. So for example, the further away plants what you can do is make them. Just watch the load baseball shows. Just watch the load baseball shows. Like I said, lighter. Sometimes you can have a more atmospheric color like add some blue. No problem. No problem. They can be more towards blue. The plants that are closer to you, they're going to be. And totally be worth it. And totally be worth it. The high fives. The high fives. Darker, they're going to be more the real color less of this, like blue atmosphere that happens when things are further away. You just have to let your hand go limp so it just smacks away, you know. You just have to let your hand go limp so it just smacks away, you know. Absorb some of the impact by getting pushed back. Absorb some of the impact by getting pushed back. And also you can paint them more detailed the further away plants you can leave them a bit blurry or loose and then the closer they get to you you want to. You don't want to really lean into it. You don't want to really lean into it. Big punches like like punching a brick wall. Big punches like like punching a brick wall. Alright, so costumes this ones gonna be tricky. Alright, so costumes this ones gonna be tricky. Clearly Taylors don't, typically or, yeah, Taylors and typically make clothing for. Clearly Taylors don't, typically or, yeah, Taylors and typically make clothing for. Paint them. Paint them more detailed I guess. I hope that makes sense. Pamela Kyle's brushes are really good. I've been on a kick of experimenting with making my own brushes, though. I got into this like I don't know. A few months ago and I'm kind of addicted to it. So the brushes I'm using right now I've made an I'm working on putting together a brush set that will be available if anybody is interested in purchasing it. I do have a brush set that's it already is available now that I've made that is a It's like a Ghibli inspired brush set. It's got a lot of watercolor textures and. Plants and foliage type things. The brush that I'm working on right now is a little bit more dry. Traditional textures like pastels, charcoals, maybe gouache with a lot of dry brushing, that kind of thing. So yeah, a little bit of both. I've certainly used a lot of other peoples brushes, but at the moment I'm I'm interested in making mine, so I'm also I'm using a lot of custom ones right now. I. See I hope I'm not missing too much in the chat. You guys. Jennifer says. I'm trying to get you a picture of the ranch where I grew up so we can all work on it. But if an effort but I'll get it, that would be really nice. That would be really nice. How are you switching from black-and-white so quickly? Yes, it's a shortcut that you have to set up, but let me show you how to do it. OK, so once you set it up one time you're going. It's always going to be there, but you have to set it up one time, so you want to go to view. Proof set up. And then custom. I'm just going to go slow in case anybody wants to write this down. I'm sure you can also look it up later, but. So view proof, setup custom and then you click that and then this box comes up and then the only thing that you need to change here is. Under the device to simulate, you need to select working grade gain 20% from the drop down menu. And then you can click OK. So mines already done. So I'm just going to cancel it. But then after that anytime that you press CTRL Y it will turn your painting into black and white and you can just press CTRL Y 2. To go back to to the colored version. All thank you Pamela. Let me get a link for you real quick. Thank you for asking. So again, this is a previous brush set that I made that you can look at in detail. Make sure you like the textures and everything. The ones that I'm using right now are in a brush that that will be coming out soon, so but I'll link you in the chat. I thank you again for asking. I saw another question. I'm just going to go back up here. My painting is about 3 year old level Steven. Love you see the painting you shared. Alright, messing around with fresco cool. I like the textures you can see the textures of the brush strokes and fresco. Hey this is cool. Hey don't please don't don't feel bad you gotta start somewhere an I mean I like what you're doing. You got a nice bold hard edge and you've got some soft edges up here that those are. Those are good signs to me. I find a lot of times. People struggle, especially at the beginning with landscape painting of including hard edges. People really shy about hard edges. I just keep just keep working on it. You guys. If you saw some of my early landscapes you might be very surprised because they didn't look like this, so that shouldn't surprise you. But you know sometimes it can be. Yeah, they were looking pretty rough when I started. Thank you, Claire Z. Thank you. Uh, see, do you ever add texture to your paintings to look like an oil canvas? Not usually Anthony. Usually I just try to do that during the painting process with the brushes and with my painting style. I don't usually overlea texture at the end I've seen people do it. It can look cool, but it's just not my thing. One thing I will do is sometimes give a little bit of noise filter, but that's about it. Yeah, no problem Judy. The best thing about that is Oh my gosh, check this out. You can actually color pic when it's in black and white, so when it's in black-and-white you can color pic its color at picking the real actual colors and you can paint with the colors too. And then when you turn it back into color, it's whatever color that you painted with. So I use that a lot when I get confused and then I try to. Like figure it out and then go back to color. Yeah, exactly saying it's non destructive, it only is going to change your view and then you press CTRL Y and it goes right back to the colored version and it hasn't done anything permanent to your painting. Hi Pablo's, welcome. Welcome welcome. So I use that a lot. The other shortcut that I've set up for myself is the flip. Which is a little less useful today. I think the flip turn this over every time. But yeah, I like to flip the canvas because it gives me a fresh look at what I'm doing sometimes after I'm painting for awhile. You know, you kind of get kind of like have a hard time even seeing any of your mistakes at that point. So flipping the canvas it kind of helps. Give you a fresh view. Um followed one of your studies. It took me days to get an awful result here. Really fast indeed. Need to practice a lot more. And realize how good I am at photo shop and how bad at drawing. It just takes time. It takes time. It will definitely benefit you that you're good with Photoshop though. Like all that knowledge is going to be really handy in digital painting. Show us your early landscapes. Yeah, I'd be happy too. I have actually gone through some of those on the streams before. One day we can do that. I wish the sad thing is that. I lost one of my older hard drives. Had even more of the like very very. First one is in the sadly those have those have been like last time, but I do still have some some early ones that I can show in that some of you guys have seen but yeah. So I'm trying to give a nice texture to these fluffy little little trees up here. Little leaves and things. So I'm going to try to explain something I hope. I hope you guys will understand what I mean, but when it comes to painting faster and practicing with these kinds of studies, one thing that helped me was letting go of my expectations of how good any particular painting is going to look. And just trying to get everything in the scene painted in in this set amount of time. So let's say an hour or so is what I wanted to spend. The amount of time I wanted to spend on a painting instead of like so for this scene. For example, early on when I started doing that, I'm studies the thing that would be tough for me is I would end up with like one of the trees looking really good. And then a lot of the rest of the painting just not even being there by the end like I would run out of time. And then there would be like a whole area that I didn't paint. You know what I mean? And so one of the things that I had to start doing was saying OK. I'm going to paint everything in, even if it looks bad. I'm just going to paint it in so I would have like. Very rough, just like almost like cartoon looking tree that I just put in so that had something in there and then I would go to start working on other things and get everything in the scene. Just everything has to be in and then you can go back and improve different areas. And So what happens is overtime as you do these studies, you get faster. And. I would end up being better at budgeting my time slowly. You're going to be able to do more, and you're going to be happy with what you can do in that amount of time, but it's really hard to get the full benefit of doing that. I'm studies if you don't really treat them like a time study and you allow yourself to. Like take along time on some area and then the other area isn't done. So even if the results end up looking what you would consider as bad. It's still a success if you're able to get everything in the scene, even if it looks rough. Just get everything in that time and then just like let that be what it was you know. That is a study and then you can like close it. Never look at it again. If you want, you know these don't have to be for your portfolio necessarily there just for practice and less you want to make them for your portfolio, but that changes things a little bit, 'cause then you start being a little bit careful. Little bit too afraid of making mistakes. So allow yourself some studies where it's OK if they don't come out great and there's no expectation of posting or sharing. It would make a cool postcard, thanks. Populous as I once painted a landscape painting, it came out so bad you wouldn't even know it was a landscape painting. It's normal, it's normal. I used to be more of a character painter when I first got into digital art, I did almost almost only characters. And now I do. Now I do primarily landscapes. It's just my interests. My interests kind of changed overtime. So anyway, I'm just bringing it Up 'cause If you if you have the idea like I'm bad at this, I'm going to a landscape painter. You can change that if you really want to get into it. Don't feel like that you're doomed or something like even if you feel like you're not good at landscapes now. That said, This is definitely something that can change overtime. If you if you spend some time working on it just like anything I need to practice more on portraits and characters 'cause I haven't been doing that lately. Yeah, exactly those kind of unexpected colors in the skin. What painters inspire you, oh man, there's a lot. There's a lot OK, so I will tell you, the painters that are like inspiring me. Currently an I feel like every month I'm discovering new artists to follow. I got every day. Actually I'm. Yeah, it's there's a lot, but artists that have been really influential to my growth have been one. Would be Nathan folks. I love his work and his teachings on school. ISM are really, really helpful. The tutorials on there. So he's 1. James Gurney is one. I have watched a ton of his YouTube videos and I have or had one of his books until I moved and I gave it away but. James Gurney, who does a lot of watercolor gouache. Work big influence. Tiffany Mang is one. I can type these names in the chat real quick. Facebook may not be familiar with them to look them up. Who else? There's an artist adjacent sheer, but let me check how to spell his name. I think I've got it. Let's see. Jeremy Fenske, Oh my God, there's just so many it's I'm feel like I'm going to forget someone important. But you guys should look these artists of their amazing, uh. Lately I've been really enjoying the Henry Wong's. Clean air studies. He does similar stuff to what I'm doing here, only like really, really good. Ah, who else? Who else? I'm forgetting. John Park. Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot. Anyway. Those are a few that maybe you guys can get inspiration from. But I love searching through art on Instagram and Twitter and be hands and art station in all these places and finding new artists. I definitely feel like my style has changed and is changing a lot because of these people. You know, seeing their work inspires me. I want to try different things like oh, I like how they use texture. I wanna try that, you know and you end up incorporating little things here and there into your work. What other people are doing? Alright, we're getting closer to the end on this one. We're not quite there, but I'm starting to see starting to see the end of the road. I might turn off the sketch layer. I feel like we don't need it anymore. It's a little bit messy to see that sketch, and I think we got everything we need, so I'll turn that of.-. It's a very long list, I'm sorry honestly, I could go on like I could really go on. And that's been just over the last few years finding all these artists there's. There's another one. Oh, OK, there's one more. I knew I was forgetting someone, Tommy Kim, he does traditional. He does a digital and guassian. He's another one that's been really inspiring me lately. Besides yourself, who would you recommend for a beginner, non artist? Oh, let me get a link for you. Actually it might be below my. My stream in the description but let me. We make sure that we can. I don't know if the shortened link works properly. OK so I have a resources page. Yeah, Jackson enjoy. Uh. So check out the link I posted in chat, Pamela there there's a bunch of links to YouTube channels and all kinds of different resources on Gumroad. Different lots of different different tutorials and things that have helped me over the time that I've gotten into digital art and been doing that. So there's a whole bunch of things there. You know everyone has such different personal preference is it would be hard for me to recommend like one particular artist to you, but there's a lot of stuff there. A lot of different different artists that do tutorial, so you can kind of like Peru's and see if anybody's. Style appeals to you. That's my biggest advice to people that are getting into digital art or any type of art. And you're feeling kind of lost. Ask yourself, like ideally, what kind of art would you want to be able to do? Like? What are your preferences? And that means. That could mean style or could mean stop subject matter and that can change overtime as you learn more like this. Figure out what you want to do. Yeah, you're welcome. I really hope you find something helpful there. So for example, maybe you want to do portraits. Maybe you want to do animal paintings, maybe you know whatever it is an you can find a search for artists that are good at that thing. A lot of artists are selling tutorials nowadays Patris on gumroad, or doing free tutorials. There's workshops, streams, so if you find what you'd like to be able to do then you can start looking for guidance on that thing. If you don't really know what you want, it can feel really overwhelming. And just remember that just because you were starting with something doesn't mean you have to only do that thing forever, so it doesn't have to be something that you overthink. Just say, OK, I would like to be able to do portraits and just start following artists that do portraits. Just looking for them. On social media he ran be hands, watch some streams wherever whenever is convenient for you, and then you can find tutorials that way. That's what I did, and that's there's so much out there. Yeah, Pavlos gave a really good recommendation in the chat. That's a really good one. Marco Bucci. Man, I didn't list him in my top artists. I mean, I guess I gotta cut it off somewhere. But Marco Bucci is definitely been influenced with me with his colors. I absolutely love what he does with color. Haley are how are you welcome? Almost missed you there in chat? Well, I kind of. I mean I want to do more with this, but I feel like I should kind of rap this one up or I'm going to run out of time to do the other paintings for today. So I might I might like end this one here. I'll add a little bit more highlights to the. To the street here. But I think then we'll go on to the next one. I'm a photographer and always said painting gets lost at my elbow and won't come out my hand. I love landscapes. Well, photography is definitely art. Maybe maybe you'd be interested in getting into as a like a starting point. Maybe you'd be interested in like photo manipulation. Or maybe you already do that as a photographer, but you know you can certainly paint over your photos. Photo bashing is a thing, especially when they're your photos. You have complete ownership over them. You could maybe start with something like that. That's fun to do. All right? So. Last little details. I will go on to the next one. If we have time I could always come back and do some more on this, but. I will lock the layer so I don't accidentally somehow destroy this painting with some of the other ones that were doing. But yeah, here's our first 2 first paintings. Let's go on to the next one. Hopefully will have time to do for in this stream. That was my goal, although I had a little tech issues at the beginning. We were kind of catching up from then, so we'll see. We'll go for at least three, maybe 4, depending on how long things take, but the other two reference images that we have. They're both below in the description, and I'm going to. Open these so one is quite a bit more simple than the other. I'm a bit scared to be honest at this one that I picked, but somebody requested a painting a location in Singapore last week so I was looking around in there and on map crunch and you know it's kind of hard to find the perfect reference, but I found this scene which I thought was really, really pretty and just had beautiful, bright, cheerful colors. There's a lot of bounce light and interesting things. I do think it's really detailed and technical because it's a building and there's a fence and all this kind of stuff so. I think it might be a good challenge to try to simplify this. Like I said, I'm a little scared, but let's try it. Let's just try it. We gotta push ourselves a little bit. If you guys like the other image better, this was the other one which I think has cool lighting. This was the other one that was potentially going to be for our studies today. So you can do this one if you want. If you find this one more interesting. Already do photo manipulation. Thanks for all your encouragement. Cool cool, that's awesome. Always go about 2 hours and realize they didn't save. Yes, did I save? Yeah, so I'm I usually click it with. I usually click the shortcut CTRL S so I don't even remember. Sometimes when I say it 'cause it's just happening. Thank you, thank you Claire Z. Thank you Foster. Thanks everybody. All right? OK, so we've got the next image. And we're going to try again to keep pretty. To keep the our idea of getting the main. Feeling of this scene and not obsessing over every detail because there are quite a few details. So I think we can do it. Let's put the reference a little bit larger on the other monitor, so I have this next to chat. If you guys want to give it a shot, you can find the reference reference below the stream in the description. I'm going to take a quick savati before we start this one. Windows always get me Windows. Windows always get me in paintings. This one's got a lot of Windows. Gotta face our fears. Alright, we're going to do this composition. I think this one is a better shape for this scene. OK, so new layer I will do a sketch. I will do a sketch. I usually do sketches. We can get rid of the other sketch. So this will hopefully help us plan this out. OK, so here we go. If I want so if anybody feels overwhelmed by this, something that I can do to try to simplify things is think about the biggest shape possible and then work within that and make things smaller. So, for example, this house on the left, it's kind of like this at the most basic level, and then within this we've got these different floors. But we kind of got a shape like this and then down here there's another house next door. Ooh Jackson, let me see. So Jackson painted the last one with us. You guys, anybody who painted along, please feel free to share if you if you feel comfortable. Jackson this worked out really nice. I hope you're happy with it. I know you were feeling also overwhelmed by this reference. I love this texture for the the branches and leaves up here. This wispy texture that works perfectly for that type of plant. It's really, really pretty. I'm very happy with this. I hope you are. As beautiful as Purples. Lots of different variation, Hue variation up here. That was a tough one. The pathway was really tough. If I was going to come back and do anything, I probably work on my pathway a little bit more. And then we've got the ground here in the foreground, just a little bit of that. So within. This shape we've got like the top floor here. And then at the same time when we meet up with this other building next door. Got the next floor and then we've got. The. Like roof of the. The ground floor. This kind of thing, so I'm holding shift each time that I make us 'cause I'm trying to make straight line. So I'm holding shift to do that is helpful. So I think my proportions are a little off. I'm going to move this up. I think that second story. The first story seems a lot. I might just be because we're closest to it, but it seems a lot bigger. All right and then we have a fence. So I might I might try to freehand the fence. I just felt like I couldn't really do that with the house very easily, so let's try here. Something like this? And then. Got a gate in the front? And a big blocky thing. Don't know what that is in between houses. I don't know. It supports the gates. Big thing and then another gate here. So maybe we can zoom in a little bit more. Really focus on that one house and just have like a little glimpse of the neighbors. I know I'm going to have some proportions issues, but I'm going to try to keep things roughly the way they should be. So looking at the middle of this fence, this post comes up here and what is that line up with then? There's this other post here. These are the support like support beams. And this is all one solid. Yeah, structures I know, uh. There's a. There's a tree. Luckily that comes over here and covers up a bunch of stuff. Maybe we can make that re bigger. Can make the tree but put an extra tree. Um heilala I'm a graphic design student need to this platform and I really wanted to say that your work is amazing. Thank you lol welcome, I hope you enjoy it here and thank you so much. It's very nice of you and Hi Michael. Hi Mike, from UK better late than ever. Thanks for your brushes that I downloaded last week. Really enjoying your tutorials thanks that makes me happy to hear an. I hope you enjoy the brushes. Satisfied with how it turned out, the lasso tool technique for hinting leave seems pretty useful to experimenting with it lately. Lasso tool is so handy I go through phases of being obsessed with the lasso tool, and then I kind of. Lately I haven't been using it too much 'cause I've been going for this painterly effect in the lasso tool. Can be pretty precise. But I like I do like it still for those leaves. All right, so we've got step one. I'm going to try to erase away guidelines I don't need anymore as we go. 'cause otherwise things are going to get really hard to understand. So get rid of that diagonal line. An I might make a new layer, so on another layer we're going to do the door and other things that might start to get. Confusing. So this. Proportion is wrong. That should be like this. So there's a door back here. Oops, I was doing that in another layer. Try it again. There's a door, and then there's a window. Oh my gosh, there's so many windows and there's something else. It's like a cabinet or something. I don't know. I'm trying not to zoom in, so. That will help me from getting too obsessed with details. Gotta window here with one 234. Add suddenly the house is a deep forest. Over here something else that's covered up by plants. Thankfully all right up here. We got more windows. Hold shift for a straight line. This sketch won't be in my final, this is just helping me place place things. We will definitely be painting painting under this sketch and will get rid of it when we can, so I don't mind if things are a little messy as long as they are. Help me put things in the right place. So this window got 3. And then we can duplicate that. But we want room for one more. Oops. Again. Why am I doing that? Oh 'cause I'm also selecting that layer. OK, and then finally we got one window over here on the 2nd floor. Oh my goodness. But I do think that the light shining off the windows is really pretty and very satisfying in the bounce light. That glow got a great lighting effect, so that is going to be the focus of this painting. Another window with three probably again, copy that other one. Same here. Do do do. And it's probably one more of the same. Over here on the left, but it's partially covered by. Archery archery friend. This place looks nice. I like it. OK, the neighbors also have some windows, so they have some kind of like a balcony here and neighbors have one too. It's like about this high. I've got trees. Not sure you sorry. We have plants hanging. Something like that. OK, so just to assess before we get into things, I think between the second and third story I need to add some more room. So I'm going to merge the windows down. So we've got all this on the same layer, and then I'm going to select. This layer and move it up because I think there's a lot more space there than what I indicated. Ahahahahaha Jackson I know I'm sorry. I don't know what I. What got into me with this one? Yeah, if you guys can see the second story, we can actually see. Underneath the roof. Facing up towards it. So here's this support beam and then back here. Is the wall. And that's all underneath. Make an impressionistic version. Yeah, my sketch is all on one layer. It wasn't earlier, but I merged down at one point when I was like happy enough with it. Usually if I'm going to overlap things, I will keep it on a separate layer and then once I do once I draw the whatever is going to be overlapping and then I think that it's OK. Then I'll merge it. Hey project, the paint things are going good. I can give you a little preview. This was the first painting of the day here and then we did like some tropical vibes over here and now we are. Starting a pretty. Technical one, but I'm going to try not to get too technical. My actual painting. I'm laying things out here 'cause I think it will help make it easier, but when we get into it, I'm going to try to focus on the lighting in the mood and maybe some textures. Maybe some nice textures. It will be very impressionistic. Alright, so here's the end of this balcony. OK well. There's some other details in the foreground. I'm getting lazy though. I kinda just want to start painting. So we might have my just like skip on through, but there's there's a like a plant pots that are attached to this. Fence. Will plants? Um? Hi Jason, Good morning. Haven't watched from your streams in awhile. Glad to be here I'll go. I'm good to see you again. Yeah we did two studies so far these two up here and now we're we're beginning with another one so we came in a good time we're just starting this got through the sketch here and we're going to begin with painting in a moment. So an example of something that I would keep on a separate layer having to do with the sketch is I would definitely make a new layer if I wanted to sketch in the tree on the left coming in front. I would want to have that on a separate layer, 'cause I wouldn't want it to. I don't know, it would just feel crazy to do it right on top of everything, but I don't even know if I'm going to sketch that in. I think I'll just like wing that in the painting phase. 'cause it's a bit abstract of a shape. Anyway, I know that it takes up this whole area, but we can see through it a little bit 'cause it's kind of loose. There's a lot of space in between the leaves and branches. I think it would be hard to sketch that in without taking a really long time. So I'll just leave it out. Oh yeah, so the reference let me put it in the chat. Do. There we go. Trying to organize the. I'm trying to look at the composition. I want to give a little bit more room for the Sky up top. I think it's important. Nice blue blue Sky. OK, well let's start painting. I'm going to do a little clean up here and see what kind of random layers I have. I don't know why I have two layers that I don't even know what's on them, so will get rid of those. The other two are my other paintings will keep those. And then we'll put this layer on, multiply lower the Opacity so it's easier to see through an will, put it around 20% or so, opacity, and then lock the layer. Press the little lock icon here so we don't accidentally paint on that. And make a new layer underneath and then I'll start painting there. So. I think I will continue with the underpainting approach. So I'm trying to model this after traditional painting Workflow. I know that this might be really weird. For some people, because it was really weird for me at first when I saw artists doing this, I saw a tutorial of someone doing this kind of thing and I was like what on Earth? 'cause I didn't do I started doing even though I did traditional drawing first I got into digital painting before traditional painting, so I wasn't familiar with the whole underpainting thing. So this was really weird to me, but the idea is we're going to get rid of having a white or even Gray background. We're going to have something that if we show through to this color at any point, it's just going to give a nice warm glow. Yeah, thank you, we are. Yeah, I'm in CST. I'm in the Netherlands, so for me it's actually what time is it. 330, three, 30. In the afternoon it's crazy. Oh thanks Lee. OK yeah, you found them. Yeah OK so yeah so so that it helps get rid of the white. The Scary White canvas. And also it's nice because well if you look at the value you know it's somewhere in the middle ish so when you paint lighter you're going to be able to paint lighter and you're going to be able to paint darker and it helps give like a way to sort of in a sculpture away like carve out your shapes rather than just having the shade everything down from from a light color. I don't know that feels tough. Feels tough. Hi there, Liesl. I hope I'm saying Your name right. You guys can correct me if I mess up your names. Just found it yesterday. Love how you see color and light. Do you do any of your gouache paintings on live streams? All thank you. I do. Actually, I'll be doing that tomorrow on Twitch so I can put a link to that in the in the chat. I'll be doing some traditional. Painting. Every. Every. Thursday and thank you. Thank you for the nice comments. OK, so now we've got our underpainting an I will just make a new layer on top of that and then start my painting. So now I'm going to go with color for the Sky. Anne will pick something really. I want to go like really just as intense as the reference. 'cause That's really blue. Yeah, that's nice. So do you see when I, when I don't perfectly cover that area you see through with this like dusty kind of texture? I love it. I love it, so that's a nice thing about doing this kind of underpainting and we can also choose. So I'm going to color pic from the blue will go a little bit later. Anna little bit towards the green and will get just a tiny bit of a different Hue. And then we can go over top to give a little bit of a gradient. Just a little bit. So then we have a soft transition between the you know 'cause the Sky is always going to be deeper blue right up top and then towards the horizon it gets brighter and brighter and a little bit more washed out color so. Forget that a little bit. So next thing I like to work big to small, so we want to get rid of the Orange. I mean we don't mind a little showing through, but we want to get everything blocked in so. Uh. Let's figure out what color goes is going on down here on the ground. So there's a big range there's. There's the area and Shadow and highlight and I'm trying not to color pic from the reference so it takes me awhile sometimes. To guess what color is there, but I feel like a color similar to this is good for the darker areas, so I might use that as a starting point, and then we're going to add the bright white highlights. Oh cool, you're starting Nathan Foxes Landscape quote schools. Of course you are going to love it. It is amazing. It is like the best course that I've taken of that kind. And honestly is one of the most helpful courses I've ever taken related to art. It goes over so many fundamental things. It's really, really good. And he actually does a couple digital demos in that, even though it's like a watercolor and gouache thing, he does a couple digital demos, which was like a really cool surprise for me as a digital artist. That was like wow. This is awesome, so don't be nervous. It's going to be great. All thanks, you guys use colored gesso, that's awesome. That makes sense, yeah. So my experience so far. I do mostly like I do mostly guassian traditional so I don't have a lot of experience with gesso and things like oil and acrylic, so that's cool to hear about. So I'm trying to find a nice sort of shadow color for the building. Just as a starting point, I'd certainly want to get a lot brighter than this. But I really like the glow that's happening inside under the. For example, under their roof. Where there's like a little bit of a glow, and then you get the bright. Bright sun so hey, maybe I'll have to go back and forth to get the right colour. Maybe it will take a little time. OK, so I think for me this is actually enough that I'd like to start with the bright white areas and this painting. I feel like I'm going to use some selection tools to make sure things are pretty crisp. Even though I want a painterly look, I want those textures to exist within strong shapes that are going to make this easy to look at and understand what's going on. So I'm going to use the rectangle marquee tool to just select direct angle. And then we're going to pick a color that's really bright, almost pure white, but not quite there. What will figure out what's a good color for this area, but? And here we go. I'm just going to fill in this area around the windows where the really, really bright sun is shining on this house. Anne, I want the. The light to end kind of around the same area. what I could do is use a another brush and just erase out a straight line across everything that would also do it. Using gold gesso underwater color gives a bit of a glow. That sounds really pretty gold gesso. I didn't even know that existed. That's cool. Yeah, cool thing with using texture brushes like this on buildings is that it can give you that look like stucco or something. I mean, this building is honestly pretty smooth looking but yeah, it's an interpretation. So maybe I'll select a similar brush for the eraser so it can erase down into it, or very straight across. Depends on how bowl do you want to be with that? But looking at the reference, I think actually I should probably go a little higher. Oops. There we go, that's better, Yeah, Alright, let's go down to the next floor. I think this will make a lot more sense after we have the bright white in. Next thing would probably be windows for me. I'm doing this all on a separate layer too, so we might be able to easily edit things once I feel like I'm happy with where everything is, I'll merge it down. Got a little bit left to do before I feel confident about that. So holding shift go across for straight line. Hold shift. We don't need any bright areas in the middle here. That's going to be. Shadow One thing that I've learned is if you want your highlights to really, really stand out, there's only. You can only go so bright you know there's only you can only go to a maximum of pure white, so. What we could do is go to the background and go to like curves or brightness contrast and like kind of dark and things. Lube it more in everything else. I don't know. I don't know if I like what that does to the Sky that makes the Sky really intense. I might have to just work on darkening the building. I'm OK with how things are, but that's just a tip. Sometimes. If you're having trouble making the glowy areas look as Glowy as you want, or as bright as you want, you can consider darkening the other areas around it. Like relative. To that, and usually that helps make that area really pop. But I think I'm OK with how it is. what I might do is go a little bit more towards pier way in a couple areas. The nice thing about doing a sketch for this one is now it's like pretty relaxing overall to. Do like fill in the shapes. You wouldn't think of painting buildings is being relaxing. Putting the time in for the sketch makes this a bit more. Relaxing. See, these aren't lined up properly to the reference book. Hopefully it'll work. We've got a another highlight across the bottom here. And. We've got some dappled light on the. On this fence, so will have to come back and add more shadows, but I'll go pretty brave with it for now. Just to block in the shape. Cool. What am I missing? We've got other areas that are going to be bright, but I think these are the brightest. So I'm going to lock the layer that already do that, no lock the layer. Of course we're going to lock the layer there and then we can go brighter and then. Go even even more Bray just in a couple spots like right right where the brightest light is hitting were almost looks overexposed in the photo we can go a little bit brighter there. And that's it. That's the phrase I think I will go. Saying, says Daniel Smith, paint is made in Seattle. They have a pretty goal. Gesso and wonderful granulating watercolors. I've heard good things about Daniel Smith. I didn't know it was made in Seattle. That's so cool. Very cool. My sister lives well nearish to there. Awesome. OK, so I'm going to make a new layer under this layer. I think it might be easier to paint the windows. Having that having the white layer separate, so we'll see I won't merge it quite yet. I usually like to merge pretty often with these studies, but. OK, I think the next thing is that I want to work on are probably the rooftops and then it'll be hopefully easier to understand what's going on with these buildings. So up here, maybe I'll start with a. This warm, almost like Terra cotta ish color and then we can go a little bit brighter for some highlights. We can lock that layer. And just kind of do a little bit of a stripe like this is kind of a fun thing about doing. The stylized work is you can sometimes hint at things in a way that isn't necessarily realistic, but it gets the job done. It's kind of fun, so using patterns and stuff. A little shadow over here. That's pretty bright. Don't know if I like that. Better. Maybe a little shadow Ray on the Ridge here so it's. We can get a feeling of that edge. I like to do these little dots for a tile roof. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Robert. That's very nice of you. I'm glad you like my my gosh work. I think I've heard that comparison before. That's cool. Thank you. Yeah, I love bright colors. You guys I can't help that. That's one of the things that I love about gouaches for someone who likes bright colors and how bright you can get things in digital gouaches great 'cause you can also get really bright. OK, so this the roof here is a little bit darker. I think it's partially to do with the angle and maybe that tree. Or maybe it's actually just a different color? Is a different house. So some highlights here to show the reflection. This roof is definitely made out of some kind of different, but it looks like a different. Texture to me. It looks very reflective. We may come back to that. I'm not crazy about that, but well, at least get some of the reflection in. Here. We're going to get some shadows, so if you're having trouble picking colors for shadows and highlights in your work, here is something that I like to do is, for example this. I would consider be like real color or the local color of that. Roof is just a guess 'cause we're seeing it at an interesting angle with a lot of shadows and highlights, but this is what I'm guessing is close to the color that that roof actually is. And then. If you drag, if you color pic from there then you can go to your color wheel, go towards a darker color. Just drag that colored down and maybe will go a little bit more towards purple to have like a cooler Shadow and then you can access from there. If that's a good color for your shadow. If you want it to be darker or something like that. What is the name of your color wheel software? It is called Coulouris. If you look below the stream in the description, there is a link Anna Discount Code for it. If you're interested. It is a a plugin that is like a third party plugin. So if you have photo shop CC 2019 or any more recent 2019 or 2020 then you will have a similar color wheel just already included. That's a somewhat recent update, so if you go to window. Color. Then you can find it there. It might show up like this. The Hue Cube 'cause this I think was the default, so you can just go up here and select a color wheel. So this is similar and this is already included, but the cooler is has some extra features. It has gamut masks and things that can help you with different color schemes like you know hooking you up with secondary colors and different things like that. I honestly don't use that stuff too much, but for some people might be really nice to have depends. But I just like the triangle. I really like the picking the colors from the triangle personally. I find it easier for some reason. Some people really prefer the qubits. Apparently it's a personal thing. But yeah, I like the triangle format. Yeah, thank you. Thank you Millie. Yeah you can find it below. So we'll put a. Honestly, the underpainting color seems like a pretty good color for the area below the window. Tired out the window. The overhang of the roof on the 2nd floor. That color seems like it's working pretty well. Let's do windows. Let's do windows. I do feel like I'm a little all over the place, but I'm just trying to look at what areas have big shapes that need to be filled in so the White was really standing out to me as being like really important. And then the roofs were really big. And now I just think, OK, Windows should be next so I don't know. I try to explain my thought process, why I'm doing what, what, in what order, and sometimes I'm not even sure. But yeah, we're trying to get the big to small get through these important. Aspects so for the windows we could do something like this an make a selection with the. Rectangular marquee tool. So we make make one rectangle and then hold shift and you can make another rectangle and then hold shift and you can do something like that. And let's see what it looks like. Let's see if it ends up looking to mechanical or if we like it. So how to choose the right color? So we can drop in a color for the window. And then let's put in a highlight. So wherever the white is stopping, that's where we're going to that whole area. Below there, we want to have a lighter color. So we want to highlight to match up. You know, 'cause The Sun's hitting the windows and the wall. Hey, that could be a fairly fast way to do that. I do think that I'm too bright with the window. Let's Dark in that little bit. We are, it says, a little artist trading cards size. Quick sketch. Wait, you did a quick sketch of this one that is OK. Is the one before we are. I was like how? This is so pretty. I love it. It has a great enerji yeah really nice enerji impressionist. That kind of feeling. Is this pastel again? I love that texture. I gotta work on a texture I gotta work on a brush that looks like that. Lee art. I'm going to try to make a brush based off of your painting. Your pastel painting style. With Clarice, can you have the Hue Cuban RGB sliders at the same time? Oh I have no idea. I've actually never tried to do that. I actually don't even know if you can have the cube in Coulouris. I've never tried to use the cube before here. I don't know if they have one. Yeah, I don't know. I don't think you have the cube. I don't think you have the cube. Do you? Do you use the cube? Instead of the. The Triangle. Never looked for it before, but I don't see it. I didn't see it in the settings. All right, so we've got windows. I mean, I could just duplicate this window. Can shift it a little bit more towards blue. So I'm trying not to color pic from the reference, but sometimes it gets to the point where I might breakdown and do it soft pastels. So pretty so pretty. I was going for that kind of thing with this brush actually, but. I got more work to do. What are you using Strama computer? I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22. It's a screen tablet. I'll type the model in the chat. So you can look it up if you like. Alright, I will continue with the windows in this manner, 'cause I feel like it's working pretty well. So. Yeah, I might just duplicate once and then. These windows have a little bit of a different lighting to them. There's more sons will do these. Separately, will do with their own. Their own painting. Alright, so I'm selecting everything we can select this one too. And this can be a starting point. I'll color pic from what I have over here on that window and then these are just going to get a little brighter. So this one is basically the same, but then we get. Bees get super bright lot of light hitting. You're a Hue Cube fan. I didn't know this about you. I'm just kidding. I wish I was, you know, it was a problem for me for awhile till I found something and now it's The Standard and well, not standard, but it's an option in Photoshop so. No problem, that's cool. Yeah, I don't think it has the Hue Q. Oh Ryan Oh my goodness, how are you still awake? I'm wondering if we should make a set up section. Actually, now that you mention that that would be amazing. Yeah, we are having a lot of, you know similar questions which I don't mind. You guys are totally fine to ask that. 'cause like somebody you might not be here when somebody asks it earlier like don't feel bad if you want to know something, just ask me. But yeah, yeah and it may be that would be good. To be able to put a section for like. Tech details and stuff. OK so yeah we got top floor windows. So one thing I might want to do is. Come in between these windows and bring that color little bit of. That White glow. The wall paint color. And if I turn off the sketch, if I can find that layer. Yeah, then well, we see that a lot of areas are not blocked in yet, but you can see how the. How the windows look? Put that back on. Michael says there is an Adobe extension in Photoshop 2020 called Adobe color themes, which is worth a look. Cool, thanks. The non triangle. Oh, thank you as well. OK so yeah we go on. Right? Oh, hang in there. I hope I hope you're almost done. I'll put a little bit of a shadow under the. Under the roof, turning on, turning that layer on a Nov or that really made me realize I need to work on this area. Oh yeah, yeah Ryan. Absolutely no. I totally know what you meant. Totally know even I just didn't want to discourage anyone. Alright, the same will add A. Highlight a little bit of a cooler color. I absolutely love this in the reference. If you guys can pick up on it underneath the so the 2nd floor underneath the roof. There's there's some bounce light and. It's just, it's really, really pretty. It's a little bit. I don't know what color it is. Honestly, let's call it pick and find out what color is. It's that color. What do you call that? If this color. But it looks really cool compared to everything else like wow. Mine is like way too bright. That's OK, I'm going to keep going 'cause I've been working a relative to the other colors in my painting, so I want to change it now, but. Yeah, I really like that highlight. Oh that's awesome Ryan great. I'm glad to hear it. Get a little bit more of a shadow under the top here. OK. Yeah. Who merged that down? Gotta start merging things. I don't like it when there's too many layers. Will merge the windows. And merge this too. OK so we have. Basically everything on the same layer right now. And we're going to add more windows. So let's do the same thing we did before will make a selection. For the windows and I wouldn't look into a bunch at once. So here do do do. And here. I'm trying to leave a little space in between the windows. For the wall. I call that color. Desaturated cappuccino brilliance. I'm like I'm not even going to try. I like that. I could go for a cappuccino right now. All right, and one more over here. Maybe we'll just select all these. Shall we do it all? Will just get all these will do assembly line windows. So I'm holding shift to add to this election every time and you can hold alt to subtract from it if you select too much. You can also control Z. You can undo a selection, so. Super handy. Down here we've also got windows. Let's just get 'em all. So for example, down here, if I select with the rectangle tool, then I end up overlapping some other things, so I can hold alt and. Deselect areas. And let's go back here. Dude. Do. OK, we got a whole bunch of window selected, so let's see what we can do with them. So one thing you can do if you feel safer painting like this is you could just drop in a flat color on all of 'em. So and then you could paint on top of that because you'll have you'll be able to do a lock transparency could press that button and then little checkerboard button on the top of your layers palette. Then anything you do will only affect those shapes. So if you feel like it's too, it doesn't feel comfortable having this big selection. I don't mind having this election for a long time, it doesn't really bother me too much, but. If you want to, you can feel something in there, but for me we're just going to go like this. Through the windows. So the next one down here, this one is pretty dark, so we'll start with our shadow color and maybe go even darker, maybe a little bit blue. So those windows are pretty dark and had a couple little highlights. Things look shiny. Down here so we have a shadow from the. Yeah the the overhang of the roof here. Love the right windows on the top floor looks like cloud reflection. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, I could see that. I wonder what really is I, I'm sure. Well, the sun is really bright, so that's part of it. But you're right, it looks like clouds. That's awesome. I didn't even think about that. So we'll make these pretty bright too. We can go a little bit more from a blue green blue to a blue blue. And then the bottom. We've got pretty dark windows. Clever is so funny. Yeah, there's been a lot of instances of excluded windows from my paintings, seriously? There's been a lot of times where I just especially getting speed studies where I'm like we don't have time for Windows well. Yeah, specially windows and reflected things. But here I'm trying to make up for it all in one painting, trying to get all the windows in this one. I want to put some random little shines in here. Little tiny reflections and things. And these windows are pretty dark over here. OK. Are we bear? A little extra. Contrast. OK, we deselect and this is what we have man. Those windows on the bottom they just seem like super out of place. It's just because they're so dark and everything else around them. It doesn't quite fit in yet so we'll get there. Will get there. We just gotta work on the other things around those windows and it will start to make more sense. But yeah. So. Are we still need the we still need the sketch layer, but I'm looking forward to not needing it anymore. Let's work on making that happen, so I want to fill in everything that. Right now we're relying on the sketch for. So one thing would be the. Looks like a metallic kind of affect on the edge of the roof. So we'll make a new layer, paint that in. We can lock the layer and then if we wanted to look metallic or shiny then we need contrast so it looks like there's some little like ripples in it. Hello mother ship welcome thank you thank you. Can't be faulted, their windows were meant to look past am clever. I see where you get your name. That's going to be excused from now on. Thank you. A little bit of highlights to make this look shiny. Does it read? OK from afar. Hopefully we can always paint over it. I'll try not to get too upset, obsessed? OK, let's go to the second floor and do the same thing. Just hold shift. For straight line. I think there's a little bit of reflection of light from the trees, so we get a little bit of green on this. Just a tiny bit. It's nice that we have a straight on view and I can just hold shift to make a straight line. If it was, if we had a different angle. Then I wouldn't be there. Wouldn't be so convenient. So adding some highlights. To the roof. The. The refund Papa the first first floor hoops. Tried to make a straight line and that's what happened. That out. OK. Michaelsayscolor.adobe.com great place to play and find colors which can then be saved straight to your library. Thank you. Thank you for the suggestion. OK. So the next thing I want to do is where the roof on the top I want to pick a darker, almost Brown. Color. We are getting a bit of a hard shadow right under the tiles and it's pretty intense. The contrast I'm going to do this on a separate layer 'cause I'm still unsure about the colour I'm I'm choosing to go a little less saturated. Do you want to see something cool? Yeah, definitely. And will try. Doing that same thing here. Maybe if I apply the shadow to more than one? Floor it will start to. Start to work. Gotta get that highlight on this one too. This house is. Really pretty. I want to I want to get this. Top of the second roof. The roof on the second floor. A little bit more the right colors right now. Whoops, we just have the blue Sky. Showing, but we want this. Peachy color instead. Try to rotate the view and raw with the shift key down. Try to rotate OK. Actually, what is the shortcut for rotate? I literally never do it. Let's have to do it this way. Oh wait, that's The Transform. Whew. Every once in awhile I rotate by accident, but I actually don't know how to do it on purpose. Can somebody tell me how? Yeah, I like we were talking about earlier today, but I only ever flipped my canvas for some reason. Well, there's a little bit of back story as to why, but I never rotate it and I don't even know how to do that. But I'm curious what happens. It's just R. Oh yeah, I should've known that I OK yeah it's are OK so we've rotated. And. Now I'm going to hold the shift. Ah. So it's still. It's still horizontal, but because I've rotated that can make the line in that direction just R. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks you guys. That's cool. Maybe that's a reason for me to actually rotate my canvas. So we were talking about earlier like why do I not rotate and the basically the story is I used to do some. Process videos and things and I notice that when I would record and try to speed up the process of me painting with. When when I would rotate the canvas it would make it really not nice to watch the video sped up 'cause it would be like very jarring with everything. Tilting around all the time, so for process videos I kind of got out of the habit of. Using that function and then I just started relying on flipping the canvas, which also can be a little bit annoying if you speed the video up a lot. But yeah, I got used to just only flipping every so often and then I never use rotate anymore. Didn't even know what the command was. Anyways, the shift draws actually constraint to the views horizontal vertical, so you can draw straight lines at any angle by rotating the view. That's cool, thank you, thank you for that trick. I might use it in the future, 'cause that comes up sometimes. You can also do the make A dot and then making a hold shift to make another dot and it'll make a line between the dots, but you see what happens here. So for example dot, you can barely see my DOT but thought shift dot. Oh, because the weight here we make it on the layer above, so dot shift dot but it will apply the like pressure sensitivity of your brush, so you'd have to turn of- transfer an shape dynamics to make that work you know. Yeah, so then then then you get that straight line, but it won't. It won't be. You won't be able to like use the. Control things as much. Nice. OK, well I'm glad it helped. Thank you, thank you David. OK, so let's. Get back to our house. I think I'll merge down what we've done so far. Will keep going what? What else do we need to put in? To the sketch so that we can get rid of the sketch. So I want a new layer and I'm just going to work on some things. Oops, let's let's get my transfer back on my brush. Yeah, I don't like to work without that. Just make sure that the lighting is making sense. Like where does this white glow end should be the same on both of these columns? Thanks, I'm hoping that will help me about a tablet years ago, but almost never use it because it was always wanting to turn it and it doesn't work like that all there you go. OK are are an you can turn everything. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, David. OK, so let's figure out I don't really know what happened over here, but for some reason this roof is like really far away from the other house with. That's not how it should be. Let's get these guys a little closer. Leart says I'm actually used to not rotating the canvas due to doing traditional art, so you don't rotate. So for me I never rotate my paintings when I'm doing gouache painting for example, 'cause usually it's taped down to a board or to my desk. But if I'm sketching with pencil or pen, I do find that I will like rotate the paper if it's like the papers loose if it's not taped down then I will. I will turn it. It kind of depends on the medium. So I want to go a little bit more towards green and a little bit darker for this. Shadow under here. It's maybe a little bit about Yankee color on its own, but I think in the scene it's kind of nice. And it's a result of bounce light. There's a bunch of plants and things I think those might be affecting it. Light bounces off the plants. So I'm looking at the time I do think we're going to end up just finishing this painting for the day. I don't know if, well, I think we won't have time to do a fourth. 'cause this one is turning out to be a bit time consuming and we had some tech issues earlier. So yeah, I think we'll just finish up this one and that will be my goal for this stream today. Just for you guys that were. Following along with the paintings. And these windows also should be a little bit lower. I think I made them a little bit too high. There's a bit of space under there between. So little shadow under that like overhang. Bring that will further over to this side comes. Out over top of. That other post. Very cool. Thank you yeah I am project I've been using actually one brush from most of this painting. I think I did the underpainting with a different brush and other than that I've been using one brush. I'm really happy like it. I've been enjoying it too. Alright, let's get some light on the ground as well. There's some bright light hitting the pavement. Yeah exactly, we are. I'm going for a soft pastel kind of look. So there's these kind of streaky shapes. I think it's just from water washing down the driveway out into the street, so you get this kind of streaky look down here. So looking at the reference. So I'm going to lighten things up and then I think add the darker streaks back in. I'm just looking at it and it looks mostly lighter, so I think maybe that's a better starting point, mostly lighter. And then we'll add the dark colours then. And then over here on the ground it gets a bit darker. Thanks. So here we go. Kind of Fanning outward like this. And I'm going to flip my canvas to try to get a fresh look. I've been painting from one angle for a long time and I probably should've flipped it earlier. Yeah, now when I see this, it makes me want to. Bring this a little bit higher. Yeah, that feels better I think. And we see this sidewalk go all the way into this like courtyard area going up to the front door over in the neighbors. And we're also going to get a bunch of plants and stuff over there. So that's an area I should probably. Try to get rid of all this orange. There's a window in here. Something, or maybe it's a door, I don't know. You can also hold Elan use the lasso tool with your brush. Who? You know that would really be super handy for me, Michael, thank you for bringing that up. I think I will. Maybe I'll reprogram that to a different key. I've reprogrammed most of my hot keys to the left hand because then it's like so much easier for me to reach them if I'm trying to figure out where L is on, like looking over at my keyboard. Yeah, that one. I would use a lot. I would use that old time, yeah? And then it goes back to the brush. I probably should have. Got that one set up earlier. We aren't going to need three versions of the brush, one for hard soft pastel, one for medium, an extra soft. Hey, if you. No pressure, but if you would like if you were inspired too if you like. Scribbled like on the paper a little bit with those different examples of those three, I would definitely use it as inspiration. I would use it to help design the brushes. Or if you have any paintings where you used them and you. He didn't mind sharing. I would definitely take a look at that. 'cause I don't have a ton of pastels myself. I have just that one set. But it would really help to see I've actually been watching some videos on YouTube to try to see people painting with different materials. And that helps too, but. Ha. Nice project. Paid 2D and 3D. They combine very well. So you'll be in good shape. We decide to. OK, so let's start with some foliage. Finally, will paint some plants. Let's flip this over 2. So right now I'm working on the left in neighbors area. Or maybe that's still their house. I don't know. This could be just like a really Big House. It looks like it's their neighbor though. And then over the neighbors place. I'm going to start with some. Darker brownish green maybe will put a little shadow underneath there too. And then we'll go from there into a more green green as we get into the real color of the plants. Move our way up into so when I'm painting plants I like to areas that are in shadow. I like to use more of a blue, green, darker color is something I've noticed from doing a lot of photo studies. So sometimes even in a scene where it's not so dramatic, I still like to use this as a sort of how I how I do it. So Blue Green in the shadows and then getting more up into a yellow green as it gets brighter and brighter than that will make it look more like the sun is hitting the plants. So I kind of like the vibe that I'm getting from sticking with this texture throughout the painting, so I'm going to try to resist going and grabbing different brushes. Right now when I paint foliage I have, I usually have a lot of fun with like grabbing different brushes and trying them out, but I'm going to try to stay loyal to this one because I think in the end it might give a nice look, but there is. There's a cool plant up here that's got this kind of leaf, so let's do that. It's a little little star burst kind of thing. Give a little bit of a variety to the type of plants we see here really. Oh my gosh, thank you leave. That would be awesome. Thank you. Alright, so I'm painting this on a separate layer, thankfully because I want to do something underneath there. There's a part of the architecture that I haven't really paid much attention to yet, but over here we've got a wall that comes out and comes towards us and the color in there's a little alcove in there, so I just want to put that warm ish color behind the foliage here and that will make more sense. Trying to match the reference. We're getting closer to not needing the sketch anymore, but we've really needed it this whole time. All right? So there's our plants I want to go to a lighter color green. For some of these leaves that are getting hit by. Late. And then if we go down we get more and more into the darker Blue Green. Not sure if I like that I'm going to put that layer behind the other one. I think that's just a little peek, little bright green peeking through. That's that's fine. I would like to go back and do more with this foliage later, but. I want to move on now. There's going to be a fence covering good amount of it, so I don't want to go too crazy and then have to paint over all that. That's the worst, that's sad when that happens. Kind of get attached to an area you paint, and then you realize, oh wait, that has to get covered by a bunch of stuff. So there's some kind of I don't know if it's like a storage cabinet or something. There's some kind of Brown rectangle over here. That's all I know. That in. Part of house, it has a little bit more of a warm color. So let's try it again. Oh yeah, I'll move this back. Forgot about my reference. Hello. For some reason my shortcuts not working anymore to flip this. OK sorry guys, oh there we go. There we go OK, I don't know what I was doing wrong but we got it. Little warm light in between the windows. Maybe nice to paint over the edges of windows so they don't look so. Clean compared everything else in the painting. And we can go even a warmer color for the door, so it's a pretty door. Wooden door with a bunch of details. We're not going to do all the details, but. And get this nice warm color. You can really tell there's a lot of glow. Details on the side. And then gold handles. I think I could add a little bit more light on either side of the door. There's quite a bit of bounce light here, just like we're seeing on the ceiling in the second. 2nd floor. Ha ha. I was getting worried too. I I don't know what happened. OK, so there's going to be a fence covering a lot of what happens here, but I'm just going to put in a light background. So what we're doing is we're seeing through the fence into the like the pavement that's reflecting a lot of light on the ground here. So make a new layer and. Pick a color for the fence and we might end up changing this. Till we find the right color. But I think this is OK start with. So let's just hold shift. And make a bunch of. I'm going to keep my brush the same size. So the the slots of this fence will be the same size. This is on its own layer, just have to double check. OK, and then we'll go with a darker, almost black color. Oops, that's too dark. Around the outside. Maybe less saturated, it looks like it's some kind of metal and it's reflecting a cool color. Is the blue Sky. So something like that. It could be a little bit more room the top. There we go. OK. So there's our fence. And. Yeah, it's a little bit busy. It's a little bit busy. So what we can do is underneath that layer we can maybe try to make things. Cleaner so that the fence. This, like stripes of the fence, will be easier to see. Or maybe it maybe it's not so important. We can test things out. So the door comes down a little lower so we can have the color of the door coming behind there. Same thing over here. Yeah, we don't see through a lot. I mean, you can't really tell in detail what's going on behind there so we don't have to get too detailed and crazy with our rendering behind there. But yeah, that's a little bit better. Just allude that there's some stuff going on. Merge that down. Alright, I'm excited that we're getting into more finishing things. It's hopefully going to start coming together. An plants plants. I've been waiting for that. So one thing we can do before we merge the. The fence I could duplicate the layer. If you want a more solid look. Also, we can lock the layer here an add some shadows and highlights like for example if you want the bottom to be darker or if you want. A darker shadow underneath of individual slots of the fence. You could do that, maybe that will help it look more 3 dimensional. So doing the same thing with the holding shift for straight line. And just doing a tiny little bit underneath each. Thing It doesn't take too long I mean, I think it's worth it. You can do the same thing on the top with a lighter color. So color pic from the fence just go a little brighter and. And maybe not every single one needs it, you know? But like a little highlight here and there. OK, I think I'm happy with that. There also is. Some kind of post in the middle which I've sort of ignored groups. Let's get that. So on a new layer will come like this do. And there is a lot to do in the scene, even with trying to keep it simple. Right, so little highlight. On the metal. Metallic area. Thank me by need to move the center over to the right a little bit. Doesn't feel quite centered. Alright, will merge that. OK. Next Area on the left. Let's get this fence finished up so there's a whole bunch area that's in shadow. We've got some cool and warm shadows here. It's going to be nice. You had the plans. Shadow underneath the. Plant holders Start to make some sense of this area. There's a little flower pot. Weather in. There's also some dappled light, some. Flashes of light and shadow from the tree, which we haven't painted yet. The highlights and shadows on the fence is so satisfying for some reason. Thank you, I'm glad that boat extra detail is worth it then. Thank you Pamela. Claire C. Come over here on the left there's. I think maybe it's the neighbors fence or something like a blue Gray color. Just the basic shape in there for that. There's also a bunch of little little garbage and recycling bins. I don't know if I'm going to paint those in or not I mean. I do feel like that kind of adds something. I don't know well, we're not going to focus on at first, that's for sure, but if we feel like something is missing at the end that we can consider it. Right, so if we're looking at this fence, an 3D mindset, then this side of the post? Yeah, we gotta figure out where the highlights and shadows are, which the sun is coming from the front aiming towards this house. So everything facing the front is kind of really bright like but on the left side of the post here we've got shadow. Little Shadow and then we have to look at the right side of this one is in Shadow and then there's a really intense light stopping right at the corner. Where is this image from Singapore from Singapore? Someone requested Singapore last week so I went looking. And this is what I found. Well, I found a bunch of different pictures but. I was searching on map crunch. Which. You know, grabs images from Google Street View. So it wasn't like just a whatever Google images found for Singapore. So there were a little bit more. Like residential things and stuff like that. Hey Donna, how are you? So there's a bunch of. Foliage and plants. Here I think it would help me to paint these in and then hopefully will happen. Is the fence is going to be easier to paint after that? Right now I'm just having a struggle where the background color is not as dark as it's going to be an it's kind of tough to judge. Right, we can maybe put some flower pots instead of the garbage bins. With a little more aesthetic. But sometimes fainting those details can be, you know, make a place look more like. People really live there, and that kind of thing. Yeah. So get the lasso tool. And I'm going to select. And hopes that didn't go too well. You know what? I'm just going to Freehand Lasso. Never mind. So I'm selecting the area that I want to paint within. And we're going to work on the shape of the posts, but I just want to work on the. The general. General area here. Oh, thank you. Thank you Pamela, I'm glad to hear that. That makes me happy. I hope you guys are having a good day. Appreciate the company. I'm going to try just painting these and see how they go. I was thinking about actually using the lasso tool to select individual like plants. These kind of look like. I don't know. They really big leaves. Let me zoom in. There's almost like banana leaves or like. Something like that. Yeah, that really cool. OK, So what I might do is take my brush and go to the shape dynamics and turn on pen pressure. So this will make it so that you can see what's happening. The difference is that my brush will be go to more of a point and then as I press down more it's going to get thicker so. Let's try that, maybe it'll help with painting these plants. So that way I can try to get more of the shape of them with one individual brush stroke so some of them we get like the little stem. Then the leaf. There's a lot of plants. There's a lot of leaves overlapping, So what I'm thinking is maybe I'll do like layer one of these darker ones, and then we'll add the highlights. The kid lock the transparency. And choose a lighter green and just kind of go over the leaf shapes already made. So that looks a little better. Especially when we zoom out, you gotta zoom out. Yeah, that's OK. We can. We can go somewhere with this idea. Thank you, Lena. I'm going to make a new layer underneath this and let's let's color pic from the window as a starting point and will go a little darker. And I'm going to use that color back there. And over here. So if you look at the references pretty dark all over here under the. The roof. And behind the plants. So we'll just put more will, put more leaves and for coming in front of this. Going to call it failed hard with this one. I'm posting the whole page so it's even smaller. Jackson, OK? Let's take a peek. I don't blame you like this. One is a workout. Oh. That's adorable guys. Check this out so these are Jackson Jokers Studies with us today. You did a really good work today. Nothing to feel bad about even this one. I don't. Maybe it's the foliage that's bugging you, but I think the House the bounce light in between these floors. That's one of my favorite things about the reference and I can get that turned out really well in your painting. Anyway, I hope you feel good about today overall, even if this, even if you don't really like this one. I like the Ibrox Pression. Oh yeah, yeah, I'm also getting. I have to admit, this one is like tiring me out how I don't know how long we've been working on this one, but it's been a challenge. Yeah, I agree Pamela, I agree. All right, we're going to keep going. We're going to keep going. So there's Oh, Oh, I just noticed like a big thing. OK, so this. The roof here. It actually goes up like that. This is lower OK. Can discoveries? I just didn't really pay attention to this earlier. Honestly, I think what I was doing with sketch I said something like, Oh, the tree will cover this so I don't have to pay attention to it. And now. I'm trying to figure things out. OK, so this is going to come down. A little bit. And then we can get some. Little. With little shadows to show the end of the tile roof, there we go. Yeah, that is something I totally missed. Alright, better, OK, we're getting there. Let's add a little bit more, a dappled light, some of these bright highlights are hitting the. Side here and upon the. The roof. And will paint another. Let's see if I can. Yeah, I can go to select reselect. That's handy. Don't have to select that again. And let's add some more plants so this time maybe we'll have the plants coming. In front of this other group, so will start to give a layering effect. Hi Muneer, how are you? Yeah, we got this big group and they reaching out. I mean if you look at the reference these plants, they come all the way in front of this window. So I gotta add a lot more. Let's select that again. Re select when we're going to add a whole bunch more. Over here. And we should be in good shape. More plans the better as far as I'm concerned. So I'd like to have some leaves going in different directions there for the most part, they're all kind of like going in One Direction mean they're pretty organized looking. Do we want to get a little bit of a lively feeling? I'm going to turn on color dynamics on my brush. See if that does anything interesting. Color dynamics should give some slight Hue variations. It's barely noticeable. I usually have my color dynamics settings really low. So that it looks natural but. Let's turn it up a little bit. Not happy with the last one, but overall I really enjoy painting along an Mattie. I'm loving how this one is turning out a bit different from the others but still really beautiful. Thank you. Yeah it is different from the others. A little bit less painterly and more. I don't know. It feels a bit more. Mega stylized review, where you put it? Happy you like it. I'm enjoying this one. I've been kind of working towards. I've been wanting to experiment with this kind of style for a while, at least at least In addition to other types of painting that I do. You know, I'm never going to. Want to feel like, Oh I can only paint one way. I really like trying new things and new workflows. But I see. There's been a lot of more stylized art that's inspired me a ton over these last couple years, especially recently. And it's nice to try. Try it out. And feel like somethings working 'cause I had a lot of attempts. At doing this kind of work on various streams. Feel like it's finally starting to. Get a little bit more natural for me. Alright, well I have to add another fence which I'm not super excited about. But here we go. I'm going to color pic from the fence I already have here on the right. And yeah, we use the same size brush and we should be able to do this. Not too much trouble. I'll turn off color dynamics again and we'll just go 12. 3 four OK, I guess it wasn't too bad. Ann Maybe I'll just duplicate this. Make sure it's exactly the same. Poop. Really thank you. Yeah, I like the texture too. It's been a little bit of I feel like I've had to use some discipline to stop from switching brushes, brushes, 'cause I usually like to use a few throughout the painting. But it's help. Things feel more consistent to stick with one. Ha feel like I've walked by this house in South Florida in Miami. You know, it's interesting. You say that because when I was looking for references so this the reference is actually in Singapore and somebody requested last week to do a place in Singapore. So I was looking for that an when I was going through on the Google Street View Thing. I was really surprised because I you know, if anybody doesn't know, I kind of grew up in South Florida. I spent a lot of years living there and it reminded me there was a lot of houses with like tile roofs and just kind of similar architecture and some similar plants and things. So I yeah, I thought I kind of had the same feeling which is funny, like of course there's a lot of differences too. But I noticed some similarities that surprise me. So bitter about more fences haha right like come on, I'm done with the fences. Almost though almost we're going to add a little highlight to this. Also dispense also be somewhere. Needs a little bit of light hitting. I think this is one of my favourites. The depth of the floors is drawing me right in. Thank you. Oh OK, I'm going to lock that layer and maybe I went a little overboard with the highlights. I don't know. Will go over some of those that. The shadows are also clear. OK, so God Fences. And we need to bring this wall up now so that this makes this is nice and flat. There shouldn't be that much space. And then. The bright white lights I'm going to color pic from the reference 'cause I'm very curious what that color is of the wall in the shadow had how far to? Oh, it's actually not that bad. I was curious if my value was really off. It's actually not that bad. OK. It just felt wrong. For some reason. I wasn't sure if this shadow was right, but maybe we can just work on the transition between the highlight in the shadow. Maybe that'll help. Matt is on the fence about more fences, basically. A Spanish common in South Florida? Yes, yes. A lot of people speak Spanish there well, there's a lot of people from Spanish speaking countries that live in Florida. And so. Then They have that background and no speak Spanish and a lot of people because of that. Also want to study Spanish because it's a good thing to know in that in that area. So yes. Offense Madness. OK, so a little bit of a darker. Shadow underneath the. So this comes down this matches up here. Alright, I'm excited to get these little. Planters. So full of plants. It's going to be really cute, I think. Ah, I just notice something. So I can bring this fence a little bit further over. On top of that. That will help. Hopefully with the depth. And then. Yeah, let's start with the plants. So I think my sketch layer has. Yeah, you can see that things have moved a bit from where I sketch them in. But we did have a little planters like that. So. Make a new layer and. Color do we want this? Is going to be really cool because the plants are just like my favorite kind of effect. The plants are partially in Shadow and partially in highlight, so I'm going to right now. I'm going to only focus on the shape of the plants first. I'm not going to worry about the. The color, I mean, I'm just gonna pick a random green. And one thing that I think is so cute about these planters in the front is how like puffy and rounded. And just like. I don't know. I like how the plants look in the front. It's very cute, so we're going to get the shape first like this. And then will work on the colors. Sometimes it's easier to do that in steps. And there actually. So the planters are close together and pretty full, so there just meeting together with the plants are meeting together in the centre. OK, so now we can take the lock the transparency up here I'm going to flip. And we can go with a more like green blue color. Go darker. Yeah, over here it's going to be in shadow with a more of a green blue and then on the right were going to get into like a yellow warm yellow. Then we can have a little bit of a transition there, but the sunlight I really makes the sunlight look nice. Oh, thanks for hanging out with us Michael and thanks for the tips and stuff. Enjoy the rest of your day. And we can add some little little leaves. Little highlights. I like to add these blue green highlights. A little bit of texture like this. And then we can. Add some later highlights and we get into the Sunnyside. The more yellow highlights. Pretty cool. And maybe we can have some. I'll turn off the air, turn on the shape dynamics again. And we'll go little bit more of a pointy tip, and then we can add some little spikes. 'cause these plants look kind of spiky. This one has a nice book feeling for some reason. I can also see a girl with a person walking down the street in a similar style. Maybe I should try to add that in. I don't know if well. Well, I know. I certainly won't be able to do it during this stream 'cause we're kind of nearing the end, but. Maybe maybe I can experiment with that a little bit. Thank you. So on a layer below that, I do feel like even the white color picked from the reference. It just feels like this needs to be darker over here. I don't know what that is. About But I'm going to darken this a little bit. Yeah, there's some areas that can use a little bit of cleanup. Little bit of polishing. Surround the windows with those hard edges. We could sort of. Go over those with something more textured. That was the area I use the lasso tool for and I think it stands out a little bit. There's some little details on the outside of the door. Congratz Oh my gosh. Well. Congrats. I hope you're going to. Get a good rest. After that. I could actually raise out some of what I just did there. This is why I like to work on a separate. Um layer and kind of check. Check my work before emerged. Sometimes I find that I took something in that direction. I don't really like. I like to be able to erase out before I commit, so I'll usually work on a separate layer. For awhile and then turn the later on and off. See how it looks and then merge down from happy with it. It gives me a little chance to fix stuff. Hey Andy, how's it going? For anyone just coming in, we've been doing studies today at this third one I think is going to be the last one, 'cause there's still a bit left to do on it, but this is what we did for the day so far. This one was really fun. Oh, at the beginning it wasn't, but it ended up being really fun. And yeah, this is one we're doing right now. Ah. Right, I'm glad we could be with you to the end there. Oh yeah, we have another fence. My gosh I forgot the neighbor. The neighbor has offense, OK? OK guys. Let's do this. So we're going to make a new layer. It's a different kind of fence, though not. The same style. But we're going to try similar approach. So this is a black fence. Metal. And it's got a little bit of a fancy design. So something like this, it goes off the side of the screen. This is on a separate layer so I can erase away and fix things. Thanks. I hope you're having a good day so far, Andy. So there's an interesting. I don't know about this design if we're going to get it exactly, but I'm just going to wing it so it seems like something it goes straight and then has little curve at the bottom. Wish I could maybe make one of these and duplicated that might be smart. Thank you Ryan. I appreciate it. Take care, talk to you soon. Do you have an Instagram account? Yes, actually thank you, Ella. It's I think the link is below. In the description, yeah, it should be there. If it's not showing up or anything, just let me know and I'll post it in the chat. But thanks for asking. Alright, I'm going to duplicate that one layer that I made and we're just going to use that. 'cause I think that that would be way more accurate than me trying to draw the same curve at this over and over again. That's not going to happen. And maybe it will look. Charming. You know, sometimes it works when you. Mistakes, sometimes it can work. I do think maybe I should have duplicated it to be a little bit thicker. Alright, will merge all the. Details. Yeah, yeah, I can actually, I don't know that he does. He occasionally would stream on Twitch awhile back doing some UI design stuff. Things design things. But it's been awhile. So I don't have like any accounts. He doesn't have any accounts where he shares that stuff. If that changes all, I'll let you know. OK, so this is a little tedious, but here we go. We got our pattern. I think that was probably the better way to do it. For the sake of this matching properly. Alright, so I'm going to duplicate that and go to edit transform, flip horizontal so that we get that overlap design. That you see in the reference. Only I missed a couple on the side. Duplicate that edit transform, flip horizontal. Alright, cool. Yeah, of course I I got it. OK. Oh thanks project. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah, project project avoid posted my Instagram and chat. Thank you pastor. I'm happy that you feel the Sunny Vibes are coming through with this one. Alright, I want to erase out a little bit where these lines went above the fence. Alright, well we've got our fence. About too much drama. Oh, thank you John, thanks for being here. OK, so there's a few more things we need to do to get this feeling feeling finished. We're missing the tree, so the tree we gotta get the tree in an then. Uh. Well, that's the main thing. There's also I honestly don't know what this is over here. I don't know if it's like a mailbox or something, but there's something over here. We can kind of just put in the colour, there's like a Gray metallic thing here. We don't need to understand it, we just need to paint it. Alright, so we painted the thing we can come back to that later and like maybe. Do something else with it. But at least it's not orange. And. Match that down. Let's think about this tree on the left. So I will work on the branches 1st and I'm just going from the reference an roughly putting the branches where I think they should be. And we can make some decisions to if we think something is going to look better, we can change things up. I like to paint in an erase out when it comes to tree branches. Sometimes I find it hard to make natural looking tree branches. I don't know why but. It helps me to make a paint stroke and then use the eraser to erase part of it away and then it starts giving getting that a less perfect 'cause it when you're using a brush. It has like that perfect gradual thickness and when you erase away then you start getting some more of the natural randomness to the thickness of the branch. So I really like that. Oh, thank you I came, that's really sweet. I'm crazy. Basically. OK, so let's bring a couple of branches down here. And the reaching out. I'm not going to paint all of the branches in the reference. I think that would be a bit busy anyway. But just get some basic ones in. Honestly, that starts to look a little bit better, even with just the branches. Even without leaves, that's really helping. The area needed needed this tree. Fig tree. Try to get some branches going in different directions and not just in the same direction. Again, trying to fight my natural urge to. Make the same shapes over and over again. Keep it natural. OK, so we'll have that be the start of our tree. And then I'll make a new layer. Now this might be where I finally have to depart from this brush. I've been using the same brush for the whole painting, which is works pretty well, but these these leaves on this tree are. They've got interesting shape and they've got some sharp angles, so maybe I'll just start with it and see how it goes, but we might end up working with a little bit of a different shape brush. I think it's a door so they don't have to open the big gates all the time. Oh, that would make sense. Wow, my perception of scale is really weird. I didn't imagine that it was something you could actually walk through, but but it could be. That's cool. Looking at map French, it's a bit confusing. How does it work and how do you navigate the site? Oh, let me show you, I'll do like a quick demo. I'll do a quick demo 'cause I've learned a lot overtime about how to use it. OK, so. If you go to the view of the day is really nice today there's always a view of the day. OK, so when you go to the website? Oops. Um? If you click go so this is map crunch for anybody like what are we looking at. This website randomizes Google Street View images so it's good for finding random locations to paint. If you're wanting to do virtual Plein Air Painting so when you press go, you'll get a random place like in the world, so it could be anywhere and sometimes look at that. That's really pretty. I like this one. Yeah, you'll get sometimes it'll be like on the side of the road and sometimes it's nicer than others. You know, sometimes there are low res and you don't know what you're going to get, but you can also. You can go to the options and you can select a specific country if you want a certain look like if you want like tropical or feeling, or you know whatever country here you're looking for geography press, go and then you'll get an area in that specific country. You can also click the map here and then you can drag and drop this little person and then you'll get you'll end up in that area where ever you drop so you can find maybe specific areas that you want to paint and then you can go there and find something there. So all different kinds of stuff. And that's basically how I use it. There's some other things you can do down here when you when you're at the map, and I think the list has it too. Yeah, these settings down here you can select if you want like urban areas, indoor areas. Or if you want it to go on auto and that will make a slideshow for you and you can say how many seconds and it'll like automatically switch to a new location. So yeah, if you are looking for a cool places on there. Like I said earlier, if you use the map, you're more likely to find specific places that you might like want. You might want to paint if you just click go then you can get a lot of the side of the road but just still fun. It's kind of treasure hunt, but if you want to join my discord, if anybody is interested, you can. Click the link. I'll put it in the chat. We have a channel in my discord called virtual plein air, and we're always posting pretty places that we find on map crunch in there. So if you are like feeling like you're spending a lot of time not finding anything good. If you want to skip through that part of the process, you can just join our discord and search through that area like I can show you real quick. Please just ignore all my notifications and stuff, but in the discord you can just scroll back up. There's a lot of me and a lot of others in the community, like to post cool places we find with nice lighting or good composition or interesting places, and you can scroll up through these forever. It is a lot so. If you would rather do that than just aimlessly searching, there's some good ones here. We're always posting new ones. Yeah, you're welcome. I know what you mean. 'cause when I first started looking for references there, I was also like how are people finding good stuff? How is that happening? But yeah, that's how. That's how. Alright, so. That's also true sieve. Yeah, you can if you want to look for for actual photos. The thing is with map crunch is a lot of times the camera view because of the Google Street View car. The 360, the way that it takes the photos. It creates a lot of distortion with. Like sort of fish. I kind of looked. I personally don't mind it, and I've gotten used to it. But Some people really don't like that, so you can always go to other sources for photos, but I like the map crunch because I like the first of all. I like that there's like literally endless. I mean, well, I guess I shouldn't say Endless 'cause there is. There is a finite amount of photos there, but I mean it's the whole world. There is so much you're not going to run out of things to paint. And also it's good for expanding your visual library because there's you know architecture and geography from around the whole world and you might find things that you didn't know what interests you, so there's a lot of regions that I've come to appreciate more because of doing these. You know which is randomly ending up in an area and being like, wow, this is really pretty. Where is this? You know there's certain places that I've come to appreciate more because of that. I didn't really know what they look like before. So it's definitely some benefits to doing it. I'm not sure if I like this. Method for the tree. Yet I'm going to. And I'm going to keep going. Still will decide. Oh cool, yeah, you should be able to find some good stuff like that, and I know what you mean. I I also live really far away from my original. My original home and sometimes I like to go through there and look at pictures and places to paint and stuff like that. You know the feeling. So right now I'm painting the darker sort of background. Leaves that are in Shadow and then we're going to paint a lighter group. Groups of leaves that are getting hit by light. So by starting with the darker ones then we have some room to go lighter and give the idea of depth hopefully. Hopefully. Have an idea? I don't know if this is going to work. But I'm going to make a selection and then try to make a brushstroke. Yeah, that might work if you look at the shape of. These leaves are very interesting. I might be able to use the selection tool to make it possible for me to stick with this brush. I'm really trying to stick with this one brush. By Jackson. Thank you for painting with me. Thanks for hanging out. Yeah, this one is going to something else. Yeah, this could work though. Alright, I'm going to try it in a few other places, so I'm going to make a bunch of these little Piney selections. Make my brush stroke within that shape. Do that down here. And then whatever you want. Also, it's kind of fun. Yeah, there's a tree finally. Finally. OK. So. Let's make a new layer. I will start with some lighter greens. There really bright, actually. There's a lot of yellow. That looks good. So. My concern is this. I might have to do a lot of. Stuff like what I was just doing. OK, here's what we're going to do. We're going to step one, which is a little bit closer to this color. And let's create a little bit of a glow. Then we'll go with some really bright. Individual leaf shaped things. The idea. OK, it looks messy. Will see if it works. So now we make a new layer or we go even brighter and a little bit more yellow. So this should really stand out. And now we're going to focus on individual leaf shapes and the way it looks like this plant is. This tree is working is like there's a central area and then coming out from that. So let's try that. By Claire Z. Thank you for hanging out. I know I actually got to go to. This is going a little longer than I planned, so I'm going to try my best to get this tree finish up with the tree real quick and then. I got around here. But I enjoyed the enjoy the stream in the company today, you guys. I will be posting this. Probably here on Behance so I post a lot of what I do on Instagram and also on behalf, but I kind of try to save my better stuff for be hands so I don't post every single thing here. But you can always, uh, yeah there's a link to my Instagram below the stream in the description. And that's where you'll see a lot of my studies. Even some of the more the less polished ones. But I really like this one. I think it has potential, so I'll probably Polish it up a little bit more. Post stream. Maybe on another day when I have more time, but I wanted to show at least the end of the process of this tree. what I was going to try to do and I do like this enough. What I'm doing here with the tree that I think is worth it. It's a little bit time consuming compared to maybe taking, uh? Some kind of leaf brush and going in here, but hopefully it'll be worth it. So using the lasso tool to get a hard edge on top and then letting the brush randomly. Just end where ends on the bottom, so you get that nice sort of natural jagged edge like the leaves. We can try also just kind of painting it in with a smaller brush that might be faster even. So making a line and then. Yeah. This is a very busy tree, so something I notice leaves will have a couple different. By project thank you. Have a good rest of your day. When you're painting leaves, you guys, there's a couple of different effects that will happen. Sometimes you'll get light shining through the leaf and sometimes light shining off the leaf. So normally what I noticed is when there's light shining through the leaf, you get that beautiful like subsurface scattering effect, and the leaf will be really vibrant and like Super Green. It depends on the plant, but it would be very very saturated yellow, green and then sometimes. Um? Find Rainier. Sometimes you'll get light shining off, like reflecting off the leaves, and that will. That'll be more of a white light. So yeah, I'm not choosing colors for the. For the leaves here, it's going to be vibrant, saturated green for light shining through and then a couple areas will go with bright white light shining off the leaves. So. Alright, well I am sorry that I didn't get to finish this one. I have to admit I knew this one was a little ambitious from the start, but I thought we could do it and it ended up taking a long time because of the details and the architecture so I should probably practice at more of these scenes. Hopefully you guys don't hate them because we can do somewhere together, but will still keep doing natural scenes and other things. Maybe will do some portraits in the future too, so we'll keep trying to mix it up, but I think I'm like about out of time, so sadly I won't be able to get this to 100% of a finished state during stream today, but I'll try to finish it up soon and post it and share it, but most of what's happening from here to the end is going to be polishing, so spending a lot of time probably making leave shapes. And then going through and cleaning up little areas. And maybe maybe maybe tweaking some things. But it is close. We got most of it done. Got most of it done. I hope you guys enjoy the process. I really appreciate the company today and all the tips. I got some good. I learned a couple new shortcuts today so thank you. Thank you. Yeah, and these were our paintings for the day, so thank you for joining me, you guys. I appreciate it. Oh, thank you Ella. I will be back here every Wednesday. I might be able to sneak in some extra streams on other days if possible, but I'll definitely be here on Wednesdays an yeah if you guys want to share it. If anybody was painting along on the stream today and you didn't get a chance to share in the chat or you're still working on your painting, you're welcome to post it on social media and tag me. I would love to see it. Or you can post it in my discord. There's a link to my discord in the description below. And I think that's it. I don't know if I had any other announcements other than thank you guys are great. I hope you have a good rest of the day. Take care of yourselves. Thank you clever. Thank you Pamela. Thank you very much. Thanks for the nice comments of the company. You guys, I will see you next time. And yeah, enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks for hanging out. Love to see you do some portraits. This has been lovely. Thank you. Oh thank you. OK, that's good feedback. I will keep it in mind. I'll keep it in mind. Thank you, I will see you later.

What I'm trying to practice with it? I think one of the important things with this image is going to be simplification. I'm going to be trying to Simplify and organize what's going on here 'cause right now, it's just like chaos and I do want it to feel like? Something. So. It doesn't have anything there yet. The info tab doesn't have anything. Hum. Is that what you were talking about Mills? I. It's showing up on my end, but I can. Exit an do it again. Are my brushes showing there though? Let's see. Give me one moment you guys want to make sure that the references. Easily accessible for you. Let's take an extra second here. Hum. Um. The brushes showed OK I'm going to put it under the stream description. All right, so it's under the stream description as well in case the info tab doesn't work. That way. You can at least find it somewhere. OK. So let's get started here. R. Kelly says are going to be working on this one, the whole stream or is it a speed. I will be working on it, the whole stream so this will be probably around 4 hour painting. I've been spending around 3 to 4 hours on these paintings. On these streams and just working on one painting for the whole time. Thank you my love. I wonder why yeah, some of the. Things that I've been added entering on. On my end haven't been yeah, there, we go OK mails that should be good now. Alright. Sorry guys were having a little a couple little tech things but I think we're good now. So my. My canvas size is. 3000 by around yeah around 3000 by 1900 pixels. Let's just make that 3000 by 2000. I like to be a nice round Number. OK. So. All of this on the other monitor. Alright and I'm also going to use pure ref to put the reference image up here just so you can. See what I'm working on. What does the 72 resolution mean? Resolution Oregon. Like DPI, That has to do with the image image size? How many pixels per inch. They your images when you're working with the web images. Normally you'll work in 72 resolution if you want ever print something out. You want it to be in 300 Resolution 300 DPI that's going to be better quality for printing. So it depends on what your goals are with the artwork. What kind of size. You want to make it. Um if you are planning to print something out you probably want to work in 300. DPI and make sure that just make sure that the image is large enough. In the end, the most important thing is that you just have enough pixels if you have uh. If you have a 10,000 by 10,000 size image pixel image at 72 resolution well. That's fine. There's still plenty of pixels. You can switch it to 300 and print it out and it's going to be fine. But Long story short if you make a small if you're looking if you set things up as inches or centimeters for example. And you want to let's say you want to make an 8 by 10 print of something you set it up like this. 8. By 10 inches. S 72 if you want to print out an 8 by 10 print of your image. It's not going to look good. You need to make sure that this is 72 mean that this is 300 not 72. If you want it to be a nice print. That being said, if you switch all of this to pixels. You'll see that this is all in your image size. Menu here, the way the photo shop does this, if you switch between pixels inches centimeters. It's going to. Automatically calculate it for you so if you have. 72 resolution. Size document with these. Dimensions and you go to pixels. It's going to tell you how many pixels it is so. I don't know if that I don't know if that helps I don't know if that answers your question. But basically if I wanted to make some if I wanted to see like 300 by 200. If I put this too. C300. Yeah, it's You can look into it just just read up on it. There's tons of information about this. It's definitely something that's uh like basic important thing to understand if you're getting into digital painting. Story short Photoshop makes it pretty easy, but you want to make sure that you. If you're going to, if you want to print something out. You need to make sure you have enough pixels. I need to make sure it's 300 DPI. OK let's get into painting. Um. Yeah, the only reason I think I confused at more, but there's like a common misconception. I'm going to save my file and then will start being thing. There's a common misconception that just putting something in 300. DPI means you're good to go and you can print it nicely. If you still make a small file at 300. DPI that doesn't help you that much lower just keep in mind like? The overall pixel size is important too. Up. So this is in Malaysia. Malaysia waterfall that's what we'll call this. Alright so if anybody wants to join in with painting this, you're welcome to take the reference image from. Below the description and do a study with me, I'd love to see what you do, I'm going to explain? My. Process as I go and if you have any questions, you can let me know. Hi there or not I. Welcome. OK so I want to try to break this down into something that's a little bit more easy to understand. An I can give some tips really quick some things that I do to the reference image sometimes to help study it before I. Even get going with painting. Sometimes I'll turn the reference into black and white and take a look at it like this and see if I can. Take any extra steps to understand the value structure. So for example. I'm going to paint on Top of my reference on another layer really quick. So. If I look at some areas where there's already shadows. I can decide if I want to block off a darker area. There, too, like what do you want your value structure to be an can we exaggerate it like? There's light bright light coming through here, so there's like a triangle type shape in the middle and then. Around at that there's some shadows is kind of what I'm seeing. And maybe so maybe something like that is. Like roughly To what I see when I'm looking at this so. Sometimes exaggerating those things can help how can we live stream on Behance I think you can request. Is there not a pop up for you? When you log in? I know for a while that was showing up when you log in and you're you're on your account. There's like a pop up like would you be interested in? Streaming and you can request the permission for that, if you don't see something like that. I'm not exactly sure. I don't know maybe there's a contact. I'll have to ask maybe how I can help with that for next. Next stream, I didn't expect to get that kind of question and I actually don't know the answer. I'm sorry and I'll die but maybe you can contact someone at the hands. Um. I was invited to stream here. So that's how I got started but I'm not sure where you should go to do that. Maybe there's a contact button somewhere here on the site that you can. You can ask for help. Um. So far, everyone I worked with at the House has been super helpful so I think if you message them, they will. They will answer you. OK, so. I'm going to start with the horizon line sketching that in where it roughly where I predict the horizon to be. Hi son how are you welcome? And. For me, I'm going to put that sort of it like the line, where the water from the rocks on the waterfall come together something. Like this. An I'm just going to sketch loosely. I'm not worried about my sketch looking great, it's just kind of. Get warmed up and look around. Um at the composition make some decisions on where things are going to go. We have some trees up here. Alright so. I'm going to do another sketch, you can do separate thumbnail sketches as well, and save them and keep them separately. But for me here, I'm probably just going to do a couple sketches and see what I like so there's a pool of water in the center. Surrounded by rocks, I might change some things about the composition to make a more pleasing seen here. I don't want it to feel flat. I think one thing that will help is keeping this waterfall. A little bit more in the distance whoops accidentally painted on that here. Hi go Boo. How are you? We have some rocks over here. That are closer. And then there's a log like a fallen tree here. Coming across. For those of you who are painting along I hope you have a good time with this reference I. I know it's a difficult one. Feel free to change things if you see any opportunities to make the composition were interesting for yourself. If you want to go along if you want to, if anything that I do is helpful you're welcome to. To make any of those changes. But I'm just going to try to make sense of this is the most I can one of the reasons that I picked this reference was because. Yeah, it was a busy one with a lot of foliage. An these are the type of scenes that. While I love how they look at, I sometimes struggle with organizing. What's going on in the scene and understanding it? So. Um. Why are there so many trolls today Jesus? Um there's a pop up line in the left hand side asking our interest in life. Thank you go Boo OK. I'm glad it's showing up for some of you. OK. So let's continue. Sorry about that you guys. So let's have a relaxing let's have a relaxing painting session. Some people sadly don't understand the artistic process. But don't be discouraged. Just have fun with it. As you guys know who watch my paintings regularly I don't. I don't value the. Being a perfectionist with the sketch sketch is not. Um. The point of a sketch is not to to look beautiful, but to plan to brainstorm to think. Uh that's OK Mills that's night, it's not your fault. Good luck Jackson I'm yeah, I'm so sorry for picking such a difficult one. But I know you enjoy challenge so. All right. So anyway like I was saying the whole point of sketches to just think through what you're going to do compositionally. Make some plans for how the scene is going to look. You really don't want to get caught up in being perfectionist about this? What about illustrator. What reason you choose photo shop. Illustrator is great for really clean designs and vector type things but I mostly paint, Indiana rasterized format. I like to. Yeah, I have a lot of blending and textures in my painting and so it's better for me to paint it photo shop. It's just like the type of art that I'm doing is easier. To work with photo shop for it. There's a lot of tools specifically for painting and kind of mimicking. Um. Mimicking. Traditional brushes and there's things like the mixer brush. Stuff like that is really nice to. Nice to work with so. Uhm you on high bear. I'm sorry. I can't read what you wrote in the chat. If you can speak English. Please do because otherwise I can't sadly communicate with you. Thank you for translating Mills thank you. Thank you. You want I'm sorry if I'm saying Your name right, but thank you for the comment. OK, so. I think this is enough of a sketch to for me to have an idea of what I'm going to do. And let's be brave let's just get started. I think this is one of those scenes that I'm going to have to figure it out with shapes. I don't think that we can really. Make a line drawing that's going to clean everything up for me, yeah, I think we're going to just start painting. Anne will clean things up as we go. So. And lower the opacity lock the. Layer. And. I think I will pick a warm underpainting type color so. When I from painting the painting I don't always choose the exact same type of. The exact same type of workflow for something like this, because it's so messy and textured and there's it's. Yeah, there's just a lot going on, I want my painting to feel. To have a variety of textures. I wanted to have like an underlying warmth. Even though there's a lot of green and some cool colors. There's a lot of warmth here. So I think we're going to go with the sort of traditional painting kind of approach and see how that takes us. So I'm going to do something that you see a lion traditional painting, which is create an underpainting. So let's try that. So I'm going to pick a color that's something remotely similar to a burnt Sienna. And I'm just going to paint in the background to get rid of the white canvas. I can also choose a brush that has. Um. Color dynamics color dynamics is a brush setting that. You can play with the huge jitter saturation jitter brightness jitter. Check color dynamics on your brush palette when you make a brush stroke. With each stamp of the brush is going to slightly change the color there and this can be kind of cool. I mean look. It's a little trippy, but it gives it gives a lot of Hue variation and if you're going for a traditional look. Nice maybe at first, it looks weird. But once we start building up the painting. That's very cool. So. The thing that I think I. Missed an underpainting stage in the past, is that it's not only about putting a solid color back in there. You can actually use underpainting to start figuring out a little bit of your value structure also and this is something that I never have really done before and I saw it in a? In a demo that the underpainting can also be used to plan out value structure so. So, just a little bit. I will use this underpainting too. To paint in that triangle? You know, we're going to have some light coming through the. The trees up at the tops shining down hitting the water here. And this is the main shape that we see, there's also going to be some. You can do it. Pretty good. Alright, let's. Shadows. Shrink down the screen so that all of you can see what I'm doing. And I'm using a brush that doesn't get I mean, it's very, very big very textured, but we're not getting into detail. Now at all, so you can see. Get it into a window size that will fit this stream. Just the beginning stages. Just like that. And I'm going to make this window a little bit bigger than this one. Alright so this is on you. I'm going to make just a little smaller. Experiment for me, I haven't painted like this before with this exact. Like so I'm going to get rid of a couple of. Workflow with the underpainting so. We'll see how it works. Panel so they don't need. Don't need the brushes right now. So, just a little bit of the value structure, OK, so I'm going to merge that down to the background. Alright cool, so this is going to be where will spend? So we basically have this crazy layer. And then a layer with our sketch. Probably the rest of the evening before we do that. I'm going to make a new layer on Top of this one and then we're actually going to start. Let's also I'm going to bring this back up. The painting here so. Like so. Let's do it, I think. Alright, will take one less look at our good old friends illustrator. I think I'd like to start with a brush that gives a little bit more. Save this other file. And will quit out of illustrator. Clear that clipboard. A little bit more. We don't need it. And let's get started in after effects. I'm sorry. Which is now not displaying. What's the word like a foundation sharp edges, blocking in that's what I want to do? So let's fix that. There we go. Um. OK so I have after effects arranged a little bit differently than than you may be used to seeing it so by default when you open it, you're going to see a layout that's a little more similar to this where your composition, your work area kind of takes up most of the space you got your timeline on the bottom. So I'm going to grab it grey. And start roughly painting in some rock shapes now if you can't see your sketch anymore like with me. I'm just going to go and up the opacity of the sketch layer. And then your project and all your project files on the left and a lot of your other controls and inspectors to the right. A little bit so I can see it better again. Some of the darker things in the background and made it more difficult. When you're rigging, you want to have really easy access to your timeline to your layer list, as well as to your composition so that you can actually look at the character value rigging. When using underpainting you don't use any brushes that don't have transfer. Um that doesn't really mean anything to me like whether it has transfer or not, that's just a coincidence Mills like that, they happen to do. But I also want to have access to a plug in that plugin is duyck vassal, I think is how it's pronounced. Have it or not have it the only thing that matters really is. Let me show you really quick the beautiful. The result of the underpainting does it will call you want? Do it website. But like whether or not the brushes have transfer doesn't really matter. If you are not familiar, duyck is a plugin for after effects. That's just a personal preference thing. It is free. This is an open source tool which is pretty incredible when you think about what it's capable of, but do it is a. Really, really in depth animation and rigging tool for after effects. Hi there Tomas. I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22 with a stylus. Again you can download it for free. Not a mouse so I'm drawing on the screen. I've included a link to the plugin in the stream description below this video. So if you want to check out do it. Go for it. It would be really difficult to do with the mouse because I use a lot of brushes that have pressure sensitivity. It's amazing and it's free, so why not check it out and learn it. The learning curve is a little bit sleep. So it's really helpful to be able to draw on a tablet. I've only just started experimenting with it and even in this stream we're going to scratch the very, very surface of what this tool is capable of doing. You don't have to have a screen tablet of course. But having a tablet with pressure sensitivity makes it a lot easier to do this kind of painting. But it is. It is so cool how easy it makes the reading process, how easy it's going to make creating a walk cycle. So, just blocking in some. It's amazing. I'm so pumped about this thing and I want to learn. More and more about it, but this is the do it Basil site. Rocks early stages. I've already installed this, but it is available for oh don't re download it. At this point, it's not really going to look like anything but you gotta trust that workflow go through the motions. I know you want to. OK there we go cool. Until. You can download it for a variety of platforms. That's that's important thing about having a workflow like even though I haven't done this underpainting before basically now that that's done, I'm going to my normal workflow, which is. And installing it is just a simple a simple rather as installing any other. You know painting in the big shapes first relatively beginning with a mid tones and then, adding shadows and highlights. After effect plugin it goes into your script UI folder. Once you've restarted, you have this. This panel right here. Um. So this is the do it panel. It has so so much in it so you can see here that there are rigging tools there. So it's important to it's important to have a workflow or just like a way that you kind of look at order in which you do things and it's OK. Automation tools that you can use to help with animation. If it changes like for me. The rigging tools allow you to create all different types of rigs for all different types of characters that can go from really simple human like characters that have structures like two legged humanoids all the way to four legged creatures and beyond kind of the Sky is the limit with what you want to build. My workflows change a lot of noise. Experimenting with new ones. But it does help like in the early stages of the painting. Do you like have a sort of method that you go through that makes sense. Interest in upgrading this skill for my next works nice if you have any questions, you can let me know. With the rigging tool. So I want to look in black-and-white repeatedly as I go. Then there are all sorts of other animation tools that are a part of this and automations to speed up your work. You can set this up as a shortcut for yourself. If you want to set that up, you can go to view. There is an in depth camera tool. Proof set up. There are also like all sorts of utilities that will help clean up animations and simplify work that you need to do. Custom and then under proof conditions set the device to simulate to working great gain 20% and then press OK. It's just amazing so. Mines already set up. I'm excited to get started in this. And so at once you do that every time you press control why it's going to turn your painting into black and white. And you can just take a quick look at it and then turn it back another really handy thing about this. Is wallets in black-and-white you can color pic and paint an it will color pic and paint in color? Um so you can paint in the black and white mode and then go back to color and yeah, it's really, really cool. If you this is. This is something unique to photo shop that I use all the time. OK, so. Yeah, we're going to add some foliage next and I'm going to just try to start blocking in greens. Just so we get the overall overall. Green in the right place. So we want some more blue greens notice in the shadows. The leaves type kind of tend a little bit more towards. Blue green and in areas that are having a splash of light, hitting them. The greens become more saturated and yellow green and vibrant green. So I'm painting with a really large brush right now as you can see it's nice to start with a larger brush. And then Get more specific as you get into details of your painting. This is something that I do when I'm doing traditional painting. And I've tried to do it in digital also. Start with a larger brush and try to kind of use a larger brush for as long as you can. To get some nice. Queen shapes. Now the background, the Sky in this case is really, really light. Light blue maybe I mean in the reference. It looks almost white because I think just the exposure of the photo. But we can make it. A little bit more actually light blue. You can download my brushes if you want them. Thomas you can just check the info tab. Above the chat. I've collected brushes an made some of my own. Over the course of 6 years. Of doing digital painting. OK. You're welcome, I hope you like them. I change my brushes often because. I don't know I like trying new brushes there fun to play with and fun to make so I often. Uh-huh. I often change up my. My brushes. All right. So I think I will merge this down. I mean, even though it looks a bit like a hot mess at the moment. Um we're kind of on track for. This, as far as this workflow how I expect things to. To look at this stage? We can start bringing in some darker values. Some shadows and that will start to give shape to things here. I have some good brushes are never too much. Yeah, exactly that's how I feel you can always try some extra brushes. So I I have lately just fallen in love with putting purple in the shadows. When I'm painting it's something that I notice. Does exist in real life? Maybe I exaggerated a little bit but purple and blue especially on a nice? Sunny day is something that you will notice in the shadows that will have. Bounce light and They will have that kind of effect. They will have a little bit of. Tint of blue. Or purple. And it's just a little bit of a nice variation, the little bit more fantasy type of feeling. Even though we're painting, something that's real and what I've seen with a waterfall. We can still make it feel a little bit more special. A little bit more. You know fantastical. We can just you know exaggerate as artist you can exaggerate what you like. About the scene. So we have, I was going to do a 3 to 4, probably 4 hour stream today, depending on how? You know faster painting goes and I want to get the painting to a nice finished polished place by the end of the day. So. Let's see let me see what time it is. Alright so we have a lot of time left. We're just at the beginning here so we should be able to get this looking good and it's nice to. It's nice to be able to spend a little bit more time on one of these. I do a lot of very quick studies. And I. Don't get a chance to indulge in the details as much so for this one. It will be nice to get things cleaned up. As we zone in more and more as the painting goes on will be able to. Turn this abstract scene into something. Alright so maybe I should have saved the other layers just so I could have made like A. Step by step, she will start now saving the layers as we go through so you can kind of see how it builds up. Also thanks for coming over everybody. I hope you have a good day and that you enjoy the stream. If you have any questions, you can let me know. So I think one thing that would really benefit would be to. Figure out The lighting. Would be to start establishing that? The whole value structure, Hey, Bros welcome. How are you doing? Oh no worries. No worries, I'm trying a technique today. That is something more what's done in the traditional painting and I'm kind of trying to digital? Version of that, so it's going to be a good experiment. It's uh. Basically, I made more of an underpainting like what you might see in A. I could wash or oil painting. And I'm trying that out. But yeah, if you want to check out the reference. You can look below the stream as always. Icing thank you welcome. Welcome. It's very nice of you. Hope you're having a good day. So these Brooks here have little splashes of light on them and that's going to help start establish the. Establishing the shapes of individual rocks. And letting us be able to see that there. They have some form. Hi Maria's. Welcome. I'm looking for a color to add some shadow to the rocks, but they don't get very dark. There's a couple areas that have shadow, but mostly the. The rocks here they are, they're pretty light. They're getting hit by there in the lightest part of the painting. So even the areas of the rocks that are darker, they're not very, very dark. There to learning welcome if you have any questions, you can let me know. I'm also learning. And. And teaching what I do know I'm happy to, I'm happy to share whatever I do know. Ann. Also learning as well. One of my favorite ways to learn is just try new things. Thiago's Never tried this before, but after watching you working I'm definitely going to try Oh that's cool to hear. Thanks. I have seen a few a few painters working this way. Over the last. Year so that I started to really look into digital. Landscape painting and Plein air painting and yeah, digital and traditional. And it's been interesting to see how you can bring traditional techniques into. Digital painting. And get a different feel. So want to zoom out on my reference really quick an. I didn't recreate the rocks exactly as they are in the reference and I'm trying to decide. If that's if that's a problem or not for me like I'm trying to decide how important it is. That the rocks are where they are in this reference and I don't think it's so important. As long as the composition feels nice and the rock shapes believable. So I'm going to. Stick it easy, see where it goes. How do you choose in which style you're going to do your stuff hi Anna? Thank you brother thank you. Um a lot of a lot of what I choose comes from. I like to watch a lot of tutorials. Other live streams. I like to follow artists on different social media platforms. I like to go for. Yeah, if if if someone's having a workshop. I like to try to attend workshops when I can. And so basically I see different processes and it makes me curious to try them and so today for example. I saw this reference an I thought the scene looked like something that would make sense to try a more traditional. Painting style so I decided to try that. But yeah, it definitely comes a lot of my inspiration definitely comes from seeing other artists work. Thank you go Boo. All right uhm, I wonder. Maybe maybe I can turn off my sketch layer soon. As I think earlier my sketches really just too. Roughly plan out where things are going to go. Ask the question of previous post will OK things are scrolling up very fast for me. Mill says sorry for answered this before trying to understand underpainting process. I was wondering if the brushes, too, opaque that the underpainting wouldn't show at all. Um. It depends on the person how light or dark you want the underpainting to be so in opaque brush. Um. Might be. Fine or not fine. It's all personal preference does that make sense Mills. Like it's not a right or wrong or too opaque or not opaque like. Because it's a personal preference thing of how you want it to be. Um. Yeah. Like people have different intentions. Some people do very light under paintings and just looked into the paper a little bit. And other people want to figure out the whole value structure. Also, the whole underpainting thing is still knew to me and I'm experimenting with it and trying to learn as I go so. I'm sorry if I don't have all the answers with it, but As far as to my knowledge that's the best answer I can give you. Um can you show the final so I'm going to be finishing this one today, but it's going to be a few more hours, I might be. Yeah, it might be up to 3 hours more. Danylo I'm going to be streaming for get probably around 3 more hours. It's hard to predict exactly I'm going to stream. The amount of time it takes to finish this painting and so it could be 2 1/2. It could be 3 1/2, but somewhere around there is how long I think it will. Take. Um Mills, one more thing. About your question really quick. I want to take a little detour and I don't know if this information helps anyone else as well, but just in case it might. Um. Mills I'm going to make a new, blank layer pretend this is the background layer. Let's say you want your. Let's say you want your background to be OK, so this is how I'm using it Mills. If I want the background layer if I have an idea in my head that I want the background layer to look like this. Like this is the color I want. Uhm I can use. Any number of brushes to get to that point, I can either taken a brush that is see-through. And paint that. I can either take a brush that is 100% opaque paint that exact color or maybe I could take. A later. A brush that is see-through or you know, and and paint less. Light and still end up with close to the same color. It's a weird thing with opacity it's like. So right here. This was this was a color that I painted by selecting a much darker color and painting lightly. But I can also color pic from this choose a fully opaque brush. And paint at 100% Opacity If I remove the background or if I change the background color. You'll see the difference. It doesn't matter if the brushes opaque or not only matters, the end result of the color that you get. And you can get it multiple ways, so like selecting the exact color that you want the exact shade you want. Or selecting maybe a darker one and then painting it like a little bit lightly does that make sense. All thanks you guys, sometimes it's hard to answer or understand certain questions 'cause. I think you know when we're dealing with like visual. Things and then trying to answer the question in words. Sometimes they're going to be understanding. So I hope that I eventually answered a question and then it makes sense what I'm saying. But as far as like, what I was planning to do this is the first painting that I've done. Using this attempting this technique, so I don't really know what I'm doing. Like in the bottom example the dark grey was showing through a bit, yeah, exactly it doesn't matter because I'm going to merge it down to the bottom to the background layer. And then it's going to become. Under percent opaque and. Whatever whatever color it is it is. So. Get a little bit more vibrant greens up here. Doing pretty well thanks thank you. So these trees are coming out from the Bush is basically there partially covered. So we'll have them will have a little bit of the tree trunks showing. Hello I'm from China high welcome thanks for joining. So far I'm basically using 1 brush for this painting, I did the underpainting using a different brush, but I could have used this one and. If you're under painting is covered anyway, so if you're interested in what brush I've been using the whole time. At this point, it's basically the rectangle texture brush in my brushes pack. Back Adele Hello there. So I am starting to work with a little bit smaller brush. I don't know if you guys. Yeah. If you're following along or listening in but right now, I'm. I'm I'm moving on to a smaller brush same brush, but just. Making it a little bit. More easy for me to go into some details here. All thanks heroes. Hi Tanner, I thought about I've had requests to have a Camera also on my hand while I'm painting. Maybe someday, I will do it, but it's a little complicated to set up an. Also I don't know how I would feel being. So many cameras around me the whole time. But maybe maybe it can happen. But thanks for the nice comment. So the rocks over here on the right have some more shadows and shapes to them that it would be nice to establish. I feel like I'm procrastinating on it, a little bit. This kind of stuff I feel like it takes a little bit more brainpower for me, I have to actually. Think about geometry or something you know looking at the shape figuring it out. Where's the light hitting with direction? Is it facing and? Really figure out the angles. You can look at the info tab above the chat and you should be able to find a link to my brushes there. And I hope that you enjoy them You betrayed him out. Every once in awhile I update my brushes pretty often actually 'cause I like to play with new ones. Right so this rock is almost all in shadow with just the other edge, having late hit it and maybe I can. Pop in a little bit of light 22. Show that. Goodnight start using a little bit of a Brown on the rocks too. I don't know if I like that flash of light. I'm going to take it off for now and. Maybe I'll add it back in later. OK, so knew layer. One of the areas that has the highest contrast. Is over here on the right? Hi Abby, It is it is relatively new. The the streaming. Capabilities here on Behance Leica. Relatively new platform. But it's really nice. I've been enjoying it. I've been doing. The photo shop integration. There's some cool things for example, if you. If you watch the video later. See I had this an earlier I'm going to turn it on again. I don't know if once I click it if it's staying on or? Now, what's happening. I'm going to need to check this every once in awhile as I go so there's a tool timeline. I did turn it on at the beginning of stream. And. Basically, if you go back and watch the VOD at the end or the if you watch the video after the stream. It will have recorded the. It will have recorded the actions that I'm taking like the specific brushes that I'm using and stuff as well as well. Some of the specific brushes, but the tools. The photo shop tools. So it's very cool. There's some things like that that. That are very nice. OK, so. There's a tree over here that kind of sprouts up from in between the Roxanne has a cool silhouette. Now I wonder Yeah, I'm going to paint I'm going to keep this. Tree on its own layer at least temporarily. So for example, if I turn the layer on and off you can see it. Hello Welcome, If you guys have any questions, let me know. But we are in the early stages of a painting here, we've got a few hours left to go. So hopefully we're going to see a good transformation in this by the end. But painting and ice. Waterfall scene. Nice relaxing landscape environments, Hi Victor. And if anybody is joining stream now and you like the reference in your interested to paint it the streams. These studies that I do on stream. They are Group Studies. Anyone is welcome to join in and paint. This scene with me so if you like. The reference you can find the link below the description. And you can paint it with me if you like an you're welcome to share your work share what you do. It's really nice to see a bunch of people study the same reference because you'll get. So many different you'll get different styles interpretations ideas of how to approach things. Everton high thank you. That's very nice of you. So I'm trying to get this tree an interesting shape. I like how this one branch separates a little bit more. And then it comes down to join in with the others. OK, so another thing. That the level of darkness of this tree the value, the shading of the tree around it. Those rocks have? About the same. Amount so I need to darken what I have here and start establishing more the individual rock shapes and. Adding The Shadows, where they need to be. Yes, Sir I thank you. Thank you. And then some of these lighter rocks, well, maybe they're not actually lighter, but there. Reaching out into the sunlight, so. They are appearing a lot lighter. So I think one thing that I'm missing out on is this rock right here. It actually has a little bit of space. This rock structure, I should say there's a little bit of space in between. This rock and then uh one that is. Kind of leaning over on another one. There's there's a little bit of space where we see the green background. I'm going to zoom in on the reference a little bit. Let's see if I can understand what's going on here? I might actually make this. This rock project up a little bit what's happening? Is there's The Rock is being supported. But we can't really see from our angle like how it's being supported so I think for the viewer it's more. Coming to look at if we see that that rock is like resting on another rock instead of floating. I think it just like it makes more sense to us. So I'm going to change things up. So that that is nice to look at. So. If I Then go back a few steps we went from this to this to this. And it's starting to look like you know, we're starting to be able to tell what's going on here a little bit. You know that there's rocks and trees and. What kind of seeing this is from going from abstract to something that we can understand? So this log has a bright. Bright Patch of the light hitting the Top. And I want to include it, but I might wait a little bit longer, it's a bit distracting. So. Maybe it will be a little bit longer. Well, I hope you guys are doing well and if you're listening in working on any art projects or anything yourself, I hope. Hope you're having a good time. It's going well. I'm going to add a little bit more overlapping rocks, there's some that. I think would give a nice effect here of. For shortening overlapping and coming towards us might. Sell the perspective a little bit more. OK. I hope I'm not going to regret this. I really want to merge this layer down. But. Not very good English. Well, you're doing OK I could read that just fine just uhm. I appreciate you trying. I'm sorry I can't speak your language so. I have to. I have to speak English. Yeah. Let me know in English what I can call you because they don't know how to read your name. I'm sorry. Think emails. Before I merge down that tree. I'm going to put a little bit of shadows behind. It just because I feel like it's going to be easier for me. Um. Let's see Otavio Hi Mattie, I'm from Brazil. What table digitizer do use. I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22. Tablet. So I have a stylus I'm painting on the screen. And. Yeah, I think if you have any other questions. Let me know I think that's why you're asking. But it is a screen tablet. This painting is probably going to get a little bit darker before it gets lighter because I tend to like to add the shadows 1st. For highlights. OK so I'm going to merge that down. My name is Lynn OK Hi Lynn welcome. Thank you. Like you should write a FAQ yeah, maybe I should. Maybe should I don't mind answering them, though. You guys are welcome to ask me. So I'm just going to play with modifying the. The Rock and the the log here, I just. I don't really love this combination. Of shapes yet. Hey Ahmed welcome. Thanks for joining us. I just find that one rock to be seeming out of place. Do you work in an office no? I work from home. I'm doing basically full time streamer and artists. I don't work for a specific studio or anything like that. Just freelance. Um, I'm not taking commissions. I'm actually just full time streaming I stream here and I also stream on Twitch. And uh. Yeah, that's that's what I do as a cell Prince of my artwork and I'm going to be selling. My original traditional paintings. I'm also traditional painter. That's what I do. Maybe in the future, I will take commissions. I have in the past with the moment I'm just focusing on streaming. And uh my community on discord. We are doing a lot of. Group projects together studying and learning. Um let's see Maddie Otavia was asking about your brush, but it got scrolled up OK sorry about that. Being a little fast. This brushes native from photo shop. Uhm yeah, this brush is not a default brush. You can download it, though for free if you go to the info tab. Above my. Above the chat you can just download the brushes that I'm using. And this one is called? Rectangle texture. That's the brush. OK, so I think I like these rocks, a little bit better. Maybe I just won't include that one that's Kind of stacked over. Um. Solid I don't know if I say your name right solid or Sally. Thank you very much for the nice comments. I really appreciate that thanks for watching the streams and I'm glad you're enjoying. A lot of you know, my name on Twitch is just Maddie, it's just Maddy. And you can also, if you join my discord server, you can get more information. I will post that in the chat right now. Buttom. I'm streaming here at the same time every. Wednesday so. For anybody. Looking too. You know. Join again sometime and see my schedule here on Behance that would be Wednesdays at. 12:30 I was little late today. But 12:30. CET so that would be about. Yeah, like around an hour and 15 minutes ago I think around the time we started. I'm going to take a little break from painting the rocks for a bit and work on some of the foliage. I like to sort of bounce around the painting and make sure that nothing gets too, polished without. Um. Other areas you know, I don't want any areas to really fall behind so we're going to work on the foliage a little bit, just block in some more colors. Maybe then we'll go back to the rocks or maybe work on the water a little bit too. But I kind of want to. Move everything together towards a place of being finished. That really helps being able to visualize the whole scene together and make decisions about the mood the like the values. The colours and the lighting and everything. But I really like all the different greens. There's so many different shades of Green. That's a really beautiful thing about this kind of setting. And one of the things that I love about painting natural scenes well, I guess specifically in the summertime. When everything is nice and green. Thanks, you breath. So I'm getting closer to the level of detail where I might start switching from this brush to A. Brush that actually has. That I can be more specific with so for example, over here, I'm just going to start. Brushing in the very, very basic shapes of some of these. Branches coming out from the. This foliage on the left so painting with A larger brushes, making it easier for me to group the shapes together. So instead of painting coming in and doing like these individual leaves. We're going to save that for later. Right now we're just putting the overall shapes of the branches and then we'll go back an put some individual leaves and things when we go to the next level of detail. Oh, that's so nice thank see Bruce. And a thank you. Thank you. So I've been painting in a very sort of traditional type. Manor at this point, I do love to use layer blending modes and stuff like that in my art and I will definitely be using them. Even though we're painting in a very traditional manner. I will still go and grab me some color Dodge at some point. Or you know multiply to a fixed some shadows and things will get there. Will get there? Right now we're still just blocking everything in. And hopefully I'm going to be able to get it as close as I can to how I want it to look. But. Anything that doesn't go. Now I want we can edit it with some layer blending modes or just things we want to push further. It's a nice thing. So we have some rocks here in the foreground. Sometimes for ground. Things can be confusing in these virtual Plein Air Paintings. Interests ear lighting. Thanks, we will we will definitely be getting to it in a little bit as soon as like the. Yeah, I think basically we need to go around. Bottom area here and do some work. And then we'll go and do some. Some lighting some layer blending modes and kind of boost up the lighting a bit and then continue painting. I like to go back and forth between painting on normal layer and using layer blending modes. Because I feel like sometimes it can look a little unnatural if you just go in there with color dodgen. Bannon leave it. It's nice to work work it in so that it ends up looking a little bit more like. Like it was hit like painted in that way. Mills has a blue check because of Yeah, a moderate are for the channel that's why. So this rock is actually going under the water here. And this is the water can be a little bit darker. So we've got a couple of rocks here coming out of the. How's the water? It looks better. And I liked that Gray. I think some of these rocks, we can add a little bit more of a natural colored Gray. I do like purple in the shadows, but at the same time. Want to feel like a rock an be recognizable. So I flipped my canvas if you're wondering why it's opposite all of a sudden. I just flipped it so I could get a fresh look at what I'm doing it helps when you flip your canvas. Um. Sometimes it will point out to your mistakes you'll just be able to notice them. I Simon. Is the photo shop yes it is? I have a plug in for the color wheel, so maybe that's why it looks a little bit different. But yeah, it is photo shop right now, I'm working with CC. 19. Does your brush have a jitter it? Does yeah it has a huge it are if you go to color dynamics? It has Hue saturation brightness shooter. I've been experimenting with that a lot lately and I really like it, I mean, it can definitely be. Be too much sometimes but overall, I think it adds. A sort of traditional look at some happy accidents. You know you get little colors, you don't expect sometimes. Sometimes it's nice sometimes not. But I think it makes a little bit of a traditional type of look to the painting. Scipio hi welcome, thanks for being here. So this rock has a little bit of a darker. Side here with some Moss or mold growing. Will add that 'cause it's interesting texture? If anybody is just getting here welcome you can find information below the stream description about what I'm painting. And if you would like to join if you like the scene and you want to paint it, you can take the reference. And. Join in and feel free to share with me what you do if you decide to paint it. There are some rocks under the water here. And. I don't really know how I'm going to deal with that, yet. This area is a little bit of a puzzle for me right now. In the extended this rock a little bit further. One thing that I notice happens sometimes in my painting is I sort of accidental E. Paint repeating shapes like for example, these rocks here. Is very easy for me to? Paint a rock and then think to myself, well, not thinking actually but just painting you suddenly start to make each rock look the same. It's In nature, everything has these subtle little differences. Write an slightly different shapes and that's what makes it beautiful and everything is not the same. So I want to make this rock bigger. And maybe a little bit more pointed or elongated. And the one below here. You know, let's let's make it a little different shape. Not so much the same. Now Sir thank you. Thank you welcome. Also I'm probably getting too sucked in with all the rock shapes over here. We don't need to get so detailed because there's going to be a lot of foliage covering up this area anyway. But I wanted to give it a good foundation. And then we'll paint on Top of it, but yeah, we will be adding. We will be adding. Leaves and stuff on Top of it. OK, so. There's a little bit of a waterfall. And I am tempted to add more. To the waterfall than what they're actually is like I'm going to do this on another layer just for. Uh. Just for testing it out. But I wonder if we could add another rock up here. Maybe one that's That's higher up and. You know we could have. Like a rock leaning against here. I think it might be interesting to have a taller shape in the middle. It's it's pretty the way it is the reference itself is a beautiful place. You're waiting for the waterfall me too. I'm actually getting ready for it because I think. Maybe it would be nice to have the waterfall coming from a little bit higher. Starting point. 'Cause I'm playing with that idea. Let me flip this. Yeah, so something like this, it can be a rock. Meaning against these and maybe it's coming out from the shadows and we don't really see what's going on over there. So we'll just put it coming out from the leaves and things. Leave shadows under here. Hi duos, How are you? Now I'm just adding all kinds of rocks. Let's try, though let's try. Going to leave that as it is for the moment. Going to make a new layer an I'm just going to start sketching in the shape of a waterfall. But my idea was you know with with these rocks, it could come from originally a little bit higher. Maybe a break off into some more places. So, in the in the reference we have the waterfall. Coming from this rock here. I think this might work may also work. There could be water coming all behind there. I don't know I don't know I think we have complicated it, too much. OK, I have an idea let's I'm going to save those layers 'cause we might return to them. But I'm going to try sketching it in just as it is in the reference and have that as a starting point, and then try to add on. Maybe that would be nice because we know this is working. We know this is working. So there's water bouncing down all these rocks. And one thing that I didn't. Quite get to show well enough is in the reference these rocks here are actually. Um. A little bit closer to us. And. There's the pool of water that the waterfall flows into is behind the rocks. So. So it's something like this. It's going down behind here. And we actually see where it's hitting the water. Hey Emily, I know yes, we're adding rocks there's already enough right. Hey Roman welcome. Thanks for coming. Thank you for the next comment. I'm yeah, we're I'm experimenting with maybe changing up this rock structure, a little bit. And I can't decide what I'm going to do let's try looking this up. And. Maybe. Bees. A little bit further back. If we do that. We have some more space. And then the waterfall comes down here. Bounces on another rock come down here. Pew Pew Pew. Pounces on this rock. And. Goes into the pond. And then we see a little bit of the. The flow. So now we have a little bit more depth, yeah, better OK. Alright will do this will do this, it's more a little bit more depth, I think. Like we can see layers in this pond a little bit more now. So. See you don't need to be scared of merging you can always. Make a selection copy things on to a new layer. It's no problem. Hello welcome welcome thanks for joining if you guys have any questions, you can let me know. Alright so that's my sketch of where the water is going to go. I'm just going to lower the opacity so I can see it as a guide. But I think I want to use a different brush for actually painting in the water or something a little bit looser an that might. Look splashy. Thanks, you guys. Thank you. I can give a tip on painting, waterfalls, I'm still learning. Still, trying to find some cool tricks with them. But one thing I notice with painting waterfalls is. And end with clouds also it's nice to not start with the latest white part. You kind of want to start with whatever you look at as a shadow when you're looking at the waterfall so there's like some. Gray blue darker Gray blue you kind of want to start with this color and then you can add like the bright white. Um. Sparkles or the lights hitting and it'll help make it look more alive, but if you go right into it. If you go right into it with pure white. It's it can look a little bit fake you know. It can be too bright for the whole area around it. The brush I'm using right now is called? Flat bristle. And it's a sort of painterly looking brush, it looks like. Um traditional type of. Oil painting brush stroke. And it's nice for doing the texture of the waterfall. I think is that it gives a little bit of splashy. Kind of feeling. But with stuff like this, it's almost always the case that you're going to paint in a race out. Go a little bit back and forth until you. Find what you like. So maybe choosing another brush that has a strong texture to it as a racer can be nice. That way when you're you can paint in an then go lightly over with the eraser. See how that looks sometimes you find like the perfect combination. OK, so. I will lower the opacity a little bit on that and. Bring back up the original sketch, OK so. I still want it to have the essence of the original sketch, So what I'm going to do is. Paint on Top of that. And use that to begin. The with the highlights. And maybe we can use the smudge brush or something like that. Waterfalls are so pretty. Need a little bit more blue in the shadows are here. Alright, thank you. OK, I think I'm going to merge these things. So. There's what the waterfall added. Maybe we can move that a little bit higher. Yeah, that's an improvement I think. I'll get rid of all these other layers of my tests. So here's a little review. This is kind of where it started. This was like the early stages of this painting. Where? Getting there. We have a rock that's sneaking out into the sun here. And over here, catching some light. You made a meme. Let's see. I think some of you might appreciate this. Merging layers. Having 63 layers or 163 layers or 563 layers. Oh thanks Mills. Um. I I feel like on Wednesdays when I do one stream where I work on a single composition, the whole time. Yeah, that really gives me a chance to focus on it in a different way. Like to spend. More time in the planning stage more time trying different things more time polishing. Yeah, it's really the amount of time that makes a big difference. And getting the kind of focus in and do more of like a tutorial on it is nice, too. Although. Yeah, I'm figuring a lot of this out as I go since this is a little bit of a new workflow for me. At the beginning, it was now I'm kind of a little bit in my normal groove, but That's you know, Jackson. Hey good stuff, thank you. Thank you. Alright I think it's time to do some. Some lighting things. So I'm going to make a new layer. Put it on. Multiply. And I'm going to take the Airbrush. Which is very different from the brushes we've been using so far? But I like these the airbrush with this kind of soft shading paper of thing I'm going to choose a purple. And. Just for certain areas that might choose different colors, but I'm going to come in with shadows where I think that they are needed. So under these rocks that can be a little bit darker. Be under the the log. Over here on the left just a little bit of soft. Shadows are going to do the same thing about opposite with light too. So if you think it's getting too dark don't worry. We're going to come back. With some light so I'm in the. What are we add some more green? Darker green. These rocks here, maybe little bit warmer color 'cause it's going to have a nice glow. OK. And I'm going to make a new layer. Going to put it on. Let's do linear Dodge. I will also choose linear Dodge on my. My brush. And. Going to choose a brush called soft shading and blending so it's like the airbrush, but it's a little bit has a little bit more of a hard edge to it. And. We'll see if this is the right brush for me, I might end up just going to Airbrush. But the idea is I want to come in and add some. Some more light on certain places on the rocks. And. Boost that up a bit. Currently looking at pictures of animals to draw and I have to tell you guys jellyfish are majestic jellyfish are so beautiful. They're really fun to paint. Draw. So I can put a little bit more highlights in the foliage. Yeah, I'm going to go to the Airbrush. I'm just overall give more of a glow. There. A new layer. I think I think I will just play a paint on normal mode right now. I want to make these highlights a little bit more intense. So. Just on normal mode. Oops it was still on linear Dodge. The normal mode going to paint in some highlights. Some dappled lighting some light shining through. The foliage. So we'll have some rounded shapes. In the Shadows and highlights. And those highlights are going to get really bright. Like I'm kind of building up to it, but I mean, the lighting is intense. In the reference an I think it's beautiful, and I think in our painting. We can make it at least as intense because why not I wouldn't even make it. More glow if we like. I want it to seem believable, but It is very bright. You can just put these little patches of light. Some can be softer than others. I really like that one rock on the left. So I'm I'm thinking, maybe light can be hitting the Top of the waterfall too. But I don't think it is in the reference exactly but. I think it would be really pretty. And why not even just reaffirmed as our focal point. PTM saying thank you. Uhm OK, so I'm going to flip. The. Campus and have a fresh look from over here. An add some more highlights into the water. Maybe even start giving some look like there's ripples here. There's going to be some green bounce light. On the rocks. There's just all these beautiful colors and hues, and this is where I think the colour the Hue dynamics. The brushes really. Is a string? Because as much as I am adding a lot of Hughes and selecting a lot of use. And different different colors, slightly different from each other that close. In color to give this a vibrant feeling. The brush itself is adding a lot because if I really wanted to select all those different colors myself. This would be uhm. More lengthy painting than it already is as far as like, we would take a long time. Yeah, that's right that's right, Emily My Internet yesterday was. It was the first time in over a year. I had that happen. My Internet randomly cut out, it was kind of spotty. For like 30 minutes. And. Yeah, I had to take like an hour break and then start streaming again because it was really bad. But everything seems to be back to normal now, so that's good. So I'm trying to figure out what to do here in the reference. I think there's another rock or something I'm going to zoom in. I try not to zoom in too much on my reference because I don't want to. Get sucked into too many details but at some point, you really are painting the details and you need to zoom in so. Here we go. Oh, that's funny, Emily like I should be in a different room or something. Different backdrop. OK, I'm going to make a selection of these. Of the area that I want to paint in and that way I can make my brush really large. Paint in that area. Without making tiny tiny little marks. Yeah, it's like a fancy headquarters. That'd be nice very cool. That's funny. I could totally see it, though. Again, I get your logic. Right so we need splashes down here. On the water. I think that's better. Help although I feel like it's not. Yeah, this is a little bit. Not horizontal. He the foam on the water and everything needs to be. It needs to be flat because you know gravity. We can go to window actually view rulers. I can grab a ruler and just take a look and see how flat this is 'cause I really want to flat. Line across the In the Top there. So for example. Sing. Get rid of the. The guide now. OK. Well. But things time to like zoom out and look at this and assess things and see what direction we want to go in. I can turn my painting to black and white. And check and see how the values are looking. I think there's some distracting stuff going on up here in the foreground so I'm just going to darken these. These rocks. It's interesting if you look in the at the water in the foreground. These rocks like completely disappear. When the paintings in black and white. In the reference there actually a bit later, you can see them even in the black and white version. So looking at my reference and looking at my painting my own painting in black and white it gives me some. Ideas like when it's when you're doing a photo study and you have a reference to compared to. You can get some ideas, where to go next so. That really helps. You know if you have. Someone you can ask and get a fresh look at it have a friend give you some feedback that's always nice too. But. There are little. Checks and tricks and things you can do to help see your own painting in a fresh way. and I kind of like to exhaust those things 1st. Try to figure it out myself and then and then at that point to ask for feedback as well. If I still can't figure it out or if I want if I try to adjust and then I want to. Find out if it was successful. Um Hey batter welcome thank you. I hope you're having a good day. For painting a Little waterfall. In the forest in the jungle. With lots of beautiful lighting and splashes of late coming down from 3 of the treaties. This is all one rock that kind of split into little pieces. Add some more. Yeah, as the brush as you make any brush with color dynamics, smaller and smaller it's going to make that effect. Of. The colors changing. Even more intense. Ha ha. Well, that's really cool Mills. Um. This painted the painting of the Rock family, having a blast at the waterfall nice place for vacation. I don't blame them. I like I like where your brains going that's very cute. It is a great. Great vacation spot for. For Happy Rock family. OK, I think we can add splash of light up here on Top of the. The falling tree as well. Mills as I started The Hobbit, an audio book this week and it feels like Bilbo is going to pop out near the waterfall. And that's very cool to hear good vibes. If anybody doesn't know I'm definitely a huge Lord of the Rings fan and I love the books and movies. Probably watch some way too many times. At least the original ones. I haven't seen The Hobbit as many times as I've seen the Lord of the rings. I prefer the original. Like. Or the rings, but But it's all good. All good vibes. Haven't watched the movies 'cause. They didn't get to reading the books really. I think there's so good. I mean? They are really good. It's kind of nice that you haven't seen them. Yet can you still have that to look forward to? Oh my God. Saying thank you. Thank you that just like made my day. Holy Moly that's it. It's a different comment. I've never heard something like that before thank you. Thanks very much I'm glad you like the progress. It makes me feel good to hear because you know when you're working on it, it doesn't. You don't see the transition as much as you know if you look away from it for awhile. Although I've been saving my layers. So it helps it helps to be able to look back and see. From there, but we're finally getting into the lighting now, so it's going to. Is going to? Be more. Pleasing. Let's Let's get some, like breaks in the Sky here where we see through to the brakes in the foliage where we see through to the Sky. That's what I'm looking for so. I'm kind of paint paint these little. There's like little zigzag pattern that kind of comes through also let me just give let me just taking it. Moment to explain like an idea here. This is something that I'm trying to work on myself, but I think I will share it with you guys, too. Is when even though we're working on? We're working from a reference and the reference already kind of does this for us, it has a pretty nice design to it already. You can keep in mind when you're painting that you know where is the focal point so it would be here right? Maybe even this is the first thing? Maybe this is the first thing or maybe this is the first thing you look at. But we can use these brakes in the. The clouds do point I keep saying clouds. I don't know why I'm saying that you can put this break in the foliage will seeing through to the Sky and the clouds. Like as a shape that is going to direct the viewer towards your focal point, so we can kind of. You know take what's in the reference but design it even more to our purposes. And make that. Make that help our composition. So. I'm going to try to. Make this feel a little bit natural but still. Uh make us look over towards the left that's my goal. I have a lend my Lord of the Rings books to someone I can't remember no it's always. No. Yeah, heroes welcome back enjoy your tea cheers myself, some tea as well. Oh, thank you. Igor wow that would be awesome. That would be awesome to do someday. I've never done. I have not done a live in person. Workshop before, but it's on my list of things I'd like to do. In my life. Yeah, thank you. So we can start to close this up a little bit. There's a more of an enclosed canopy you do have little cracks in it, but it's pretty. It's pretty dense and that's why we get that really cool effect of you know the dark shadows and the light. The really bright lights coming through. Oh. Add some shadow to the tree. Just kind of notice they hadn't worked on the trees for awhile they need some love too. I'm going to bring some light. Some patches of light hitting the trees and we can kind of do the same thing like the trees. Help. With directing RI back down towards the rocks. Now we can decide. You know how much late we want to add an. If we find anything really distracting from the reference. You don't have to include it if you think it makes the composition worse. Or, more busy, too busy can leave it out. But I think a couple little patches of light is gives a nice feeling gives a pretty cheerful feeling. Once I tried making a digital painting of course, but instead of making an elephant. That's funny. Sometimes we gotta go with the flow. In your world. You know horses can become elephants. I've started a lot of paintings with one idea in mind, and ended up doing something totally different. So I originally had planned that I was going to. Switch to a different type of 2 different brush. But I've just made this brush smaller and I'm using it to paint leaf shapes. An I think it's working OK like when you zoom in you can see that it's little squares and not. Like a round shapes or shapes of actual leaves, but I think it's working OK, so I will just. Try that out, and we'll see how it goes. I see Hey good to see you thank you. I hope you're having a good day. There are some bright green back here. One thing that I am trying to pay attention to with these studies and I think I'm. Slowly learning, but I still really need the reference is I'm trying to get a feel for the different colors of green that you get in different social situations. Select there's really different colors. Um. Of green when light is shining through belief versus when light shining on the leaf. When you're dealing with foliage and of course, the individual species of the plant can make a difference. 'cause of the actual color of the leaf could be different. Um. But yeah, there's all these little nuanced things. But it does help get the mood if you get the right color green. It does help explain what's going on and it's one of those things that. Your brain doesn't really you're not really thinking about it actively when you're looking at an image, but your brain is like subconsciously understanding it. When you look at something and it is a certain color. Green you're just used to seeing it in nature. So, your brain reads it as like. I know that light shining through the. The The leaves because that's what that looks like your brain just knows that's what that looks like. For some reason that doesn't mean that when you're trying to paint it, you can think of that color. But I'm trying to pay attention to the reference and notice. Those little differences in saturation and Hue like is it more yellow is it more. Braids. What is the right color to get that look? An it's hard because it's really, really vibrant green, but it's easy to make it too. Almost baked get too much. I notice that if you switch your greens a little bit more towards a yellow. Q it tends to make them feel more realistic. Just because it's a more natural feeling. Little bit more of a muddy color. Feels more feels more natural even though bright colors are very natural to you know. Jackson. You just got rid of your sketch. That's exciting. Thank you Joanna thank you very much. Jordan thank you welcome. Thanks for coming over. Thanks for watching stream. If anybody has any questions, you can let me know. I'm trying to explain my process as I go, but sometimes I get into painting zone and I might do some things. And if you're curious and you want me to explain anything you can just ask me. It's no problem. So there's going to be some more. Greens some more saturated greens as we're getting closer to. The focal points. And I want to try to organize a little bit of. What do we want these shapes look like here because? I like the feeling of the foliage kind of tumbling down that's what it feels like to me, it's like. There's a little bit of a gesture emotion to it as it's coming down here. Yeah, project. I got a little taste. I got a little taste of painting a waterfall yesterday and now here we are again I'm. Back at it. All I needed was 1 waterfall. Thank you. Thank you for the nice comments you guys. So I've been trying to every time that I do. A significant portion of painting I'm trying to create a new layer so we can look back at the progress. And soon I think I will switch to a brush that's more appropriate for painting foliage. So I'm trying to use this Phone as long as I can because I like a lot of that effects that it's creating. Let's work on the water and the rocks in the foreground a little bit. Hum. Maybe I should keep this rock pretty dark. I think it's distracting to have splash of light up there. I might Find a way to add some light to the foliage, though, so this. Tree here. Has? A bunch of little branches switch brushes. I have brushed that similar and has like a scribbly kind of texture. I just recently made this brush. And I didn't include it in the brush site yet. I don't know if it's actually good enough to. To share But I've been experimenting with it. Yeah, I don't think I will use it here. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Now I can totally see Bilbo on the rocks in the middle and Gollum in the Bush is Oh my gosh, like in the shadows. Sounds perfect. Yeah, so just basically painting in. A little bit of texture, so that I can continue painting. Would be? The tree here. But it's going to hopefully give a little bit of the look of. Branches and It's kind of like this scraggly tree it has all these. These are crazy angled branches and things. And maybe We should use a different yeah, so around it. I should use a different texture. 'cause we want that texture to be unique to the tree. Is this the same way to paint a human face you? Can you can you can use the same workflow if you want to? It depends for me, I like to paint faces. A little bit with a little bit softer brush is usually but. But that's just like depending on my mood. Sometimes I will use the harder brushes. You have a little bit of different style different effects, but maybe I will do a portrait sometime here. If you would like me, too. Thank you Brandon. Thank you. Hum. I like the I want the Shape of the tree trunk to stand out so the background needs to be lighter. That needs to remain. You always out back to what was there before. It's like it doesn't really make sense, but it's working. So. We will just leave it. And then this tree has a lot of little. Little these little branches, reaching out. He met a little bit so I want the tree to have a little bit more of a noisy texture to it. Like it can have more tiny sharp details. I've been avoiding that in the background because I don't want our eyes to get stuck back there when you have a lot of detail. That's going to draw the attention of the viewer and make you look at that area. The sharp contrast and detail. But I think this tree is one of the areas where we can have that kind of focus. And there's a couple branches that are just being hit like leap individual leaves being hit by light and there's almost like a glittery effect. And you guys know what time you guys know how it is. With the leaves they do kinda look like their glittering when light sitting them. Just at the Top center. Let me get that bit of noise. And this tree also has. Some. Individual little branches that are catching the light. And a little bit more of a warm color. Whoa saying thank you. Thank you that's very nice of you. Oh, I hope you enjoy watching the last episode. After this stream. I'm going to do my best to have an exciting finish to this painting. Thank you for thank you for the nice comments. Thanks everyone for hanging out here. Appreciate it. OK, I think that's a good start for that tree look. I'm going to leave it. And underneath of it, there's another Bush now the. The reference is kind of distorting things a little bit, for me. I think you Eduardo, thank you very much. Uhm yeah, I'm living in the Netherlands, but basically everything I do now is over the Internet through streaming. I'm originally from the US East Coast. Hi X Studio. How are you doing? So I'm not sure how to work on this area that I'm doing right now, I think. It might be a place where we actually start to get some individual leaf shapes that might be getting to that level of detail. What kind of work do you do studio? Is it OK for us to see the values? Yeah. I can turn it into black and white you can see what it looks like. So yeah, it's pretty dark. Watching you paint, though, is think that makes sense. I can do this, but then I see myself and I'm completely lost. You can do it. Brandon I understand the feeling, though I felt that way before. It's up to you. Like what you I can give like some general things that helped me I don't know if it's something that direction care to go. Go in or not, but. Uhm I used to have that feeling when I was especially when I was first getting into digital painting by still have it, sometimes especially when I'm seeing a new workflow or something. But. What I did was I would find a like a tutorial that I? Of this of a style that I liked or something that I was trying to do and I would try to paint. With the tutorial like at the same time, and then. Um. Yeah, so in the case of this stream. It's hard to do because it's live but maybe if you watched one of the past videos or? Find another artist who has this more step by step, tutorial that's easy to follow and like try to paint it. Try to paint it along with them and then you can pause it and rewatch areas, I did that with. The tutorials on one pixel brush com. The shadowy, Safari tutorials and I helped me out so much, but I had to like. Stop pause them and re watch parts and you know, I had to. Take my time because it was going so fast, but actually like going through the motions of doing the painting along with the tutorial even though I had to like do it much slower. That really made me like understand it in a different way than just watching it, and then trying to like. Everything later or you know. It's a good way to learn if you're looking to. If you want to learn a specific. If you want to learn a specific. Type of method. Type of method. OK, I think this is I think this is OK. OK, I think this is I think this is OK. I'm going to add a little bit more. I'm going to add a little bit more. Little bit more splashes of light here and there, warming up some color on the rocks. Little bit more splashes of light here and there, warming up some color on the rocks. And so we're going to get some more light in the foliage up here. And so we're going to get some more light in the foliage up here. Coming down around. Coming down around.

So I've definitely spent a lot of time looking at tutorials and. So I've definitely spent a lot of time looking at tutorials and. Alright just a little bit more. Some of these vines have light hitting them, too. Which is cool it's? Makes them look more. It sells them more I think. You can imagine a more in 3D space little splotches of light coming through hitting these. I like books because I feel like I can take my time. But some techniques. I can never figure out this, I watch someone do it. Yeah. Yeah, that's I understand. Like that by in a little bit shorter. OK, so. I've done a bit of painting. Maybe it's time to step back and assess how things are going. Emerged this down. Let me get us. Yeah, that's a lot OK. I'm gonna turn the painting in black-and-white could turn my reference into black and white. I'm going to look and see how much time left, I've been stream an let's judge what we can do to. Rap this up to make a nice strong painting, so I think we have a good amount of time left we have another. Like hour and a half or so. So. That's good, I might do a little bit of painting while it's actually in black-and-white here. I want there to be some darker shadows behind here. I think that might be nice for this could go a couple of ways, there might be, it might be nice. If there's some darker shadows behind there, so that the log kind of. Stands out more. May be back here. Over here this can be a little darker. And then we need to spend some time working on the. The rocks and The area in the foreground. Yeah. Hi David, Welcome. So I think in the reference. The water actually goes over here like this. The pool of water kind of opens up. And maybe it would be nice if we. We give a little bit more space to actually see that I want to try it out. I'm going to try it out. So making this rock a little bit smaller. An opening that up. I mean, we could even get rid of this rock altogether, but I think something would be missing without it. I think it's nice to have a little bit of something there. How do you decide when to create a new layer all let's look at question usually I'll work on something for just a little. Well, OK, So what I'll do is for example. Work on something for a while and. Then turn the layer on and off and see how it looks. I just like to. I like to have the. Look as if I'm painting on one layer like I want my painting to have a sort of traditional painting 5. So I create a new layer on Top of my painting, I always have a new layer going on Top of my painting. Um. High key thank you. I've been drinking coffee all stream or party all stream, but not. Now water so we need to hydrate don't forget to drink water. OK. Let's continue painting and thank you again, so the. The paintings that were just shown in the slide show. Those were some time. Studies kind of like the one I'm doing here only. Most of those were painted in a little bit more of A. Time constraint. Usually anywhere between 75 minutes. And a couple hours. So I really enjoy these streams on Behance, where I take a little bit more time we're still studying but taking our time and. Exploring styles a little bit more and. Um. Yeah, there's not quite so much of a rush, which is nice. Thank you. Eduardo thank you. Thanks for hanging out you guys if you have any questions or anything. Let me know. I appreciate you being here. If anybody is just joining in an you want to see the reference. I'm painting from you can look below the stream in the description for information. And all of the studies that I do on stream here, you're always welcome to join me there group studies. If you are interested you can. Take the reference and do a sketch or painting. And you're welcome to share with me what you do you can post in the chat your artwork when you? Are when you're done? The long format is nice love your live video. Thank you thanks Kay. I appreciate it. That's good to hear. I'm glad. Yeah, I think I think. Both are both are important. I think it benefits to do studies of different. Different amount of links I think it helps. Short studies kind of help. With. Just planning out the very basics of the image and working on. Composition and things and when we're getting into little bit longer. Studies like this. I feel like I can really play with texture and style an? Put a little bit more. Yeah, explore explore that a little bit more. Fascinated by the simple pure F program it does a lot. It does a lot actually like it's? It seems it seems simple it's a simple idea. But it has a lot of.' Options. Let's see we paint more water or we give you effective lighting to give the effect of water. I do think the lighting is going to help alot like have adding some reflection to the water will suddenly. Really make it read a lot more like water. But. We are going to paint what paint the water more before we're done with this definitely. As you probably I should probably get on that actually because I've been. Have a little bit too much fun with the foliage and. Before, you know it. Time will run out if I don't. Prioritize. But I think a lot well happen. With the Reflection I'm going to make a new layer put it on multiply mode. And. Um. Take a smooth brush. An add some. Shadows of Rocks below the water. That's my goal here will see what it if it actually ends up looking like that. But the idea is there's rocks right below the surface and we see like blurry shadows and forms and we can't quite. See them in as nice detail as the rocks that are above the water, but you can still tell. You know the rough shape and size of them. Yeah, exactly yeah, you Bros. We can, we can paint them in a little bit. But we're not going to get too detailed. Because. Well, we don't need to, like we can just hint at them and I think it will be enough. So for example, can use the smudge brush since this is under the water. It doesn't need to be crystal clear which is really good for us, so that means it's a little bit less work in the painting. So over here, there's a really dark. Shadow this is all underwater. And the real image looks like sandstone. I wonder if it is I don't really know what? Off the Top of my head I'm not sure. What that looks like? So I turn this layer on a Nov we can see the difference. It definitely cut into the glow, but I think it gave some more dimension. Hey shadow, crafts welcome. I hope you're having a good day. We're painting uh. Cozy waterfall in the forest. In the jungle. Thank you. Thank you, it was a little bit of a different workflow this time. I can take you back to the beginning, so we started with this there was a sketch so this was the early stages. And just kept blocking things in. Until they started making more sense. That's where we are now. Thanks, you guys. So there's some rocks under the water that have a little bit. Have a warm color. Just gonna share that in lately. Thanks. Yeah, the early stages of this workflow were very interesting. It looked like a completely abstract piece. Thank you. Thanks for the nice comments. If anybody came in after we already were you know. After everything was. Like you know already blocked in and you wanted to see those early stages. You can always watch the video later after the stream after it processes. It will be available and let me make sure my tool timeline is still running it is. OK so and it will also have captured with the tool timeline will have captured the tools that I was using and things like that so. It's cool feature. OK, so. There's a rock here. And I want. I want to work on these in the foreground so what's going to happen if I don't. It's suddenly it will be the end of the painting? And everything will look pretty nice except for these rocks, it'll be like No. The painting is ruined. So let's try to deal with them. Even though there's other areas that I'm more excited about working on. So there's some little cracks in the rocks and little. Details. But really it's just a grey rock. There's not that much, we can do one thing that's going to help is when I paint around the outside of the rock. Water is going to be coming right up on it, and they'll be like a little bit of A. Shine around the outside. That can really help make that make it look like you know water is touching. Touching the surface. I think overall, allowing the left side of the rock the side facing all the light to have a little bit of a glow to it. That can help. Emily. Thank you for being so sweet. I hope you're doing good are you going to be painting, a jellyfish by the way. Is that is that is going to be a thing? And then one more grey rock over here. With some darker shadows also. Let's get a? There's some some kind of Moss, or mold or I don't know what it's called. But there's these little discoloration. Of something that's growing on the rock. And I actually really like the look at school you see this also growing on trees and stuff. So there's a few rocks that have it. It's it's a very high contrast to the rock so I have to be careful. Because it really would draw our attention. Have to do some environments, I might try some under the sea one and add a jellyfish for sure. That's a good idea. He went in there. Alright I think it's working a little bit better. But not the center one that I erased that out. That was better before I. Break fix it. Ah thanks Hebrews. I'm going to do my best to make it an awesome result. I don't want to disappoint. Well, I think. I have a good feeling about this one. Algy Moss Lake in like such things interesting and infinitely variable that's right. I think that's the word I was looking for like in. Yeah. I agree. It's really, really pretty natural looking. Gives a nice mood and like you, said there's so many different variations of it. You can kind of like do whatever you want and it's a. Possible. To exist it seems. One thing that's great about painting and natural scenes and landscapes. Is that nature and allows you so much freedom? Can you make people in the next video? Um. I don't I don't know I will consider it. I will consider it. I appreciate the suggestion. Uhm I would consider it. I my original plan was to stick with virtual Plein air painting for awhile. Just to get some good practice in this and teach my method of doing it. But I've had a couple of. I had a couple of requests to do profile portraits. So I will consider that I'm actually going to be doing. Portrait studies starting next week in my discord server, so it would kind of go along with it if I were to do. One on stream. Hi David I'm for this one, I'm going to be working on it for about 4 hours altogether probably. And. I think that's a good amount as an average for me, sometimes my. My studies will be shorter than that. But if I'm working on something that I want to have a nice result for hours is usually going to be the minimum for me. To get a nice painting, I need usually around that amount of time. Thank you. Thank you very much album and everyone for being here. Leigh Leigh Ash LMAO. I hope I'm saying your name OK. Thank you for. Thank you for being here. At this stage, I'm I'm trying to allow myself to stay stay a little bit loose, because I want to finish the painting in a polished way. But I also want to keep the painterly feel that I've been working on. So it's a difficult balance and there's some areas that I'm not 100% happy with like over here. Maybe. Bierocks they need some. Some work I'm going to add some foliage on Top as well. But I'm going to allow myself to take a larger brush. What I was using earlier in the painting and just kind of come along here and paint more loosely? See what happens. Um. Um. That's hard to that's a hard comment to respond to. Um. Victor I'm sorry, but I think you have. Friendly nice intentions, so thank you for the compliment, but I don't really want to get those type of comments here. I hope to teach about art and share my art and, yeah, I'm not here looking for dating or anything. Um. Conrad thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, I mean, I'm in a happy relationship. I just want to put that out, there, OK, let's. Let's continue. With the painting I'm going to add some more greens. Thank you very much Clifford. Alright so I want to add a little bit more leaf shapes. Up in here. We can actually get to the point of showing some more individual smaller shapes and textures. Now I think. Because we're getting into that phase of detail where I think it's. Yeah, it's time it's time, we're in the detailing phase. We made it we made it here. So we can do things like. There will be some vines coming across. Uh phase are welcome welcome welcome. We are working on a painting a? Virtual Plein Air painting, which means we found this reference image through map crunch com which is a way of. Searching through Google Street View images you can check out the link below the stream. And I can give you a little preview of what we've done so when we started the stream. I had a sketch. And blocked in the very basic colours. And. Then. Yeah, I went from basic shapes and slowly work their way towards. Towards this image and you can always re watch the video later if you like. Thank you thanks everybody. I really appreciate the I really appreciate the nice comments and support on my art. Thank you. If I do anything and you're curious what my processes if you want me to explain any of the tools. I'm using? You can definitely ask. Their caged, hi thank you. Thank you very much. I'm trying to decide where there's a good place to add. Great. Leaves. We want the feeling of light shining through the leaves and kind of pointing towards. The focal point here. We've got. A lot of fines and. Some really cool effects with those types of things. Welcome back saying. You're creating such a nice mood with this reference. Thank you Jackson, Oh, I'm glad you think so. I hope I hope yours is going well, I hope you're having a good time. If you're painting, though. Going to add some more Blues into the Sky here and maybe over here, too. Maybe I'm being a little too shy with. Play coming through the trees. Maybe there would be a lot more places where we'd see little spots of light coming through. Oh, you're welcome enjoy the brushes. Thanks for hanging out. So appear. I want to put some shines on the leaves and I'm curious how to handle this. I think maybe something like this can work so when we're looking at. Be these areas over here, a lot of the leaves are mostly dark there, mostly in Shadow and then there's just a couple areas. Shining through where it gets really bright there's like a tiny bit of light hitting strongly on some of the leaves. So I'm I'm like a little scared. I'm a little timid to make them so. Bright but Maybe it's cool to do. A Royal Bengal Tiger. I could see a Tiger in the scene. I could see a Tiger getting here. I am using a pen, so I'm using I'm painting on a welcome centriq 22 that's my tablet. Is a screen tablet and? And I'm using a stylus to paint on it. A lot of the brushes I'm using our pressure sensitive. So you would really need to have some kind of tablet doesn't need to be a screen tablet doesn't need to be anything Super Fancy. But it would be really a big help to have a tablet. Yeah, no worries. You can't really see it when I'm working I'm sorry about that. You got this, Jackson you've got this. There's a huge rock behind the log supported by standing rock in the shadows. Yeah, I saw that you Bros I couldn't decide what to do with it at first I don't know if it's the right choice. But I decided to leave it out of my painting because I felt like. It was hard to tell what was going on. And it looks like the rock is floating an I don't know it just felt kinda weird so I left it out. I don't know if that's the right idea. I guess it can go anyway. Right we conclude it or not include it. I decided not to. And just make the log like the central focus. Um. Having some issues with my tablet Oh. Well, that's not good. Having issues with your tablet is always like just a frustrating situation. Hi sling more happy Wednesday, thank you. Thanks for coming over glad you like the painting. With Stylus pen help for this type of painting about a stylus pen, which has a rubber kind of tip. What are you painting on E Bros are using uhm like an iPad or something? I don't remember what you said before. Was this the awesome. Starbucks Florida mug it? Is is the Starbucks Florida mug? Is a good mug is very big? That's my favorite well, one of my favourites, I have get attached to coffee mugs. I have way too many. Alright so I'm adding some little Datsun noisy texture. Because in the foliage when it gets far enough away that's really all we see anyways just a bunch of dots different colors. I ended up kind of turning this painting into like a one brush challenge not 100%, I can totally say it was 1 brush but. Significant portion of the painting was done with just the one brush. Anne I liked the consistency of that. So I'm going to stick with it. A little bit more. Right so green and Blues. Over here. Bright greens here, the brightest greens are always going to be. Generally, near the Top or where you know where you see through to the Sky right around those areas. Where the leaves might be a little bit thinner than in groups? No. Mills. Um is he says, I'm pretty confused. I thought I saw a YouTube video of a guy, saying that design is that art. I'm getting crazy well, everyone is allowed to make YouTube videos. I feel like you're going to get you can get opinions on everything that doesn't mean we need to. Take them seriously. How can someone even say something like that? Maybe it's just clickbait. Wonder if you can add some light Rays coming through the trees, yeah, maybe maybe so, so The thing is. I don't really have a lot of effects in this uhm. In this painting that are. You know sort of photo shop affects it's I'm using photo shop, but I'm not applying like lens flares and. I mean that's just a dramatic example. But sometimes when I add light Rays and stuff like that, it gives it a very like. Digital kind of graphic look where I'm kind of going for a more traditional vibe. So maybe I can add them, but I'm just a little worried that it'll come across to digital or something. That makes sense. But one thing that we can do to get kind of the look of that is to just lighten things in the right areas. You know if we if I add enough light coming through here. If I brighten all this up then it'll make us feel like lights coming through. Even without actual raise or anything like that. Yeah. So from this layer to this layer, it's getting a lot more messy. It is getting more detailed. But. I'm going to erase out a little bit of what I did in the water. That's one of the reasons that I do like to keep separate layers like that. And maybe we can do some adjustment layers. How to reply to specific comments I think you can put AT and the person's name I'm not sure if it might be. Be. Maybe it's not working but I have been able to do that before. Um so. You can try that Roman. And then they will get A tag. OK, so I'm going to make a new layer and make an adjustment layer so on my layers palette. Uh my layers pool is covered right now, but let me move it over here, so you can see what I'm doing. So. You go to the. Like half circle divided icon here and then you can press. Press that down and then go to whatever type of adjustment layer you want to use. And I think. I will go with something like levels. And we can play with the levels. The darks and lights in the image and see. If we want to make things a little bit more dramatic. We can go we can mess with the mid tones. Arrange the highlights. Um. So I'm going to undo that. And then try again fresh. I kind of want to darken things a little bit. I don't know if I don't know if that's the right direction to go in. But I'm imagining maybe if I darken things I can make that center area stand out a little bit more. As being really bright so for example, everything starker. An I can go to this layer and use my airbrush. And mask away. The area that I want to be later, so for example, back here this distant foliage. We don't want that to get darker. We want it to look like there's more atmosphere. Between send those trees, so they can still be later. But. And there's a little bit of a glow of light around the focal point, so that can also be later. But basically this just creates a little bit of A. Like a big net around everything else. Which I think is OK? Sometimes I will play with things like adjustment layers for. Color balance. You can go through The Shadows Midtones and highlights these sliders. And decide if you want to add more blue more yellow, I mean. Look how different that mood is. I tend to really like, adding blue and magenta into the shadows. But it can go pretty much. Yeah, you just have to see how things feel, but I like to use the sliders just. Just looking at them just kind of seeing what looks good. Midtones. Think Midtones being a little bit more warm makes sense in this situation. And then highlights. And sometimes I do a bunch of changes and then I look later turn. The layer on and off and I don't like it so let's see. Before. After before after. It got a lot more green. I think I lost some of those nuances. Of the Yeah, I don't really like it, but what I do like is the water. I do like that warm glow in the water so I can basically like mask everything out except that area. And leave that. Good stuff to explore adjustments, yeah, it is fun to use. Is there a time during your painting that you just want to erase everything and start over not on every painting Luckily, but every once in awhile? Yes. Like I don't know I can't give you a percentage. It's generally pretty rare. But every once in awhile. I start a painting and I go about it for awhile and then I realize. It would have maybe been better if I. Had started this in a different way this workflow they don't work, and then at that point I'm like. It would make so much more sense to just start over you know. So, sometimes in those situations. Yeah, I want to just start over. Or if I just really hate how painting is going. We usually not usually not locally. Another adjustment layer I like is selective color. So, in this one, you can choose a specific color range like. Let's try greens 'cause there's a lot of green in this and then you can move the sliders through. Each of these so for example. For everything in the image that has that is green you can adjust do you want to have more or less cyan? Like do we want it to be more natural yellow green kind of earthy feeling or do we want more. Like almost tropical jungle blue green you know you can take things into different directions. What about magenta? How much magenta do we want? Look at the difference. Sometimes it doesn't even. You wouldn't even think like I don't even think of a lot of these things when I'm painting. You know, I'm just doing what I think looks right and then when you go. To this step, you really like whoa look makes you notice things in a different way I think. Uhm and then you can adjust the values. So yeah, the yellows so that's kind of cool if we take away cyan from the yellows. Look how much more like. Glowy they get. So a sort of dangerous thing in this. Area of the painting is that you can really change things a lot. You can really change things a lot, so. You have to be careful, sometimes after I do changes. I look at the painting in black-and-white an icy. I tried to say, Um I try to figure out if I'm making a change. That's really changing the. Value structure in a good or bad way. Or maybe it doesn't change it at all, and that's OK. The last thing I want to look at is magentas I know there's a lot of. Magenta in this or Purples. Yeah, so we can either. I know it's subtle. But if you look at the rocks. We can either take away the magenta purple color. Or we can add it and I like. I like the magenta effect, so I'm OK with it. Being pretty intense. Then we can make the rocks darker later. So if I were to group all these or just merge it down. So that they are all combined here's the before and after, so before. After. Before. After. Before. After so I think it really does bring your I'm or to the center. And a little bit more saturated overall. I like it so we'll keep going. So let me see what time it is. Alright we're doing good, I think we have about. About 3045 minutes of streams ago, so I'm going to do my best to make this nice and polished and. Looking good at it by the end of that time and we'll see how it goes if we need to take a little bit more extra time I can. But I think that should do it. Do you selective color layer when everything else is merged yes usually usually? Because um? Yeah, I find it a little annoying because if you don't then. You have to maybe apply it to different layers that are separate from each other and then if your color picking an painting below the adjustment layer it gets a little confusing sometimes. So I prefer to do it for me when it's merged but. You know, everyone has different preferences. Alright so I'm going to paint some of the water highlights here and I don't know if this brush is going to be the way to go, but I'm just going to try it. So I'm just sketching in um. Some water reflections. There's a couple. Basically, the water reflections are mirroring the. The Sky if you look up wherever there's a breaks in the. The foliage and you're seeing the blue Sky. That's also reflecting on the water here. Really, like the highlights on the Lone Tree on the right very nice thank you. Thank you project. That tree was fun to pain. We got some really bright. Areas on the water over here, but with a lot more yellow. A lot brighter. More saturated. And then there's also there's a lot of stuff going on the water has a lot of colors, reflecting in it, there's also. Some yellows and greens reflecting. And there's also the blue Sky, reflecting it's it has a little bit more of a blue purple Hue than when I. And what I did let me try to. Get that color a little bit. Working a little bit better. OK. So. That's a start up let's take the smudge brush. And smudge some of these. Lines so I hope that's going to give it a little bit more of A. Of a water you liquidy look. Little bit of a soft edge is there. This is going to be multi layer process, I think. Around the rocks there's a little bit of a shadow. So basically if they're curved under and meeting the water like this. There's going to be a little shadow. Would creating a new layer just for the water on the rocks help. It make it more realistic. Not the waterfall talk about the city com water. Creating new layer for just the water on the rocks help. I'm trying to understand what you're talking about. I think I think what you're saying is you want to see more of the rock under the water. I think. So I can paint that I can paint that in. Like just a little bit more of. What's going on underneath? I think. I can get away with. Just putting a little bit of that on this one rock here. I'm not going to get super detailed with the water and the stuff going on underneath of it 'cause I think. I don't think it's really needed. I think if we get sucked into going into that detail we might. Half the painted everywhere. You know, so I was like. When you're simplifying things. And it's working and then you add a detail somewhere, then you kind of your brain wants to see that figured out everywhere. And I think that's going to be a little too much for for this painting. So basically for me, I just have these like shadow shapes here. And that's supposed to be hinting at rocks and the water. Maybe it's not pulling it of- under percent. But. I think it's I think it's OK. For the amount of time, we have. I like a little bit of blue in the water. I'm just noticing it. There's a little bit of gradients. Blue green gradients going on over here. Under the water. Going to make a new layer put it on screen mode. Don't really know if that's the right layer mode for what I want but I'm going to experiment a little bit. I want to add some lighting effects that are just. Giving the idea of light bouncing off the water. And creating a soft glow. You might not be. Yeah, I will lower the opacity a little bit 'cause That's a bit strong, but that is kind of what I want. Just a little bit of A. But glow. Going to be brave. If we want cool moods in the painting sometimes you gotta be brave. A little bit of light on these rocks here. Hopefully, that will help give them some kind of 3D feeling and dimension. Going to flip this. So we're going to breed outside. It's too quiet is really quiet here right now, which is actually refreshing. Um. It doesn't happen too often. I'm exaggerating a bit, but my neighbor, sometimes will likes to play basketball or do some other noisy things. Well, I'm streaming. So. The choir is just fine. But yeah, it's nice if we get some little bird sounds or something like that, sometimes we get rain. Rain ASMR. Specially, I'm living here in the Netherlands and we have had a lot of rain this autumn. Quite a lot. No screaming children, Yes, that is well, I also live near an elementary school and. Usually around certain times of day, you'll hear them like. Getting. Out of school. Screening. Happy screams, but still like no not now. All right. Let's try a layer on color Dodge because we all love a good color, Dodge later. I want to play with the idea of. The shape of this light area. Who another not the color want? Yeah, maybe that. But having this area be a little bit more defined as like a specific shape. Sometimes you have to go through the. The options of colored when you're using color Dodge or some of these things. That's way too strong. It's like really intense. I'm just going to get rid of it. All right, let's put the layer on fillet layer with black baton color, Dodge mode, sometimes we get better results with this. Yeah. Little bit better. It preserves the values a little bit more. Hey Christina welcome. So I kind of like the? Strong shape of the edge of the highlight on that rock. Oh, OK Mills, let me scroll up. Mill says I forgot did you get to take any winter photos yet or is it too early to early here. We're still in fall even though it feels very cold it still looks like autumn and. Could be a mermaid in the scene? Play little. Who watery highlights? Around these rocks, too. Lock the layer. I think that works. Hey Erin get to see you. Hope you're having a great day. Thanks for coming. Ryan says if you keep knocking these landscapes out of the park. Eventually, you'll run out of Super Cool Pictures and places to paint. Who knew earth had so much to offer right? It's It's beautiful. It's such a beautiful place is seen doing these doing these virtual plane airplane things really. Has me appreciating different typesof? Um geography and different places that I've never been and didn't know about before at all. I suddenly have like a bunch of new places on my I want to travel here list. It's amazing. Oh my gosh, yes. Ah. Excellent. Alright I'm going to get some more. Little fines and things here. Over here as well. Move that down 'cause I think I like it so far. I'm going to add some more vines from this little tree here just because just because why not? Signs are really fun to paint and they have a cool effect. Beautiful thank you. Thank you very much for the comments. Uh things rain. That's very nice of you, I am. I have to say, I get a lot of inspiration from. From you guys my community here and then the. Discord and through through Twitch basically everyone you guys are always making suggestions of things and requesting try this and try this and. Usually I'm like Oh maybe. And then the next thing you know, we're like doing whatever that thing is. You guys have definitely given me a lot of good. Ideas and suggestions and. Having votes sometimes on what we will we will paint and everything. That also helps me not allow myself to get stuck in any kind of. Only doing one thing. I appreciate that. Um Abdul had I am doing good. Thank you how are you? I'm enjoying enjoying the stream during the painting. Oops I accidentally chose the history brush that's not what I want. We're kind of in the. The end stages of the painting we still have a little bit more to go. Um were polishing things up probably for the next 30 minutes, so for anybody who's painting along and wants to. Have an idea of how much longer. It's going to be before we end it will be probably about 30 minutes more painting. Polishing this one and so, if you want to share your art. With us before the end, that's That's a good amount of time, but I'll also say so. When we get closer. I don't think I like that branch that I added will try something else. There's also some little breaks in the. We see through to the. Sky back here, but I don't know if I should do that. I don't know if it's going to be too too, attracting of our attention. Maybe if I lower the Opacity. That's a tough one. That's true project well that's a whole different thing. Um. That's a whole different thing. At the moment I'm pretty. Pretty much sticking towards realistic. Bike. Things that at this time I can paint in that exists so sci-fi is a really tough one 'cause you end up having to construct a lot of. Of yourself so maybe in the future. I will be more prepared for that at the moment I feel like I still. I still would have a challenge with it. Ha ha ha. I play 3D my English is not good. That's OK, you're doing good, I can understand you. But if you want. Let me know what I can call you because I don't. I can't read your name. I'm sorry just let me know in English, but I can call you so I can. I can do that, but thank you for hanging out. I flip this, I want to add an extra bright highlight here. Good luck Jackson you got this. I hope you guys are having a good day. Thanks for hanging out with me. It was nice to get the paint, something really relaxing. The last few streams here, I've been picking really challenging references for myself. And I like to challenge myself, but in between there. You gotta like have some comfort zone stuff to enjoy. Even though we did try something new with the workflow here. I love this type of setting and I feel comfortable painting. Waterfalls and natural scenes. So it was nice to do something like that. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll pull ahead. Thank you for the next comment. I'm very tempted to use a? A leaf brush or something like that just because there's a lot of I'd like to have a like. Quite a bit more. Detail. They want to hire detail level. And we're trying to figure out how to do that in the short time. But I'm going to try to stick with just sketching sketching them in loosely with the brush. 'Cause I like the look right now that it's been all really hand painted. There's one thing that I really like in the reference that I haven't gotten yet and that is the feeling of these different like vines and things up here so I'm just going to. Paint in some hanging up. Fines and try to get. The look up some of these individual little plants. Just at the end I think it's possible for us to look at these kind of details. Make some leaves reaching out to the middle. I'm going to turn on color dynamics. And turn of.- Apply per tip, so that means with each of paint stroke. It should give a slightly different. Q It's not going to be a very big change because my? Settings aren't set up for that. Thank you very much for the nice comments you guys. I really appreciate you being here and being so encouraging. You I will be doing this every every Wednesday. And I start around around like 4 hours ago. From what time it is right now is when I start? Around that time, so and if you follow me here and if you want if you are if anybody's. Wants to join my discord. I'll post the link in the chat, but also the. In my on my profile you can find the link there, too, in case anybody is watching this video. At a later time you can find it there. So I'm going to add some. Brighter leaves the background here and maybe I'll try putting the brush spacing. Up and putting on scattering and I don't know maybe I can. More quickly paint some textures if I do this. Hum. Trying to decide where I can have like, some little branches coming out from the shadows. I think it will help this still look a little bit more lush. If I have some individual. Branches and leaves that can be really identified as plans. Right now, it's a catch is a mass of green and I would like there to be a little bit more logic to it. Let me think we happening with the rocks in the foreground or as they find, as they are. There are bits uhm. Basic compared to the rest of the painting as far as detailed level, but They are something that I kind of want to be ignored so. I don't really want to draw a drawer, I to them. So I think I'd like to get away with leaving them close to the way that they are now. But I might it might be wise for me to work on them a little bit more just because sometimes. Yeah, if they look really bad that's going to attract our attention to. But. No thank you Erin glad you think so. Is this for a portfolio? I might put it in My Portfolio here on be hands, but it's not for a specific um. It's not for portfolio to get a specific job or anything like that, it's more for practice. I'm doing a lot of virtual Plein Air paintings just through experiment with my style an. Improve my landscape painting and values an understanding of. Um. Yeah, I'm just everything colors and mood lighting and stuff like that. It's mostly for practice. But if it comes out really good. I will put it in. When stepping away my eyes went there, 1st and then to the go to the middle really. That's surprising to me. OK. It might be partially because of the. The amount of. Contrast here that could be drawing I a little bit. Another thing we can do to try to hide it hide them a little bit is add some foliage. I can go to a bigger brush. You know, and add some greens on Top of this rock and. Maybe this one. They don't have to be extremely well sorted out. Thank you Marcus. So what I mean, is we don't have to get very, very polished with the foliage I think. But we do have to. Pick the right colors and. And values so that it reads as. It reads in the correct lighting and things like that. Like a cinematic thing cheating where the eye goes, yeah, I hope so. That's what I'm that's what I'm going for is like we don't want you to look there. But you guys can let me know like everyone has a different. Vision or perception or or Whatnot Ann. So you guys can other people can chime into an let me know like where your where do you think you're the focal point is here? What's attracting your attention? Is there anything attracting your attention? You don't like. That kind of thing. Um. I can add some. Silhouettes here be cause the? The foliage is going to be darker than the background. We can add some grasses and things and that might be nice. Interior design CG artist ice. It's very cool. Maybe there's some plants that are more like A. Make a poem sort of thing like that. Does it change? Have your landscape studies change how you look at nature Oh yes. And Yeah, but yes to both of those doing a lot of landscape studies has changed how I see nature absolutely. And it's changed how I take photos it changed everything like I just I notice different things like I notice. Things with the lighting and different opportunities like. Little things that he didn't care about before that, they are things that I find attractive in painting. Now I notice them in real life more. So it's hard to think of an example. But just different lighting scenarios bounce light or mostly just things to do with colors and lighting. Also texture. But very much so with taking photos. Luckily, I've improved the taking photo is not in the sense that I like I'm really good photographer anything. But I'm making better compositions in my photos, so I didn't realize that I was. Making bad compositions before until I started getting into doing these paintings and then I noticed looking back at my photos that like a lot of them. We just completely no thought into the composition you know just looking at something and taking a picture of it. Like even things that I would take a picture of for my own reference. There was no thought of composition. It was just take a picture of the thing I might use it later. Whereas now regardless of what I need a photo for I'm still going to try to make a good composition of it. You know like it's just have more practice with that and it's become more. It's become more easy for me to see. An opportunity for a good composition. If it feels good to be able to notice that like that, it's helping that studies are helping. Do you think it's weird to look at the photo in grayscale before taking pictures in nature? No, I don't think that anything is weird if there's some kind of thing that helps you visualize what you. Are doing whether it's in photography or art or anything? I think it's totally fine to do you know? Fresh Tina Penguin mug from this amazing artist. They know come back to crazy progress also worked thank you. Thank you very much shadow craft. I really appreciate that it's nice to hear if you. Take a break and come back that you see progress. Appreciate that how do you do you guys like the foliage in the bottom or do you think? It's too like stylized for this. Let me know your thoughts. Book idea and title around the world in 80 mad days. Just 80 of the amazing play near paints. That's cool. Thank you. You like the naked rocks. Not bad as long as it's not too bright. I want to attract. Maybe I'm going to duplicate the layer and play with it a little bit. Maybe I can just move it over into the corner. I kind of like the silhouette of the foliage. Against the grass I think it's kind of cool. But maybe it can go into the corner. Not that it's like in time out or anything. But I just think that. I do kind of like that Flat Rock. Looks better OK. I opened in the corner. OK, there, we compromised compromised. Yeah, 'cause I liked it a little spots that were on those rocks, too. It's not covered up. A little bit. OK Jackson says I'm going to call this one done can't keep track of my layers anymore. Alright let's see. By Christina. Uhm let me open this link. Woo that came out really nicely. This is artwork from Jackson Joker in the. In the chat who joined in with this painting. Oh man the waterfall looks so cool. I love how you split up like that texture. It looks very clean. It gives the Shape of the water, splitting on the rocks and the log. The broken tree. The textures are it's interesting because it's textured and kind of stylized but it looks super realistic like specially the Top. Really really cool. Thank you so much for painting with me, it's awesome to see. An I like that, you're zoning in on you know the reference. Changing the reference like this one user kind of zoomed in on an area a little bit more than I did I think. Came out great. Came out awesome. OK so let's keep going. I'm going to. I want to merge this down but I'm like. I'm not sure about it yet. Thank you. Thank you Devan Union I'm using Windows. And yeah, I'm using Windows 10 and I'm using my left hand for the keyboard shortcuts. I reprogrammed a lot of them so that. I could reach everything with my left hand. Um. Because well, yeah, you know a lot of the default shortcuts. You need both hands, but I'm drawing with my right hand so. It's it is very nice, though I that's one of the reasons that I. I love to use the keyboard is that I know that I can always rely on it. I have a welcome centriq 22 and I know a lot of people like to use the well actually the. Isn't that I have doesn't have the buttons around it? Some of the some of the. Some of them do have their own buttons, but I prefer to just use the keyboard. 'cause I know it's always going to be. I was going to be the same. Ebro says if you ever get a chance. Please make a step by step video of your paintings like step. One making the line step to adding the base colors to 3 highlights. I do think it's a good idea your Bros I would like to do that sometime. It's been a long time since I've done something like that. Card the reason I didn't for a long time was because I was so much was changing with my art. I was. And even now, I'm always like trying new workflows. But That being said, I do have some methods that I paint in that I think I'm. That I used enough that I think I would be happy to make a tutorial it just takes time. It takes time to do it. But I would like to do that at some point. Like I try to explain what I'm doing as I stream, but I understand that it's not so easy to follow along in this kind of setting and I mean, I hope that I can make it. Is easy as possible but I understand it's not quite as easy as following along with a tutorial that goes really step by step. Especially because there's a random. There's random. Questions and things that can. Take us into different conversations, so I might talk about something different than what I'm doing. Um heiser heat, I will try to speak more slowly when I get going, sometimes you know you go into. You just go into autopilot and start speaking fast. I think maybe I do speak a little fast, but I'll try. Great picture right there, thank you. Thank you. So I'm going to lock. The layer and add a little bit of highlights on too. This little Bush here. Bill use an airbrush. Hum. I feel like that Bush could have a little bit more effort. I'm like trying to quickly do it at the end, but I don't think that's the way to do that. Let's let's try to get the little better shading there. D prefer painting water rocks or plants. Implants. That'll be plants, Aaron, but I really enjoyed everything in this scene. I do like also painting water I find it difficult. And rocks, I don't really like painting, but I like looking at them. I like looking at paintings where they're painted well. I just want to get better at painting rocks. 'Cause it sunset time it is can you tell it's getting darker? Yeah, the sun, it said so. Early now. Um. Oh Jackson, the brush that I'm using that I used to paint most of this painting is the. Rectangle texture brush if anybody wants my brushes, you can type actually you can look below look above the. You can look above the chat and click the info panel and download my brushes from there. And this is called rectangle texture and I added color dynamics. I just added color dynamics, so that it had. This kind of effect going on with it for most of the painting. And. That's a different thing than what it has a default so other than that it's. Yeah, that's the first time using? Thank you for you, thank you. So we're almost done here, I can maybe look at one more time at the waterfall and see about. Maybe adding some little splashes here and there, some little individual. Details. Got it looks cool nice. I like it, I like it, it's been fun to use. I know you have a favorite parts of portrait painting, so I was curious if you have favorite parts of landscape too. Yeah, I do, I do? I definitely do I love painting foliage the most. And. There's certain effects that I really like to paint alike. Like where things kind of fade into the distance and get a little bit lighter and less detailed that's an effect. Feels very satisfying to paint like back here how this green is a little bit lighter and. Um less. Yeah, it was. Less saturated. That kind of stuff. I'm going to. Space there. The brush a little bit. Maybe I can turn up scattering and an angle jitter. Yeah, the extra painterly parts by project have to head out in the great stream them using painting thank you. Thank you so much. You guys I'm going to. Post this one, I will. Um definitely post it on my Instagram and I might also post it here on be Hans. I try to choose. What I find are my favorite or my better paintings supposed here so we'll see if this one makes the cut. But at the very least if you want to catch up with you if you want to see the finished one. I will post it on my Instagram. Thank you. Samuel that's awesome to hear I'm really glad you like it that much. Thank you. Um Yo Quinn Hello, Hi, everybody, thanks for hanging out, we're reaching the end of the stream here. I will give a couple minutes, though in case anybody painted along that wants to share their work, Jackson, It was awesome to see yours. Thank you for thank you for joining I know some of you might be like working on other things or at work or? Wherever you are, and I know it's not always easy to participate. But I just want to let you guys know I do this every Wednesday. An I love it. When people paint with me and it doesn't matter what skill level. You are or anything like that, you're welcome to join in. You can. Just post your artwork when you are finished in the chat an I would love to look at it. This is just because it's more fun to study together. I think than apart so if you want to. Join me in some landscape studies that's mostly what I'm going to be doing. Although I've had a couple of requests to do portraits that we might do portraits too. We'll see we'll see but certainly will be doing more landscapes and it will be every. Every Wednesday and about 4 hours earlier from now is when I began. The stream and yeah. I try to do about the same time. Every week. Thank you Tom you use? Thank you. Ryan thank you. K. Thank you. That's very nice of you, I'm happy to hear that. Thank you for hanging out and keeping me company you guys. Yeah, I guess this is it I will zoom in 200% real quick so you can see. It's still it's still a bit messy and crazy when you zoom in this is what the painting looks like.", "duration": 7292.470000000021, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url":

We do get a rock formation on the left and some trees on the right which is better than nothing but I really do like the combination of having things closer to the Camera as well as farther away because it helps it makes it easier to show depth in your painting things get really flat if everything is like in the distance. So we'll see if we can maybe exaggerate some of the foreground stuff and make it more interesting. But yeah, I'm going to be doing a painting of this reference. This is from mapcrunch.com. It's a website that takes a Google Street View images. I'm sure you guys that are here all know about this already 'cause. I'm always talking about it, but in case anybody's knew that's what I'm doing and the reference image should be available below the stream so if you want to paint along you can. Um. The setup looks different I can't find the reference Oh no really. Well, I can just paste it in the chat as well. But I wonder why? So here's the link to the reference image. And it's also in the discord also is in my discord. Yeah, but welcome everybody. So if you want to paint along if you like the scene and you want to paint along that would be awesome. You're welcome to take the link and do a little sketch or painting with me. You're welcome to. Kind of take the reference and do your own thing with it if you have some sort of a particular inspiration. I'm going to try to do a study based on the reference. But maybe just change the foreground things a little bit so. That's my plan. Good grinding some ink tober stuff, Oh my gosh. It's just about time right are you doing, you're doing all your like plans of exciting. A summer Nina welcome welcome everybody. I hope you'll be able to find a reference image if not. Let me know when I'll just paste the link in the chat. But I'm going to be painting. This image, I'm going to place it on the Top here using pure ref so that. We can just always be on Top of everything well. We're working you can see a little thumbnail view. Yeah, I'm going to do about a 3 hour painting on this so I hope we can get something really nice. By the end, often times when I do virtual Plein Air Studies. There just a little bit longer than an hour so having a 2 or 3 hour. One is really nice. And we can hopefully get a good finish result with it. Terra says it done all my plans, mostly getting a head. Start working on the first two prompts awesome. I can't wait to see it. A cow the stream so high quality on full screen. Enjoy thanks for being here, guys, I hope you enjoy this more high quality stream and. Yeah, there, you go Robert thank you. Yeah, exactly that's what I'm using for the reference image. Although I might have to set up some I might have to do some settings in here. Let's see preferences. I always wanted to always stay on Top. Different dates sorry guys I had to reinstall everything on my computer, so nothing has its proper settings like before and I didn't realize I'd have to change something in pure ref. Window. I feel like it's somewhere here mode always on Top there, we go. It's under mode OK solved. Alright so let's get into the painting. There's a link to my brushes under the stream. I hope it's visible to you guys, but if you want you can check that out. And I'm going to also start the tool capture so if you watch the fide if you watch the video if you re watch the video to this dream. You should be able to see the tool timeline captures all the tools that I'm using as I'm painting. Hi Haiti's welcome thanks for coming on over good to see you. Yes, I am an artist, Digital and traditional artist. But we're doing digital art today. You don't see the brushes either. Maybe they're updating something an it's it's causing some trouble with that. The assets are the uploaded assets are visible on my end, but what I can do is maybe update the description under the? Video to include them, too, not sure if I can do that, while I'm alive. So probably not. Alright we'll see maybe it will update. OK so let's get started painting. At the very least you guys can always join the discord. There's a link to that on my profile. My Behance profile and all of the things are there? It updated OK awesome? Thank you. Well, that's good. OK so I'm going to start with a sketch like usual and I normally try to figure out where the horizon line is going to be 1st in this case. It's somewhat near the middle and I know that's not really optimal. I know we kind of try to avoid that in landscape. I think at this time it kind of fits it kind of works. So we're just going to go with it. Robert says Hey Mattie, been looking at chairs and like the look of yours. What brand was it again. Noble chairs is the is what it's what it's called? The actual model. I don't know if I have it off hand but it's Noble chairs. Oh, it's the epic thanks cow. Thank you. Epic epic chair. Haley. Good to see you. Hope you had a good weekend. So I'm just going to sketch in the mountains in the distance and you know, maybe we will exaggerate them a little bit more. I think this is actually maybe a cool opportunity to go our own way from the reference a little bit more than usual because for example. I really like the effect of the mountains in the background. But I think it might be more interesting if there more prominently there a little bit larger or maybe there's a little bit more overlapping with things. So I'm going to sketch in my own idea of how high they should be. And maybe it's not so different from the reference but. A little bit of difference here in there. Good time for share it right, it is good good sure. Yeah, this isn't like that. My favorite part of this reference my favorite part of this image is the water all the little. Trails of water and they're just silver and beautiful, reflecting light from the Sky. And it's so I don't know it's just right out of a fantasy scene like this something like this could have been in Lord of the rings. I mean, it's a little bit of a different environment, but that kind of epic that kind of level epic. Yeah. No comments it is a very supportive chair I will say that. So one thing that I'm trying to remind myself with these little. Little rivers and things is that we're getting of you very much like a for sure in view. So we're not having a straight down aerial view on these so everything is going to seem pretty narrowed and like kind of distorted or squished, but that's going to help give the? Impression that we're viewing it from this distance. So. Maybe I could even be a little bit more creative with some of these things also going to copy what I did or cut it onto a separate layer and try one more try one more time So what would be the reason that I couldn't like make my own swirls and stuff, and maybe I can actually make them like Totale Fantasy, an just interesting and maybe. Swirling through like more magical papers shapes that wouldn't necessarily exist. But maybe in this fantasy world. They do to feel like this scene has is like lending itself towards a fantasy total fantasy landscape. Waffle Amari Hi from Belgium, hello from the Netherlands Welcome. Welcome welcome. I am making a painting of the image that you see up here and it's in the description of the stream the link to the. The image so if anybody watching. Would like to you're welcome to also paint with me. Do a little study. OK, so. I don't know if I love these shapes, but I think we'll wait until we get into the painting to really make a lot of changes and figure things out more detailed. Going to merge down what I have so far. Make a new layer and. I think in this scene. I don't always sketch in clouds ahead of time, but I think there is so important. In this scene. There, a big part of why it's a beautiful scene and they're big part of the composition. So. Even though clouds are fluffy and soft. They still have based on create shapes and they can have strong shapes and mass and you know they are important to the composition so. I'm just going to sketch in like the rough outline of where the cloud shapes are going to be. Keep that in mind. And. Another thing I have to think about is the foreground so this is the thing that I want to change the most. Just because I feel like there's not enough overlap from the foreground over Top of like the mid ground and I just feel like it makes it. It's less. It looks kind of flat so. Let's try that new layer. I'm actually going to lower the opacity of what we have here and imagine that it's like in the distance and make a new layer. It will be easier to draw on Top of that and imagine that this is the foreground so over here on the left we have rocks. So that's fine, we can do that. There's like a little. Outcropping. All these different shapes and the rocks like breaking apart that's pretty cool actually. But I think I just made it a little bit bigger in mind, so it's overlapping more and maybe we could do something that really. I don't know put something on it, like maybe we could have a flag or something like somebody somebody came here and. Left their mark or something like that, and that could go up higher or we could have maybe some tree or branches growing out of that. I just think it needs something that's going higher up. If you have any ideas you're welcome to suggest. And I'll add some rocks here. And maybe we'll make this more of a Hill leading down. Instead of flat. So. Then we have trees. To do. I'm just going to put the very, very basic shapes of that reasonably little lollipops. You like the flag. I like the flag. I think I think maybe we'll go with the flag just because it's a little bit of A. Hint of a person has been here, maybe a little bit of storytelling. It doesn't really tell much of a specific story. But little hints that it's not just an all natural landscape. But there's always been there. And that that can be kind of cool. So we have trees, maybe the trees are coming up the mountain and they're going to get bigger. Maybe there's a Bush here or something. I'm just having trouble with. The way it currently looks over here, I just think it's not very interesting so. We got our lollipop trees. Let me flip this maybe that'll give me some idea what to do. What to do on the left? Maybe we could make. So part of me is like hesitant to add something that would require a lot of reference without actually finding a good reference for it like it might be nice to have a tree coming up here. But I'm worried about my ability to successfully paint that tree well without any reference for it. Maybe a Bush or something. Another thing is, we have these rocks, maybe there's like a path if we want to keep going. With the idea that like some people have been here or something like that. Maybe we can make a rocky. A little path of stones coming back up here. We can have our little flag. And. Put a bear nice one. I think a tree would be easier for me than a bear on the fly to be honest. But I think that is a cool idea. I don't know if I like the pathway a flag makes me think almost that someone has just arrived and just like put their flag in there, so I don't know if a whole pathway would be good. Yeah, let's just try a Bush. Some routes. Maybe there can be rocks over here, too, and the Bush is like. Growing out in between the rocks. Sheep to the tree. A small house that's a cute idea. If I had if I had more time. I might go with some of those options, but I think I'm going to stick with like. Organic stuff this time around just for the amount of time I have to paint this. Today I think I better stick with. Organic things I find it a little bit easier to paint on the fly. Stuff that requires perspective and things well. This should be an interesting one, I don't know how I feel about it, but yet. Let's try. So we got a sketch an I will put that on multiply. Modan lower the opacity so I can just barely see that. Oh, a sundial. Hey Power Hornet. Yogi Ali Yogi Bear, my my uncle when I was growing up used to do. Impressions of cartoon characters and he would do impression of Yogi Bear, just like making my sister laugh. So anyone who's just coming in. We're doing a landscape painting of this beautiful scene, but I'm trying to be a little bit brave and change some things up. But I'm not being quite as Braves of some some are you guys, adding bears and houses and stuff, but I am going to change up the the environment just a little bit from the reference so. That will be fun. OK, so. Yeah, we're about to start so layers on multiply. I put the Opacity 26% an unlocking it so I. Can I stream or again her reading and speaking at the same time try this again I can paint underneath the layer and not. Not accidentally paint on my sketch layer. But welcome power and I'm glad he found the stream, yeah, thanks for thanks for coming on over. Ah Mills. All during the next painting for sure. I haven't done one in awhile well. I am actually this is going to be kind of short stream is going to be out for 3 hours long story going to be about 3 hours long. We're just going to do this one painting so there's like plenty of time. If you want to join in. We only just began so it's up to you. If this one appeals to you if you like it. You're welcome to just below the stream. There's all the information with the reference image where you can get the reference image so. If you like it, you're welcome to join us on this one or you can always just do your own thing? Whatever whatever you like. So. I think I would like to do something similar to the last painting that I did hear and begin with a textured background and just kind of focus on the colours first because I think that's what's so beautiful about this image. I think if it was in black and white it wouldn't quite have the same punch. I do think the values and that bright shine. Here are really important, but the colours ads so, so much. So. I think I'm going to start out focusing on that. And. Going to grab the Airbrush. And I'm just going to try to get the right colors in the right places and then we're going to get into as soon as possible. I'll get into some texturing stuff. But I'm going to start with the Airbrush and just you know. Pretend almost that you are squinting your eyes. I don't like to actually squint my eyes and look at the references that just gives me a headache, but If you have that kind of mindset. And then we can go. Right into the green. Bright yellow green. The info tab is Top right info. Next to chat. Oh, thank you. Thanks Robert OK, cool, so I think that's where the? The the assets must have gone the. The information that we can upload here. So I'm going to now we have the Sky blocked in and I'm going to now make a selection of the? Mountains just going to use the lasso tool like a little. Stencil and block off that area. That's awesome. I'm glad you're painting along power horn. If anyone else wants to join in. You're welcome, too. I hope I hope you enjoy this painting, either way for just hanging out. So I'm going to make a selection of the opposite side. And do a little bit of a darker color. For the mountain. And so we start to get a little bit of that feed. Wow, my smudge brush does not need to be so intense. Let's see. There we go I'm going to put my smudge brush at. I usually like it were between like 10 and 30%. It was at 100, so that's way too much. Even that's too much. The assets show now but we're in there at the beginning OK. Well, I'm glad we got it working now. So. That some distant more distant mountain speaking through over here. And then below that we can begin with the green. So we want a dark blue green. Basically, we just want a nice gradient. It's going to fade from these mountains all the way. To the Area closer to us. Looks like a little bit of a mess to start off with but. Just going to merge everything. Except the sketch. So it does eventually get to be a pretty yellow. Green here and I think that's nice compared to the. More blue green. Is this kind of like an underpainting not really to be honest? This is just like just going into the painting without an underpainting. I think. I do that I tend to use an underpainting when the painting itself is. There's a few times when I'll do it. It's not always, I will always do it in this case. I just felt like the painting itself had so many different colors in it already that it didn't. I just kind of wanted to go in and start painting the color. Sometimes I use an underpainting to try to bring in extra colors that aren't really in the scene or like a color that I. Yeah, this would be a block in rightly like this isn't so much of an underpainting 'cause. It would have been. Maybe if I picked like a warm Brown or orange back there, and then started painting on Top painting on Top of it that would have been warned of an underpainting. But. I just wanted to focus on the very clean, vibrant gradient in this one. I'm sure you guys like have seen we've talked about it before an? I usually Have a different slick a tiny bit of a different workflow for different paintings and this is just something that I think all artists will have a little bit of experience with it's like you have a general workflow, but then from scene to scene or character to character whatever it is that you're doing you're going to take the steps a tiny bit different is not always going to be the same. Thanks, Robert Yeah, you can share a brush that you like. Purples I usually use I usually choose warm underpaintings. If I do use them. So it wouldn't necessarily be for Purples, it would be for something like. Like burnt orange or something a little bit more. This is me personally, I do like to add purpose. Asshat shadows and things. But that's something that I usually just paint in. I don't usually use purple as an underpainting color in my digital art. But it's not say Never do. It is just that I usually choose when I do under paintings. I usually choose warm colors. So I'm using a? Paint brush right now that's Soft, but does have a little bit of an edge and I think this is nice for starting to get some kind of texture in the Sky. So I'm just just painting what I see as the background gradient behind the clouds and then we're going to add the clouds on Top of this. Hi Liars, Who magentas to the shadows yes magentas magenta is always fun? It's funny in traditional painting how strong that pigment is I have so much magenta paint. Enjoy your frequently. Hope you're all doing good. If you have any questions, let me know. So now on the left and in the sort of middle of the canvas. I'm going to begin with just having painting in a little bit of overlapping details and things to show these. Groups of treason and stuff in between the. In between all of the. Areas of water little rivers and things so I wanted to look like there's really some depth and distance here, so we want some silhouettes of. You know mountains and we want some depth so for example, back here we have one level of blue and then we can have a darker. A darker blue here and then it starts to look like this is a little bit closer to us just like on the left. Same thing happening on the right. It's a little bit more subtle. From Brazil welcome. Welcome welcome I am from the United States, but I'm living in the Netherlands. Are you still using airbrush I am using the? Brush that's like an airbrush but it has a hard edge a little bit of a hard edge is the soft shading and blending brush. I'm just using it to now give like the first layer of. Detail to what's going on here instead of it being so, so smooth now will have a little bit of texture going on, but it's not a lot you know. So there is not I'm looking at the reference. In this area. I do see opportunity for a little bit more. Some more warmer colors than what I painted in with just the Blues and greens so they'll be opportunities for some little bit of purple and magenta is and Browns to show through. And actually be careful. I'm gonna end up just making some really muddy colors here, but Just playing with blending right now. Might even be nice to turn off the sketch layer for a little bit since I'm not actually working on the foreground. Just kind of get it out of the way so I can see what I'm painting better. This is a detailed one power Hornet my biggest suggestion is to start with like this, a simple simple gradient don't get. In there to details right at the beginning just try to paint like Blue Sky Green on the bottom get that mountain to get that hard edge for the mountain and it's amazing. It can start to look like this scene pretty quick and then you can go in and do. The details but you don't need to get in there with a small brush like at the beginning. Um. But Hey, just try to have some fun with it. And. You can share if you like but no pressure at all. Just enjoy your painting. So we get some lines of trees coming through here and I really like that look so I'm just going to skip them in same brush. I think this one is going to be challenging for me, too. It's one of those that at the beginning. It's going well. But as soon as we get to the foreground. I'm going to have my hands full of stuff. Will enjoy it feeling inspired by my last drawing that's awesome. I'm glad to hear that? That's such a good feeling you definitely gotta keep going when you're when you're feeling that kind of energies your art. Thanks hating. Yes. In fact, And. It's good to see you good to be here. I'll be keeping in touch with you guys about. Some schedule changes, I think I'm going to be announcing some schedule changes this week. Because. I'm beginning classes tonight actually I'm starting my language class again. And things are just a little crazy, so I might for the for the winter. While I'm doing a lot. An honestly just in general. Things have been so crazy for me. Lately, like I'll talk to you more about it later. But my schedule of what days I'm streaming where an everything I will. I will update you guys this week with like? How things are going to be for the winter and maybe when I. Will will will have a different schedule in the summer next year like? What we did this year. Because of the metal study now I like drawing shiny stuff. That's awesome. I love painting, shiny stuff. It's so much fun you can get a lot of. I don't know it. Just you get a lot of bang for your book with that paper texture. I feel like it's once you get, how to do it. It's it's really, really cool effects. And I think compared to some other textures, metal texture isn't necessarily the most time consuming to paint. I think that sometimes soft textures with a lot of less shiny things soft textures. Will be? A little bit more. Like detail detail intensive I don't know sorry I'm not explaining it well. That means you will be streaming earlier no no that's not going to be at Lee don't worry, it's not going to change the time, but I think. Yeah, I'll post outpost in the discord probably tonight about it. Hey Nadella, Thanks for coming. I hope you had a good weekend. OK, so. I still haven't been able to get this. Interesting shape in the in the middle here. I think I'm going to switch to a brush that's a little bit of a harder edge because as we're getting closer and closer. To the foreground, we maybe don't need such a? Such a blurry softer brush we want things to appear more solid. So. On the left. I like these little lines of trees. I'm going to paint in the shadow underneath of them. And. Hi Dinner, Welcome. And use a harder edge brush to paint in these. Little trees here. Well, they might be really big trees, actually but they're kind of far away, so they look small. I think they need to be a little bit more blue and maybe it would be nice to use. I forgot to brush settings to use color dynamics. We can check uncheck apply per tip. And this will mean that each brush stroke. I make it will have a slightly slightly different Hue depending on what I settings. I put here with the huge jitter and saturation jitter and all that stuff. So. I don't usually like to mess with the brightness jitter, too much. I think that. Changing the value. Takes too much out of my control instead of hard round brush. It is the wet paint brush in my painterly brush set it's not round. Oops. Oh, I did something bad. No. Something froze up over here. This isn't supposed to happen. I'm so this did not have tech issues now. Alright I'm just going to wait and see if my computer will unfreeze itself. 'Cause I don't want to lose my progress. Up. Do patiently waiting I wonder what I did. Looks like a flat brush. Yeah, it's the it's the it's a very nice brush. It's originally. We're back. We're back. I don't know what I did, but I'm not going to do it again. Let's save. The fact that I do alright so this is what the brush looks like. I think it has a nice look of it really reminds me of when. I'm doing gouache painting if I'm using like a round brush in my traditional painting and I. Have like a good amount of paint on the brush. This is really like the kind of effect that it has like this. This is one of the brushes that really reminds me of traditional paint. And it doesn't have the kind of stereotypical oil paint look that a lot of the brushes have that are trying to imitate traditional. I think most most of the photo shop brushes that try to imitate traditional mediums, they seem to be very. Structured around oil paint look. So I'm really kind of struggled to find stuff that. Resembles the gouache paint look that I that I like. And people just paint with different mediums in different styles. Like I've downloaded a lot of Gouache. Extra brushes photoshopped wash texture brushes and I'm just like what this isn't how. Gosh, she looks to me, it just depends how you paint with it. Funny. Like I really like the Kyle Webster Gouache brushes. I just they don't look at all like how I paint with Gouache. So I find it kind of funny but they are really nice brushes and very cool. Traditional brush textures, and I like to use them sometimes. So yeah, I'm just going around. And. Having some little trees and. Trying to show the distance between these areas. I probably shouldn't be doing so much without putting anything in the foreground honestly. But I'm enjoying this. Part of the painting so we'll do a little bit more. And then I'll go with the foreground and start cleaning stuff out, they don't regret it. Trying to clear pic there, we go that's the color. Alright I'll merge that down and let's put the sketch back and I'm going to switch brushes to something flat. Reuse the Mattie brush the classic my favorite. And. Yeah, I'm having a problem with my menus. Doesn't happen in awhile but everything's Oh my gosh everything's? Still, a weird guys, I'm sorry. I think I just have to get everything set up. I think there might be some windows ink thing I need to disable. I remember doing something with wind windows ink when I first. Got my. My centriq an now. With having reinstalled everything and I did a fresh install of everything over the weekend. I try to get everything ready for stream today, but I'm still having like little things go wrong, I might have to restart photo shop real quick. See if that does anything. But let's email says to even with working back to front big to small you still have to have most of the foreground planned out early. Yeah, I like to make sure I don't get my painting in a situation where anyone area is like too far along compared to any other area because then you run into a situation where you just can't visualize the whole scene. You just don't. You can't plan out the value structure. The colors, the composition of everything and it's. Relationship as it's working together, so I do like to plan things out in a basic way everywhere. And then you know go continue on with the detailing or am I allowed to click menus yet. Oh, OK guys I'm going to. Put on the starting soon screen here, I'm still here. But I'm going to try to. You start this. I'm sorry for that. Inconvenience. Alright I'm just gonna open my file again on the bright side everything is really. Fast I think once I get everything set up again and. It's going to be really nice. I was hoping we wouldn't have trouble today. OK, I'm back thank you for waiting. So Robert says I have windows ink enabled for photo shop. Restart usually helps the pen pressure issue OK. Thank you. Well. I hopefully I didn't lose anything too significant. I think this is basically where we were. So. Yeah, Lee I'm I'm I'm pretty happy with it, I had I got a new motherboard. New processor and knew ram and and I mean, castles with installed all that stuff over the weekend and I wiped my hard drive and we reinstalled that we installed Windows 10, so like so many. Things change for me and I'm hoping that it's going to be like a great thing. But in the short term. I have to get everything set up again, and working together and you kind of realize all these little settings and things that you have to do I thought you try to think of everything but then, when you actually go and you're using stuff that's when you realize. I gotta fix this so I gotta fix that. Fine. Not right, yeah, so it's like one of those things that is so wonderful once it's done but actually doing it all is like Oh no. But I'm hoping once everything is up and running. It's going to be really nice. So sorry again for the waiting guys. Let's get back to painting. At least we saved everything is. It's good and let's begin with the next stage, which is the rocks in the foreground So what I was saying earlier going to take them. Mattie brush, which is my favorite flat brush. It's a very, very basic flat brush. And. And I'm just going to paint in close to the most of you are close to us. I'm just going to basically fill in this sketch. I mean, you could do it by selecting with the lasso tool. I mean look at that you guys, I can paint really. I can paint pretty large now actually shouldn't shouldn't do any crazy stuff 'cause I will. Crash something but I my computer is able to paint pretty large now, which I'm really excited about. I feel your pain we? Drink so much coffee Oh no rubber. I'm on my first coffee of the day. I I like to always save my coffee for when I stream. OK, so I'm just painting in purple where I want there to be rocks. This is just a block in. Color for the rocks they're not going to be purple necessarily. There can be some graphs showing through here. But I like the look of these random random rocks. Peeking through the grass. OK, so yeah, if you look at the reference. There's a lot of purple shadows in the rocks. That's another reason to choose it's like the base color. And I'm going to lock that layer and have to decide what to do next and what I mean, is usually I'll try to decide do I want to make the do I want to do shadows 1st? Or highlights what is the more dominant thing so the rocks have pretty even amount of Shadow and highlight. I think so it doesn't make a big difference. I'm going to choose. And textured brush this is called us sponge brush in my brush set and it just has a little bit rough texture like this. So we can create a clipping mask so that's clipped onto the shape of the rocks and then just. Start painting in shadows of the rock texture. There's a couple of ways to do this. You can make a selection to make a little bit of a stencil effect again and then I can paint behind there. Are you stylizing this piece? Yes. So I almost always am stylizing? When I'm doing a virtual plane air to some degree will come out more realistic than others. But The thing is I just can't. Indiana relatively short time, like 1 to 3 hours. I can't get like super super realistic usually. So it's always my goal to Stylize, a little bit now when you say stylized you can mean anything from like? Slightly simplifying shapes too. Drawing a complete cartoon style, like there's all different levels of stylization and So what I'm trying to do when I'm stylizing is just really emphasized that shapes that I see try to kind of summarize them and do something. That makes the image like easily digestible. So. For example, to look at the scene and really understand the shapes very, very well and very in an obvious way. So I don't want to necessarily paint every little detail. I want it to be. Like a cleaner easier to look at version of the original. Buffering BV hands is quite frequent. I wonder. I wonder if that's another problem from me. I can check in after the stream. And see. The. The people here at Adobe be hands have been super helpful with like getting everything set up for the stream and helping you work through some of my tech issues and stuff, so maybe I can. Talk to them after the stream and see if something on my end is causing this problem what you guys are experiencing right now. In OBS to me everything is going good like it's all in the green there right now. But. They could still be something. Causing it that I don't know about. So the light in the scene is coming from it's very clear. You can see in the sun in the center very bright and very, very intense and also so we can keep in mind that all the shadows are all going to be on the side. The rocks that are facing to us. Over here on the right same thing. So anything on the right side of the rocks. Wherever facing us is going to be a little bit darker. So I don't like how purple the rocks are right now, but we're working our way to more natural situation soon. I'm going to create a clipping mask color pic from the Roxanne move it a little bit warmer. And see about going to the next step. So I think I'm gonna go back to the Mattie brush. Maybe an start painting in just a couple edges here and there that will have this kind of color. Alright so some of you are having it and some not so much the buffering. So I'm not sure but either way, I hope it hope it stops. For those of you who are having it so you can enjoy the stream. You're getting so much faster with rock shape, so thanks. I was actually just thinking, Man, I need to practice rock shapes. I think you're right that I am getting faster with them, but I'm also feeling puzzled about. Like. The textures right now, I'm thinking to myself, I'm trying to figure out like what brushes I want to use. You want to just. Painted in the flat brush and just kind of create all my own textures, but it can it's not we don't have time for that. In a Shorter painting session in a time study and I like the idea of you know the textured brushes. Giving some more personality to the rocks so one experiment them. It's buffering for you. OK. I'm sorry guys. Next we can make a lighter highlight finally on the rocks. Clipping mask and it's going to be something brighter and warmer and this is where the sun is hitting. And I think this would be a good time to use a texture brush. And that just seems really, really bright. Maybe we're not ready to go to that highlight yet. There is one other thing that I'm noticing about the rocks. They have a lot of blue bounce light on them. So. We can take this blue purple like periwinkle color and just start giving some. Some highlights this is light blue light from the Sky. Hitting within the some of the shadow areas. You have a 4K monitor I do not I do not. That would be cool. The rocks are really pretty thank you tell a thank you alright. Well, I appreciate the feedback you guys feel. Feel more optimistic about the rocks. I like these. Shapes with the rocks are kind of cracking apart and you get like these tears. There's no, I'm talking about. I'm going to turn off the sketch layer now 'cause I think it's just distracting me, but you get. You can't like these lines and. Areas with rocks, like breaking away. This is a sharp shadow. OK, I was kind of afraid like well. I'm going to get into too much detail but maybe I can just at least add a few of them. Yeah, up here there will be some highlights and then it will help stand help the rock stand out against the background right now, it's the edges, a bit muddy. I hope you guys are doing well if you're working on some of your own paintings and projects and things I hope it's all going well. Alright I think I do like Hella Rock is going finally. I do have to be fair to the rest of the rocks. We need to add some detail to them. If this one is going to be all fancy. So let's see. One here. We can show that breaking apart. Almost finished your first inktober prompt that's awesome. Guys I'm really excited about Inktober. Even though I'm not going to do the full prompt listen. Everything I'm really excited about just doing some ink stuff 'cause it's been so long. Also didn't did you guys, see the announcement that Jake Parker posted about in October. I thought it was so great, I was really, really happy to see that. I think that's very good vibes an needed for some people to hear. You guys can check on Twitter. If you want, but he posted a thing explaining just encouraging people to have fun with it. Not to take it too seriously or push themselves, too hard and just to be. Be kind to each other and supportive to each other not not too. Not to be policing anyones inktober. Stuff. Hi Andrew Welcome. Oh my gosh, gnutella Can you believe that? It's just snuck up on us. But that's OK, you don't have to prepare I mean. When you say you don't have anything if you don't actually have any like ink supplies that might be a problem? Could use a ballpoint pen, though? Oh, it's Andy low OK, Hey, thanks for coming. Get to see you. Um do they May 1st year participating in October. Yeah, we have to make an inktober channel in the discord. So everyone can share their October things there. Because we need more channels in the discord of course. Have alcohol markers does that count. I mean? I think it's fine. I think anytime you're painting with something that's permanent medium. It's pretty in the spirit of. October. But yeah, they're very it's flexible. Just taking a look at the time and we have 2 hours left to paint this so I'm just going to keep taking my time with the rocks because? I think there is enough time for me to do something decent with them. Gonna take my time and then will work will move on to other areas of painting in a little bit. But I do want to work on. All the rocks so we gotta get these little ones working over here on the right. This is not in the reference at all, so we gotta wing it. But we can still look at the reference like I'm still looking at the rocks. The. The left portion of. What's in the reference 'cause I can still use that to paint this? Now, Susie. Hey good to see you thanks for coming. Should I make it or do you wanna make things over channel later? Yeah, that's cool mails that that's very nice of you? Thank you if you want to make it that's that's great. I was, I wanted to pin the official prompt list. There just let everyone know they can also do whatever prompt list that they want. Oh yeah. That's right that's very waffle, you can change that, if you want to. But as long as you're OK with it. So we're painting the reference you see at the Top an I'm changing it up a little bit, not anything too, crazy, but I am doing. Adding some stuff to the right, adding some rocks and trees. I just wanted there to be more things closer up. To the viewer in the scene. I thought that it was a little bit. It was a little bit missing that. Congratz bail. I'm going to flip 'cause I've been painting from the one angle for awhile and yeah. It's the second you flip things seem a little bit wonky. But we are on the side of a mountain so. Can work? Continuing on with the details and that little bit of. Rock. Like texture of the horizontal stripes. Kind of falling apart a little bit. And I think we're ready now to add some highlights. So going to do on a separate layer in case I don't like how it goes. Another thing is, we could just go to the image adjust color balance and maybe I can brighten things up. A little bit as they are like just a little bit warmer. In the highlights shadows could be. A little bit more Siam. Have you tried painting in VR? I have not I have not at all. I've heard some good things about it? It seems fun seems like something fun to try but I have no experience but. Alright so I'm going to start with layer one of warm highlights. On Top of the rock. So I'm just looking at the reference to guide me on where these highlights are honestly. We're going to have to do a little bit. Uh applied study on the other rock 'cause we're kind of making up our own. Rock so then we can try to figure out for ourselves where the highlights are going to go. Thanks Mills, thank you for updating the discord. Yeah, so this, the highlights on the rocks are so pretty and there's so many little different Hue variations. It's going to take a couple of passes to get this looking good, I think. So there is a first pass and let you bring some highlights over here to figure out where they want to go. And then we can go a little bit later. Just a couple of places. And I want to bring more of the light blue too. I don't think I did enough of that, so color pick? What there is now. And go a little bit brighter. Little bit brighter. There we go. Feels. Feels off but I think I'm just going to commit to it. Mill so see you give the rocks. The jagged rough look by doing the highlights on a clipped layer with a rectangle brush. That is what I'm doing yes, you are following the process well. I don't know that that's necessarily. The thing that's giving it through a rough jagged look, though I think that comes with the. The shapes and I do think the contrast helps with that, but I think it has to do a lot with the shapes an the texture of the brushes like going with a little bit of a texture brush. We had is part of it. And emerged the highlights down on 2. The rock. I think it's nice to use a clipping mask Mills because I wasn't sure how I was going to like what I did I wasn't sure if it was going to be. The right choice. And how was painting it so that's why I used a clipping mask if I was feeling more confident. I could have just painted it right on to the layer like the clipping mask isn't really. Necessarily important. It's just it's more flexible. Hey Mizore good to see you miss sorry was this your. Did you find this image? I was like remembering that you found this one, but I don't know if that's correct. But Hey, good to see you. And let's see Robert says I'm thinking, Inktober has to be monochrome, but it can be colored inks, too, yes, it can. It can. And there's actually if you like the monochrome thing. With different hues, there's something called Hugh Vember. This also goes around, I guess that's November right. Q Vember is something kind of cool for that. Did this and I hate it OK? Let me see let me see what's going on? Oh, it's so cozy why do you hate it? I'm gonna share really quick this is something Missouri painted in the chat. It's really nice. This is a yeah seems like this with a lot of. With perspective and all these kind of details, architectural things. It's not necessarily easy one to do so it's good that you're practicing those hi there huxel. I like the little smoke coming out of the chimney. Alright so little more highlight on the side of the rocks facing towards. The light I can't wait to get started on the clouds. That's going to be next after just a little bit more rock painting. Yeah, those people were just coming in if you want to see the reference image. I'm using you can check the description below this stream or the info. Info button. You can download it if you like the image and if you'd like to give it a try. Very out of my comfort zone. Yeah, I understand it took me a really long time to be willing to paint buildings and houses and things I started with just purely landscapes, only natural landscapes and I wasn't interested in doing any man made structures. So. It's a big step at first. Because there's a lot of different challenges that come into it. Thank you. Thinking is already. I think it's better if you turn off the silence muting option. What does that mean? Can you explain that in another way? I'm sorry I don't know what you mean? I don't actually have any filters on OBS right now, so maybe I do need one or something but I the only thing I have is noise gate. But I don't have like sound noise suppression filter. I'd really like noise suppression filter. It usually makes me sound like underwater or something. So. Actually, a very little going on, but that there could still be something up with audio I'm trying to Figure it out after reinstalling everything over this weekend so a lot of my preferences and things were changed. Oh, it's something with with the website huxel. It's not something something with my stream. Just checking because everything is different for me from last week today. So I'm hoping that I'm not I'm not having some problems. Yeah, structures machinery all that stuff, even. Like if you're drawing a character with weapons or some kind of crazy props and stuff, those things can all be really difficult. So the perspective and. Mathematical type. Stuff that's involved sometimes. Painted on the wrong layer now. Hi Joseph, Whenever there is no loud sound in the stream. It goes absolutely silent, so gives kind of lagging effect OK well. Thank you for the feedback. I will try to listen back to the stream after it's over and see if I can improve anything. Right so I'm turning off the sketch layer. And just doing some painting, I kind of like the color green of the reference as it gets. The scene gets closer and closer to us. There's a little bit of like a soft blue green color. Yeah, I would love to see that Terra go ahead go ahead and post the link if you have one. But you see you Joseph and welcome everybody thinks axle thank you. Alright so now I'm just painting on the background. With the same brush because I'd like to get a little bit of a more consistent blend between the areas. So right now, the foreground is like very rough. Texture Wise and the background is more blurry, which is kind of nice 'cause that helps show Leica distance effect. But I don't necessarily want to be quite so drastic. I'd like it to slowly go. Slowly morph. I know belies. It kind of weird for me, too alright, so let's. See. Oh, cool, yeah, what was that what was the prompt word for this one. This is this is Taras First Inktober. Artwork. Oops sorry guys I was trying to look at it in my. Navigator window was covering. So this is cool, it looks like it's interesting because it's. Is abstract and it kind of could be eyes? It could be planets? It could be. Even olives or something I don't know, but it definitely gives me like a celestial kind of feeling to it. Like I like and eyes and planets what I'm thinking the word was ring Oh nice. Very cool. Yeah, same here Missouri. You also make abstract art. You guys are welcome to share your art if you want to there's no pressure, but if you. If you want to post yard in the chat you can do that. Alright so I want a little bit more of a warm color to the. Tops of these little Hills. And my smudge brush doesn't mean the diesel in terms. There we go. Thanks thanks to through. Um. Dabling into see back into abstract art with Inktober Little, freeing just thinking and shapes. Yeah, it's really good practice for just your design science, you know like getting group composition and shape design. Because you know all that applies to any of your other. Styles as well. OK, Cool hustle. We want to show you the portrait. I did well, you're welcome to post it if it's. Yeah, if you if you want to hear if you're like allowed to. You say that 'cause I never know. Sometimes people are working on presents or some Commission works or something and they can't show their art. You're welcome to show it if you can alright let's see we gotta link. This is cool, she's so cute. Is this like an original work original character or is it based on some idea some kind of specific character? You really nailed that texture that's so cool power Hornet. I'm glad like the metallic metallic texture stuff. We did paid off. I mean look at it's all over the place this looks awesome and the jewels in the pearls. Yeah, your textures look really good here. Wish it was original there's a lot going on there like holy cow. Hey project, thank you. Thank you thank you. Guys we should probably start painting the Sky huh? I've been kind of slacking off on that part of this. OK, so. Let's let's do it. I want to keep the foreground on separate layer. So emerged this stuff down so here's my layers right now at this as a background. I have all the rocks and then I have a sketch. And. I could again no just look at the colour balance of the rock layer and see if there's any little bit of huge thing I can do so that it, fits better in the scene. I just don't want to take all the purple away 'cause. I think it's a cool thing about it, but I also do you want it to feel like it? It belongs in the scene so? Maybe something like that, it's a little better by undo. Redo. It's OK. Yeah, let's paint some clouds. Paint some clouds so I will choose I will use the same brush right now because. I want some workers consistency and the texturing of this painting. And I think you know, we can just paint on Top. With smooth, smooth, it out those softer brush, which is to start with. Up. So I'm going to color pic to look at the look at the reference so if I color pic from the mountains here, an I pick and I go to my color wheel and I select a little bit of a lighter color and Hue shift a little bit towards purple. Maybe in and lower the opacity. I'm not opacity sorry lower the saturation that should get us closer to the color of the clouds so it wasn't right on. But. Just can colors are relative so if I'm painting the clouds right next to the mountain. It kinda helps me decide what color to paint the clouds if I start with the color of the mountain and paint pick a color of the clouds like in. In proportion to that. So. Again, I've changed a few things about this scene, I made the mountains more. At all on the left. I think it's going to be easier to. Paint and maybe a little bit more of the purple then needed and then. Add some highlights but it's going to be back and forth is going to be back and forth here, so that's Why? I'm just going to keep working on a separate layer. Nice color for the center here it's so bright. There we go. I'm just going to keep going with. The clouds over here. And I want a little bit of these soft Misty kind of clouds. So I'm just going to do the same brush. I have transfer on the brush settings. So I can just paint a little bit lighter and it should. Should be fine we flip the reference? You can also paint in with a hard edge brush and then use the smudge brush to make a little bit. Of soft like dissolve feeling to the clouds. Because I think that's really pretty. So I want to introduce that. Warmer color 2. So to be honest, I don't I haven't done a ton of cloud. Painting. And. I would like to do some. Some I've done cloud painting within within. Landscape painting, but I want to do some actual cloud studies. Soon am I think that will that will help with painting these in the landscape scenes. Paint clouds with FF it's the best cloud. Thanks hope so. I think that to get a cloud cloud scape like this, you have a lot of overlapping different kinds of clouds like wispy ones, and then you have. You know, some more bold clouds on Top, but have a more defined shape. You gotta kind of layer the clouds to get. You know to where you want. So I'm choosing you brush that's called flat wispy it sounds like a good one for cloud painting right. This is also one that I like to use for clouds that are. You know would be has a very soft look through it. So instead of painting with a hard or brush and smashing it out. You could actually just use a softer brush. But I kind of like to use a combination of all these things 'cause. I don't know what I like yet and sometimes I feel like really mixing it up a lot helps get all the different textures that are present in a certain situation. So. New layer and let's start with some of the darker purple clouds. So I'm actually going to color pic from the rocks just as like a starting point. And I think it needs to be more purple, I think maybe the. More more saturation. And when I paint clouds. I often like to paint circular shapes with my brush because I find that that's often just more reminiscent of how they how they move and they kind of expand out and balloon out so. It works pretty well to just make little circular. You can make them more round or more flat, but make these kind of strokes. Oh, thank you Axel, I really appreciate that. Thank you. So the Camera view is. Often these virtual Plein Air paintings, they kind of have this fish. I look because the A lot of times the Camera lens just that's what it's doing so. I kind of I don't mind it. I kind of like it. Actually, I think it's cool. It's a little bit cinematic, sometimes so. I'm just you can see how the the angle of the clouds is shifting from over here. And then kind of flaring towards us and then out over into this direction. Sorry. No, it's it's OK. Jake Parker said that the October. Police are are fired their disbanded. Nobody nobody will be policing. Your work this year. I love that he made an actual announcement about that, like my favorite thing. Let's see I will I will find it for you? Real quick. Yeah, guys read this. There you go. Cool, thank you very cinematic already that makes me happy. Good to hear. This the scene when I first saw the references just reminded me of like the opening opening shot to a movie or something some kind of epic setting. Yeah. Yeah, don't worry. I love it. He made an announcement about that. Since I think you got a little out of hand with people being too worried about following rules and kind of policing each other and so I like that, he made an announcement about it and. Hopefully, that will have a more positive effects on how the community. Axe surrounding October. Yeah, so I'm just using this much brush to get rid of a couple edges here and there. And can merge this down, I might get to the point of merging this to the Sky soon. I think I think it might actually be nicer. 'Cause then when I use the smudge brush. I'm just going to do it, then why is this much brush it's going to just much all the layers? We can get some more. Interesting effects. Wanna dark in this? A little bit more here. OK, so you later and we can keep going the clouds are a multiple stage process. Not able to get everything at once. So it's going to be, it's going to take a little bit. Me too. I love this much brush. These are all the time. And mostly is it just too soft and hard edges. When I use either hard brushes or the lasso tool airbrush combo. I don't necessarily like paint with this much brush. I know some people involve it in their process in a different way. I'm always open to that, but I usually just use it for the edge control. By Tara thanks for sharing your inktober piece. See you later. So right now, it's going to get a little bit. Messier before it gets better, but what I'm doing is painting in a bunch of the shadows that are blocking the light and after this we're going to do one more layer where we're going to go to the highlight layer next and then we'll have some more sharpness to the edges and stuff is will be able to bring that right hard light coming through so right now, I might be painting in more shadows. Then I need and I'm just kind of going for it 'cause. This is going to get partially covered in the next. Please. But there's just so many. So many levels and layers and details. I feel like you could take it this as far as you wanted to. With like how much time you want to spend and how much detail. You want to get into. I do want to make this area. A little bit more intense. This is a really cool spot in the cloud and it's important compositionally. I think that there's like some weight to a couple of these spots so I need to darken them up. So one thing that helps is if you're a painting from reference and you do want to resemble the reference. I mean, I haven't been so strict with it, but looking making this smaller you can really see the difference is so. Again, I'm just kind of taking the shapes that I like from the reference and doing my own thing with the scene. But if you're doing a study that you want to really be. On with the reference that's something that can help checking your processes like to view it really, really zoomed out. Right so I'm going to smudge a couple things in and then we're going to go to highlights. OK, new layer. And. Big. Hard brush I think. Maybe this one. All right and so now we can make this edge more defined. We can paint over. The edges of the cloud. With that bright light and so we're kind of painting in the silver lining sort of effect and in between here and anywhere, we want. You know you can look at the reference to see where it makes sense. Where to go? And there's more colors, you know, we can paint also a warmer color going around more pink. Gotta go next to be here if you guys. See you marry by Huxel. Thanks for hanging out have a good day. Do you stick to one brush for most of the painting and changed more appropriate brushes later or try to choose the right brush based on the objects. That's a good question. Sometimes it just depends on my mood that day for example. There are times where I use like only one or 2 brushes for the whole painting and I honestly don't know why that is. It just kind of get into groove with those brushes and they seem to be doing the job but. Usually I kind of stick to some more basic brushes at the beginning. When I'm blocking things in and then when I start to get further along in the process and start painting more specific individual textures for different things. Then I'll I'll start getting into more like specialized brushes sometimes. Yeah, that's it's it depends so much on the look. I want for the scene like it's nice to be consistent with your brushes like if you have a few brushes that you use? For a for a scene then you're going to end up with more consistent look. This is just a generalization you know, people can make all kinds of stuff actually work for them, but you know the generally the more brushes. You try to use in one scene and have it look like it's a consistent style. It can be more more challenging to like bring everything together with those all these different textures of the brushes have and then it starts to look. You know a little crazy, so I try not to use a ton of different brushes. Sometimes I have brushes that only have a very slightly different texture than another one, they look really cohesive together at least I hope so. But it's so nice if you. Are able to like overtime? You just get familiar with your brush set and then? When you see a certain texture. You start to think right away like what you can choose that will help you achieve that texture more quickly. And I do a lot of the time to paint things so that's really great for me. I think if you are just rendering everything out. You can just pick with the hard round brush all the time if you want you know. I like to. You some texture brushes and some brushes that simulate more traditional painting an? Those kind of things. But it's so much personal preference. So the highlights bringing in the warm glow and I'm starting to like this scene better. Emerge that down, make a new layer and it's surprising sometimes what kind of brushes. You can use in different places like for example, let's try. This one. Shadi brushes when I usually use for rock painting, but you can use it in the Sky 2. Like clouds, sometimes have. You know textures weather like dissolving and stuff, I think it's important just to be consistent throughout the painting. There's a fresh that might be good for this also I recently added a few brushes to my brush set so I'm still like trying them out and enjoying them and seeing if they're going to be permanent in my rotation. But I do like this very, very, very tiny spot of light down here. It's like a couple areas that are breaking through. The clouds and we get like the bright bright glow. Like the color variety, you have in the Sky. Thank you Mills. Feels like early morning. That's cool. I wonder what time of day, it really is. I have a hard time sometimes when I look at photos. Detecting if it's the sunset or sunrise. But I'm happy if it has like a peaceful feeling. And add some more less saturated Grays into the clouds as I'm going really like fantasy with all these Purples, which is possible sunsets and sunrises have crazy colors, so it's all possible. So I think I need to add some more blue very, very light blue coming through here right in the middle. Looking at this now, one thing that I think a mistake that I made is I kind of. Put like even space in between things a little bit so for example, I can fix it now. What I'm going to do is make a selection of the mountain here? They only want to really mess with the clouds. So it's going to be convenient. If I copy. This on to another layer. So just layer new layer via copy or control J and now I can do stuff with the Sky usually. But I think I'm going to. Just copy this little section of Sky. So this little area right here. And then Squish it down. Because it's a little bit more narrow in the. In the reference so it's a bit messy after paint over some stuff but the idea is. It's going to leave a larger opening in the clouds in the center. I think that might be nice. What I had? I felt a little bit, too, like the size of a cloud was the same as the size. The opening and then we go to the next layer of clouds. Too matchy matchy. Yeah, so I'm going to merge that down. Then I can smudge brush out some of these places where you see the? The line there. And again merge the? Background together again, and it's like it never happened. I also I really love using layer blending modes like overlay and color Dodge for painting clouds. We haven't done it yet, but you know it's going to happen before the end. We're going to add some color Dodge to be careful. We don't over expose it too much. But. That's the kind of situation that you get with these. Sometimes, like in real life. When you're looking at the Sky. Sometimes it really does have that effect is just so, so bright so it could be fun to add a little bit. Alright so I'm gonna grab a soft. Brush and just add some of these little individual Tufts. I also have some brushes they often like to use for clouds. One of them is called pastel soft fluffy. Anything called soft fluffy is probably good for clouds. And it has a little bit of texture at the end. Just nice 'cause clouds have a little bit of texture. Going to pop a little bit more highlights in the edges. Little silver lining and then we're going to go to the next stage almost passed. Almost ready to move on. The next thing. And the the water reflection, it's gonna be so good. I think that's what made me want to paint this scene anyway. So looking forward to doing that part. I like the little bit of a squirrel thing that's happening here. Being color pick the Sky paint back over Top. Just trying to bring in some shapes to the edges, a little bit, but I feel like I ended up with a lot of very, very soft edge? Is there are some hard edges. Cloud. Scenario. But I think clouds cloud painting just takes a little bit of time. If it's a crazy set skyscape. I'm going to take much time we have left we were doing pretty good. We have, like an hour and 15 minutes or so left of stream so I think we'll be able to. Get something nice way to end here. Thanks Mills I was just thinking that. I think it's going to happen. OK, so merge that down. Look my canvas slip the. Reference. So here's what I was talking about. After doing some painting, I think it's time now to come in and. And we can one little brush stroke here, but we're going to do. New layer going to put it on multiply, I think. Want to add some shadows around the outside to make this a little bit more Moody Maybe. It's a little bit darker. Looking like little thing it around the Sky. Not everywhere just the Sky. And. Then I'm going to make a new layer and put it on, Black paint bucket on the layer put that on color Dodge. And I'm going to pick a warm color warm light color and just test it out. OK so that's really bright of course. But I think it's perfect. So I'm just going to use the Airbrush and. Lightly tap in this really bright colour. Maybe all lower. The Opacity, a little bit. I don't over expose it like crazy, but I do like that glow. Specially right on the edges of the. The clouds. All thank you. I'm glad you like it thanks thanks and tell her. So. Alright I'm going to go back to the. Textured brush the soft and fluffy brush. And just actually paint on this color, Dodge mode, so it's going to give a little bit more of like almost electric effect. Where the brush strokes are? Maybe I will make it a little bit warmer. So we're going to get some very, very intense. Lines of color. Oh, you're fine gnutella. Hope I hope you're doing good. This weekend went really fast. I'll thank you. Angelica thank you welcome. Thank you for the nice comments. We're doing a little virtual clean air. If anyone's just coming in and you want to see the reference you can check the information or. Below the stream. There's a link I'm changing things a little bit from the reference and there's a lot, that's the same. But changing a couple things to my liking. Having fun with it. Yeah, so I like that little. Extra light. I gotta be careful that we don't overdo it, too much in areas away from the focal point. But a little bit is good specially if it's kind of showing that. Rays of light effect. Which we get back here actually get like the Rays coming down? So I'm going to do on a separate layer. Do the same thing. But I think it's gonna work better coming from. The airbrush like lasso tool airbrush sort of thing, so I'm just going to select the area that I want light Rays to be coming down. And then Make a little stencil. And then we'll do that so. Got the airbrush. Super 8. Try this. Like maybe we can even add more than what there is. I want to try the flat brush. At such a fun effect, Oh my gosh, it never gets old. Some people might disagree about that, but I think it doesn't. I think not. But it's really important to get the angle. All coming from the same place. Really sells it better. We try flipping. And I think you want to have a different size to the light Rays. Like we don't want the same thickness. Everywhere then it doesn't feel. Very believable. Nice light Rays thanks. There's so much fun. We can have some labor is coming out the other side, too. Hey buddy, it's reaching Raccoon, a welcome baptised welcome welcome thanks for coming over. Hope you having a good day. Right so I think I like it. And I can go Walmart that stuff down. So now we have. This background layer. This in the foreground. The sketch layer still needs a lot of work. I'm going to make a new layer an created clipping mask onto the rock layer and use the Airbrush. I'm going to put the layer on multiply and just use the airbrush to give some soft shading. I'm picking a dark blue color for this and I hope that it will make the rocks look more fit into the environment. There's right now they almost seem like they're painted in a different style and kind of like pasted on Top of everything so I've used a lot of soft brushes in the other aspects of this painting an I use mostly hard brushes on the rocks. So I'm just going to use that soft airbrush shade, a little bit on the rocks here and try to make them look like they belong with the rest of this so I think that helps a little bit. We could do the same thing with the highlights. Can try overlay and I can apply some bright highlights to the rocks? And also use the airbrush for that, so I'm going to first start with a scion colored. Airbrush just to add a little bit of bounce light. Like that. Have to do watercolor painting of a landscape with only one color for my school. That's a cool challenge. Do you know what color that you're going to pick do you get to pick or was the colour also assigned to you right good luck. I hope it goes well. That is definitely a challenge. Emerge that down. Maybe I should also do color Dodge on the rocks now getting color Dodge Happy But. It's fun. Tricolor Dodge just try it. It's a little bit of a little bit of a glow. Never heard anybody. Yeah, I think it's cool. I get to pick but I still don't know what I'm going to use. Yeah, that's tough to decide. In my head when when I was just reading what you said about the challenge for some reason I imagined like blue like an ultramarine blue or something. I would suggest. Picking a color that has the potential to get pretty dark in its darker state, but that's that's just it's all it's all up to you. It's your project, but I think for example, painting with like yellow or something really light that doesn't have the can't achieve like dark value that would be really hard to do. So I don't know maybe that helps. Hey George, thank you. Thank you so much. I am working from. Reference that say, I found it through map crunch.com and it's from. Actually, Google Street View Crazy awesome stuff on there for practicing. Painting landscapes and things. You guys, I think I'm actually gonna go zoom in and blur out some of these. Some of these details that I sketched him on the rock. I'm still think it's just too. Sharp compared to the rest of the painting is just bothering me how sharpies edges are so I'm using this much brush and I'm just going to. Blend some of them out where I don't think there need needed that there so sharp. And then will just paint on Top of it. If you have any questions or anything. Let me know. And if you like the reference and you want to give it a shot you're welcome to paint with me. Right it's a little better. And I would choose purple if ever do it, yeah, the one color painting. Yeah, purple forget color. I think maybe I would choose maybe blue or green. Blue greens and Purples all my favorite colors? Can you see why, why this reference appealed to me. It has all the things that I really like. So I'm going to bring a little bit more rim lighting up here. Highlights facing towards the light source. One thing I want to do that. We haven't got a chance to do yet is I want to bring in. A lot more. Little Bush is and little things that will make a blend between the Rock and the environment is right now, it's just like the rocks and then smooth grass. So I'd really like to add some little little plants and grasses and things to make a smoother transition. Yeah, people can get really dark substitutes Blackwell, but that depends on how your colors are yeah, exactly I like to use purple for that. I think that's the case in this painting, too well. I guess you could say this is kind of dark blue but it certainly looks purple. Alright so. Let's see going to make a new layer underneath of the layer with the rocks and. Let's get some dark green here. This is what kind of what I was just talking about. I feel like there's this disconnect between the rocks in the environment 'cause I just. They're kind of the same kind of pasted on. So. Part of it has to do with the value like they really are sitting right on Top of it, they would have a shadow behind them. Since the light is so intense. You know this would all be. Something something like that would maybe be a little bit better, and Little Tufts of grass and stuff, they would all create little shadows and things. So let's flip. Yeah, that looks a lot better. Get God Rays, thank you. Mrs with the rivers and back be similar color to the God Rays. Yeah, yeah, they would I would actually when I get to those. I would actually kind of base it off of exactly what they are reflecting so for example, I would probably pick like the really bright color in the Sky to use for the area right below it. Saying it could be really, really bright, but what I would do is do the whole shape 1st and then apply a gradient to it. I'll be getting to that soon so let me just finish what I'm doing the foreground and then I'll show you like exactly how I think. It would be the easiest way to your paint those. Little River things 'cause I think that we can get. Use a method that will make it not too. Not too crazy to do. Not too labor intensive. Oops. I wanted to try this brush for some of the grass is an I don't think that's going to work. Sometimes rake brushes and things are fun to use for this kind of. Situation because it looks you know it has that look of like traditional painting. But it's And it can it does the job of making it look like there's there's grass is here, but it looks as if it's done in one brush stroke kind of thing. These can be cool but. I don't know if it's exactly. I want. Somewhere, along the way I found a brush that I liked and lost it. I did. It was a rake brush then go back through some my old brush sets and see if I can find it again. Yeah, I just want to give a little texture. I don't know if that's too much. We don't have all day so I can't. Start going in crazy detail. Alright I will work on the rivers now and then we'll come back to the foreground. But I think it's at least better than it was before. So on a new layer. Between the background and the rocks. I'm going to take the flat brush. And. Just pick a very bright color just so I can see it very easily against the background. And I'm going to only worry about the. Shape of these rivers. I'm not going to worry about the colour because this is too bright for most of the area, but I'm not concerned. With that right now. I want to only think about what shape the rivers are so I'm looking at the reference. Going off of that. And. I think this flat brush works really well because it makes a very thin. Stroke that looks kind of similar to the way these are these rivers are like flattened out. Because of our view. And there's little rivers back here. You can zoom in on the reference and get a closer look. I honestly I'm not zooming in. Right now 'cause I. It can be nice also to not zoom in. Because then you kind of focus on the big picture, so I'm just looking at the most prominent. Areas of water and. I like that there's this one area that it kind of splits off into multiple. Also, you don't have to put them exactly where they are in the reference. We can do our own thing a little bit. I was thinking earlier, about making totally like fantasy shapes and swirls and the with the water. No. There's another. There's actually a few areas back here. Locate a control Z. Take me awhile to get there right. Angle. And also erase out. Cut back into the paint stroke to get a different thickness. More natural look. And then this one comes like this. Well, that would be softer curve. Let's try that again. I do think it's pretty if you change the thickness here and there like the width of the line for something like this. Maybe these can match up, I don't know that doesn't seem seem right. This ones. Make that more grounded. Almost done. The stage. It's so easy to make them to make them not flat enough. It doesn't. I don't know why but it's so easy to do so. Over here, we can like. Squish them a little bit. Just reads better it's I don't know why it is that even though I. I know I'm looking at this and like I know I need to make it really fly still painted too much like you're getting an aerial view. You know you really wanna. Because I could have done that all together. This whole area could use that so let's just do like this. Just let it. Lisa is getting a head start on October 1st one is done. Let's see. View the movie The ring. I actually never saw this like one of the one of the only people but. You got that you definitely got a nice creepy result here anatomy on the hand and this arm for shortenings all really cool. Yeah, I'm not like super big in through scary movies. Do you like a good zombie movie? But. Right so a little bit. You can also erase out a little bit here and there, because there could be trees or other things, blocking your view of the water and that kind of seems believable if you have like these little. Little breaks in it here in there, so you can just kind of scribble with your eraser. Reset a little bit. Really was Alright Oh man. You guys are brief. OK, so I duplicate the layer and flattened it down just 'cause I wanted to make sure that my drawing had 100% opacity to it. And. I think I'm going to pop in its couple tiny couple extra little water spots. I want to overdo it might be overdoing it. OK, so. Now let's. Do the next step. Which is going to be locking the transparency so lock that affair now anything that we paint within the layer of the. Water is only going to affect that shape so we can make this whatever color we want. So. So now I would like to take the airbrush color pic from the Sky and the Sky is what's being reflected in the water. So basically as you go through you can kind of color. Pic from the Sky and bring those colors down into the water and that's going to make a little bit more of a realistic reflection and then you can really bump up the the light in a couple of spots like so for example. Over here, we're getting a nice glow. From some of the Rays coming over and hitting this spot. Like you can just look at the reference for some pants on where to put the shiny stuff. I think I missed. Cool spot. Like 1, Baker area in the water that I missed here. Get that in. Maybe it maybe not. Maybe it's better without it. OK. So I think I'm going to merge that down and then do like some extra color Dodge stuff to it. Maybe it's eonism. Soon, as I'm happy with what we have here. Right so I'm gonna try emerging this down. And then Make a new layer. With that I'm color Dodge or maybe even overlay. The Airbrush. Let's do the same thing with black paint bucket on the layer and now we can play with these kind of highlights. Like a warm light here. So I'm going to get a new layer put an overlaying try that I want to bring in the little bit of warm color here so. I'm going to find the right Hue. Thank you. Messing around until I find something I like. Fairly tricky one. Maybe screen or soft light would also be good. Sometimes you just gotta play with the layer modes until you find 1. There we go screen. I think I like screen mode. So. But some warm glow. Just a little bit of like a? A hazy. Atmosphere. And it brings the colors from the clouds down. Now we can go to overlay maybe. For some surrounding area. Murder Pasetti 'cause that was a bit too much darkening. And now we can try again with color Dodge 'cause I really want to color Dodge just like some small areas. So. For example, Just like really, really school, but I'm going to do is make a selection because I think I want a glow effect. But I feel like I only want it. I kind of want it above the water. Can't decide what I want. Little specks over there on the left is that hobbits is on a journey. It could be. Unfortunately, they didn't get to spend too much time in like. I guess they had a riven, though thinking back. It's like they had to go through a lot of brutal places so we've been a good one good one for them. On a Field Trip Hobbits is on a field trip. Yeah, we could be aglow. It's so fun. It's so fun. This is the part we've been waiting for. I am going to over do it. Not trying to but I can see. So we got to stay zoomed out and take a look at it from this. Preview. So I don't go too far, yeah. Like glow you can also use a normal mode to do a nice glow effect. But there's a glow all the way out here. Thanks we My goal is your setup are you on a tablet. I am using a welcome centriq that 22 HD and. My PC so I'm not on a tablet like A. You have a drawing tablet screen tablet, but it's not like. Yeah, it's a PC. Hi friends, thank you. Thank you. Thank you with colors make me really happy. Alright I'm going to merge everything down now with the background. And let's see how it's going with the the rocks do you guys remember when I was going to add like a flag and stuff? I don't really think it needs it now like I think it I think it was. I think I'm I'm liking how it's going so far, it will see maybe we will add one but. Make a new layer go to. Flat brush and I just want to keep going. With this reflected light on the rocks. I feel like I must have made the rocks way too dark to start with 'cause I've been ever. Since then, the whole painting process. I've just been like trying to lighten these rocks. So. Let's keep going. Really epic landscape, thank you. It is so beautiful. Doing these virtual Plein Air paintings is giving me a really different perspective on like. World geography, I've learned about a lot of different places and. Sort of I don't know discovered more beautiful places that I never really thought about before. This this landscape for example, is in Mongolia. So gorgeous. Bring a little bit of that blue bounce light. But trying to keep the layers with that whole feeling of the rows of the Rock 'cause. It's Seems to be breaking off cool angles. It's really, really pretty. So there's no reference for this rock on the rights. I'm just kind of following what I did on the left from the photo and trying to come up with our own rock shapes that still feel like they fit together. And we're going to add in some more plants and stuff now. 'Cause I think it would be the case. That we have. Some. Leaves and plants growing up in front of rocks and stuff. Let's see how to handle that our random brush stroke in the Sky that was an accident. Alright so emerge that down. But I do like the blue coming in closer to us. I think that's important. I'm going to add a little bit more of that now that I'm noticing it's definitely helping. The Blue Sky showing up on these rocks. Oh, sorry guys there's Neighbors dogs being loud. OK. Here. Also, there's trees. There's trees, let's see if we can put some of those in so down on the. Mountain side. Facing downward there's trees and I'm looking to see if I have a? A brush that gives a very. Textured look. Because it be nice if I could just kind of indicate these trees with a few brushstrokes so I have to keep it very. Keep a very loose and focus on the shape of the full. Tree and not worry too much about details. They'll go in the background. Thanks Mills. It might work going to lock the layer and. But some warm color to the trees. The idea is that some of them are closer to us some of them are further away. So. I'm going to start with some relatively lighter valued trees, so like not as dark shading and then we'll add some that are closer to us that are going to get darker and start feeling closer and closer to foreground. And there's just random little. Little. Thoughts down here they're all like little bushes and trees and stuff. All the way into the background here can sneak some of those they gotta be careful. We will go to dark near the glow or it's going to stand out. Not in good way. Little tree lines kind of lost some of the tree lines over here. I hope you guys are having a good day, thanks for hanging out here. Everything's going well, whatever you're working on. Mills I think that purple shadows just make everything look magical that's what I've learned recently. Add Purple Shadows Magical. Right I was supposed to be painting trees. I don't know what happened. I really carried away. Let's go down here. More trees, you actually see like an intense shadow. There's some big trees, down here. I guess and you can see cash shadow behind them so. I'll do that, too. Is a Google Maps Street View yes exactly exactly? You can. See the location if you want below the. Load the stream there's a link if you want to open up the 360 view. It's it was bound through map crunch. Which is a website that takes the Google Street View images and kind of? Arranges them in a way where you can get random images. You can sort through random images. It's pretty addicting actually I love looking for stuff there and it's. Sucks you in like I under spending a bit of time. Just clicking through and finding cool spots. It's like a little bit of its own hobby now. I really like to just look through there and find stuff to Paden. Just. Expand your visual libraries, see new things. In the discord there's a there's a discord channel in my server where. Me and other people in the community to like to search for these we post the link that good places. Good fines for painting so if you ever want to save yourself. The time of doing all the searching you can check out that Channel, 'cause there's a lot of good ones in there. Never find good spots when using map crunch really yeah. There's there's certain ways that I've kind of. Sounds too. Find better places like I do end up zooming in a lot sometimes on the map in. Just going to places that I suspect you're going to have nice spots like looking for. Places near water rivers, coastal stuff. Yeah, sometimes if I go if I go the totally random approach. I don't get the best ones. But sometimes I've gotten some good ones. I do think I've gotten some good look on there will say that. There's also the sheer amount of time spent. Oh boy that's a lot. OK, so. Work on the foreground textures, a little bit. I think it's still pretty rough. And we have about 30 minutes left. That was fast. So. Definitely wanna. Use the 30 minutes to the best. Can. I think I think those sites are better for urban sketching. Yeah, definitely there's a lot of you can find a lot of.' City and neighborhood stuff there, too. Thanks, Robert. I was hoping. I would like to go here. Wonder there's ever been like a movie filmed here or something. Looks like a good place. Or something like that. Alright so now let's try layer two of trees. So we'll pick tool. Neither the brush and I want to pick a dark green that's going to appear to be closer to us. And then you put some. Trees. Add a little bit larger. Not super happy with that let's try. You shifting it's a little warmer. Darker. Remind me of King Arthur with Clive Owen. That's cool Jeremy. Yeah, it's like that's really the vive it's like something. Very very epic and could be timeless like I could see something like that. I could also see something almost like prehistoric like I can see like a Dinosaur walking through this place or something like it's really interesting very interesting place. So another tree over here. Little bit darker. Well, I'm not super happy with how the trees look but. I also feel like I need to keep going and just work on integrating this whole area in the foreground and maybe I will be happier with it after that. Because there's a lot of things in this area that are just not driving yet so. I'll do some more work and then we'll see. See trying to teach a student how to do is 2D art better. Sometimes he rushes his work or makes it too dark. Yeah, I think those are definitely very like normal, especially early on. Things. Yeah, that stuff. Like I use timers to help me not spend too much time on something but maybe he could use a timer for like the opposite thing and spend more time. I'm not sure if that, really works that way or not, that would help. Missouri first day of inktober let's see. Oh, you guys are definitely going there. These are definitely getting in like the Halloween vives, but there's a lot of like overlap with that. This is Missouri's ring inspired into rupees. I feel like in October. It doesn't necessarily have to be spooky or Halloween. But there's a bit of a mood overlap with that there's a lot of a lot of the prompt words, I think could be taken in a spooky way. And there's a lot of Inktober lists are Halloween themed is just something about the medium, too, like I love Inc. But it's so. It just is intrinsically dark and so it kind of can lend itself to some more spooky look. I think the the medium that you use? Really influences your will of course, influences your art, but but beyond that. I can't influence your subject matter to like. I really think that when I when I was doing ink work in the past. I did a lot of like darker subject matter. And I don't know it just it would just happen. Oh, thank you gnutella. Thank you that makes me really happy have a good rest of the day. And see you later. Skin itching now the first prompt and it's so much fun nice power Hornet. I'm looking forward to Thursday, this week. I'm going to be doing some. Traditional art. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry that was really loud. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. I had a timer on from something that I had to put a timer on yesterday. An I forgot. It was still on so I hope you're all well. You're probably a week. Now I don't know how well my microphone picked it up, but knowing my microphone. Y'all got a really loud alarm there so I'm sorry. Oh Alright Skip back in the painting. Going to make a new layer above the layer of the. Rocks and I want to start overlapping some greenery and and Bush is and things. So it's not just yeah 'cause. It says it feels a little bit fake to me that there's there's this layering and there's nothing coming back on Top so. Let's put a Bush here or or just have a little bit of grass is coming up. I'm just trying to figure out. The texture that I want for that. So. Yeah, I'm going to look at the windows ink thing. After this stream. There's some weird stuff going on still. Maybe we can get rid of that. Where did my brush pen capsules time to try this inktober bays? Enjoy enjoy. It's been too long for me. Too long since I've done ink stuff, so really enjoying it used to be my main medium before I got into digital. Digital art. Things to do only pen and ink stuff all pending all the time. So I'm just going to do some individual little. Grass is Um. I have a 22 inch centriq, but Michaels asking would you suggest the 16 for starters ever we come into us with pen kinda hard to draw we're not looking? Yeah, in your case it sounds like that would be a really good option for you, I. I personally love working on this antique. We talked about this we talk about this a lot in various streams. It's It's it's one of those things where you certainly don't need a centriq into us is great and a lot of people are doing awesome work on it. A lot of professionals use it. But I had the same kind of experience I found it really tough to. Paint and look in a different area and for me, transitioning from traditional it was a lot more. Natural for me too. To be able to draw and look at the same place you know to draw on the screen. So if you're feeling that way. I think it would be good option. I think so. I haven't tried or seen in person. The 16 inch centriq, but I can say that I'm really happy with 22. I have seen the 13 and tried it and that one was a little bit smaller than I would prefer for painting so I think that the difference between the 13 and 16 could be really. I think that that would be a pretty big difference and I think I think you probably be happy with it. Robert says I'm running through the fields in your pig. Add thank you. Thank you guys, it's almost done. Just trying to get this last little. Bit feeling more cookie so here. In the foreground. By mizore see you tomorrow have a good evening. Yeah, whatever you're thinking about for your tablet. You know watch a lot of videos. I'm not sure if other brands have this sort of thing, but I know welcome has a Like an experience center that you might be able to go to depending on where you live so before I bought my tablet. I went in person an tried it and. I had to drive pretty far to do that, but it would think it's worth it. If you can so it was like. An hour or so away. So there might be 1 year you there may not be and so in that case. Then you kinda just have to look at online tutorial not tutorials, but reviews and stuff. Awesome thank you Michael. Well, I hope. I hope it works, but it works out for you with that. If I turn it into black and white that might help me figure out what's going on in the foreground here. It's nice to have time to be able to. Coming here and work on these things at the end. I often do a lot of the time studies that are. Know about half of this time frame. So it's nice to be able to come in here and workout this these things. Try to get to a good level of finish at the end. Yeah, I think we can have more green, catching the light so maybe for example. Some little grasses and things coming up here. I think it would be maybe darker. And then if it comes up above the. That rock. Maybe we get it by the light and have more of like a bright green. Warmer color. Something like that. And maybe we can have some to have different. Type of texture like maybe some individual leaves something more like a Bush rather than. Then. Reeds or I don't know what he called that like. Pulling a blank. But you will get a Bush with some larger leaves here. Instead of just like the grass is. A Jackson thank you. Thank you so much welcome do you remember this one I think it was suggested recently? I really like the reference so I'm going to do it now. Body like it, I changed a few things about it not too much, but I wanted to. Do a little bit more with the foreground. I added some rocks and stuff, it's not. Still, not right on yet but. Go a little bit more do a little bit more. Foliage up here that would be nice. Not be happy. We need the textured brush just do. Bring in some scraggly texture here, we can pay on Top of it. Sometimes in a pinch it's really nice too. Combine. Painting your own textures, with a little bit of extra brushes, so they can get you started and then you can come in and. Add. Pain on Top of it, so you're able to get a little bit more done. Dark in this just going to keep everything pretty dark in between here. I think I'm just gonna drag in this whole area. Decisions decisions. But yeah, I think for like the dark increases in between the rocks we can definitely use the darkest shadow. Then I read a little bit more crisp. And where is that? Shadi texture brush 'cause I think we can come in at this stage and maybe add some real texture. See the rocks that are closest to us as we would actually be seeing them close enough to. Pick that up. I don't want to add too much texture like this on rocks that are or details that are too far away in the distance of the scene. Hope you guys are doing well, it's been a very sleepy few days in the Netherlands. It's just actually even last week. It's just been very rainy today was so nice actually. I I didn't get to go outside yet, but maybe after this, I will actually sunny. Thanks, Eric. Thank you so much. I got this on map grants yesterday that was nice. Alright let me take a look at what you found. Oh, this is a nice one. I like that there's some some animals in here to some goats. That's cool. There's some really, really cool scenes in that area. I've seen some good references in Bhutan. What a unique place? Oh, I covered the chat There you are. Feel like we learned completely different skill set from the speed studies. I think both help us in different ways. You mean the ones like this, where we're taking a little longer to do it. And I'm glad to hear that. Yeah, I think there is different things that come into play. When you take a little bit longer on a painting you have to get into some more things with polishing and stuff, and slightly different. Slightly different workflow things when you get to that stage. Speaking of soon. I will start to just do finishing effects, and things were getting to that point. Thank you. Thank you very much. Add a little bit more texture on this Bush over here. Some warm warm fixture. Maybe not that warm. We still want it to match the color scheme of the painting. But. Maybe something more purple. Back it up back it up. Not find the right color. There we go. Better. All right over here, I want to kind of the same thing. We gotta add some little grass is foliage, something interesting. Over here. Facing towards The light. We're going to have little Tufts of a brighter green. And I will do that going down. Just more saturated bringing color little warmer. I want a little bit more of the feeling that this is overlapping here. I'm also a little scared of doing any major changes at this point. Almost done. That feels better. Little bright green, maybe more towards blue. Who birth mother right color? Oh. Sometimes it's just funny when you pick really Brown colors. Smack in the face like does not work. Alright so let's get a little tuft of. Grass is or something over here, I'm just going to use a textured brush. Same things over on the right. Just gonna bring some more warm colors. Maybe a little bit more purple. Again, the Purples better than the Red Red Orange. Reducing a little more contrast would be great. It is really high contrast in like more than more than usual for my. Some of my paintings, but I don't know. I don't know if I if it's really possible for me to do it. Without changing like the way the painting reads I can kind of try. I guess OK, so the background. I'm like happy with the contrast. But what I don't like is the rocks like? They seemed to contrast. Just the foreground, but if you look at the reference. You you'll see like what I was. Looking at but that's the part that's bothering me. If I had to say. You're amazing Ohio, thank you. That's very nice of you. Thank you. The trees out a little bit of what I did there. But let's try I have an idea of something that can help with the rocks and we'll see if it works. So I'm going to make a new layer and choose like a textured brush. I think we can. Take some of the shadows here and. Put a little bit of a different introduce a new color that doesn't currently exist on the rock. There's like a? Dark. Muted warm. Brown color. In the reference. In some of the shadows. And I think if I replace the? Some of the dark dark shadows. With this. Then it might appear a little less. We were done with the darks, but What are the values look like so when I look at it in black and white? That's what we get. When you look at the reference that's what you see so. I think I kind of lost the big shapes on the rock. It got too into like these tiny little highlights and shadows. Ann. Lost like the The form a little bit. So maybe I could bring that back in if I get rid of some of the. The little details. Still, trying to figure out what tablet is being used for me. I'm using Wacom Centriq 22 HD. Sorry I thought I answered earlier. But yeah, it's a 22 inch screen tablet. Alright so I'm continuing to darken poop poop poop. Notice you look down while painting, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I am looking at a screen that is correct. A little bit more shadow over. Yeah, and some of the bounce lights probably too, too much. But Hey, That's why we do these you learn something every time. Alright so I will merge everything. And make a new layer. And. We can try to add a little bit more. Atmosphere atmospheric perspective to help separate the. Foreground. So I'm just going to make a selection. To do, I'm not going to. Worry too much about being perfect, but trade. In the rocks selected. Mila says if you lose the big shape like you mentioned with the rock is it possible to fix it or is it better to be happy accident. I think it depends on your goals for the painting are. Like if it's just so study, then you can try to spend some effort fixing it. But you know if it's time study. Then you know you might just say it is what it is like trying to fix it. But in my case, we're doing a 3 hour study so I can't necessarily. You know fix it perfectly. I'll just do a little fix what I can. And then move on. And just understand that you know you learn and get better on the next painting and that's something that you can remember for the future when you do like similar kind of environment. So you learn from that, if it's like a client work or something you should probably try to fix it so that your. Painting looks good that you're giving is a final result. That kind of depends on it's just how much time and effort. You want to work into trying to fix it. It is possible to fix things. But sometimes it can be really tricky when you're working on a foundation of something that is. That is a little off, sometimes it's even easier to start over. With that thing like you can you know maybe? Try repainting that section or redoing it in the future like re trying the study. Sometimes it's hard to fix things it is possible but. Depending on the situation. It can be more or less easy to do like certain things are like really easy to fix. Sometimes they'll be something that you can just use a quick select something photo shop do a quick filter or just alter something and bam. It's fixed, but it kind of depends on the specific scenario. How labor intensive fixing that thing might be. So. Yeah. Alright so put a little bit more of a glow to separate the foreground in the background. Emerge that down, make a new layer put it on, I'm gonna try to darken mode. And see if I can just. Make a more cohesive feeling to the colors in the foreground. You still feel like. The rocks don't feel as much part of the scene as they could. Little bit pasted in but But it might be harsh critique. It's not bad? I'm actually happy with the painting, but I'm nitpicking that because you know. Can be better? Merge those together. Almost done. You try one more thing. Make a selection of the rock again. It would've been easier's on his own layer, but it's fine. Most the time emerging things is makes me makes my process faster so for the few times that it doesn't. And I have to Reselect, something it's OK, but I'm going to make an adjustment layer. So it's under my Camera, but there's little half circle icon down there going to press that and go to. Let's try selective color. I think maybe. Maybe I could mess with. Some of the Some some colors on the rock. Might be able to change some things. I when it comes to this, this kind of adjustment. I am just completely winging it. See Select Reselect. Maybe maybe that wasn't the way to go, maybe like curves or levels could have been better. Yeah, there, we go. So lowering the mid tones. That might help with Lower the idea of lowering the contrast a little bit. So I can. Soften the edges of that mask a little bit. And. Yeah. Maybe be like that better. Yeah, I'm at, I'm at maybe it's better like this. I think I think I. I think it's a little more relaxing. That's a little. Later. And then I can just. Erase out or yeah, mask out a couple. Darker areas again. OK, going to Bridget. Yeah, so I think we're about done sometimes at the end I like to. Make a little shadow. Around the outside just to keep our eye focused towards the center and lower the opacity quite alot 'cause. We don't want it. We don't need to be so crazy. But I think it, fits this kind of lighting scenario to have that. And. Tiny bit more blue here at the end. What's going on with overlay an just boosting up the color in a couple places where I? Wouldn't mind some extra saturation? I don't want to go crazy at the end and totally change the painting. But maybe it like. A little more warmth in the center. And you're facing towards the light. That. Going to smoke out some things around here. I think we're almost done. The last thing I'm going to do is. When final color, Dodge layer. I want it to be. Just to give a little glow to the center of the cloud. And lower the Opacity 'cause, it got pretty intense but. The know how for the step you're doing right now with overlay. Just comes with practice. Yeah, it's just just following your instincts on like there's something feel. Does it feel good does it feel done? Does it feel like it needs a little extra magic to it like I don't always you always have to do. That step, but I felt like it needed a little off. In some places. Add some brighter. Leave here too. And I think it's pretty much done. Sometimes I'll lower the opacity after doing the finishing effects. That's why I like to do it on a separate layer. Sometimes it changes the mood more than I expect so then I'll lower the Opacity and. That the original throughout the show through a little bit more but. Overall, I'm I think I'm happy with this one at the very least. I'm happy with this guy and the water. The foreground didn't come out as nice as I was hoping but. Still, an enjoyable painting and a really epic spot. It was nice to look at this while I was painting throughout this dream. So. Yeah, I think this is it you guys. I think we did it, I know there is a couple of people that were considering painting this one with me. If you did, and you want to share what you did, you're welcome to post it? Um. But. Thanks. Thanks, you guys thanks Michael Power Hornett pot image. Thank you. Yeah, it's there rocks, the rocks were tough, I will look forward to doing some rock studies and maybe doing a better job with that, but thank you. Thank you Mills. Thanks for being here really appreciate you guys being here. Thanks for the company. The suggestions and all the nice comments and everything. Yeah, I enjoyed it and will do more of these. Will do more of these here? I don't know 100% when my next. One is going to be, but it's once a week and I will when I do get hopefully soon. I'm going to be having as particular schedule.", "duration": 6070.110000000016, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url":

But if you guys want to paint the. Image that I'm working on I'm going to share the link. It's actually it should be already available. If you look under the info tab. I believe is above the chat you should be able to get the image. But just in case I want to make extra convenient under the put the link in chat right now, so that should take you through this picture if you want to grab it and give it ago. I'm going to be painting between 3:00 and 4:00 hours on this today, but probably close to 3 hours. My goal is 3 but if it goes over a little bit, then that's OK. We'll see. We'll see what it what we need to do to make it look good, and we're just going to do that, so that's my plan, but is close to furious I can an. I'm going to put this on my other monitor in larger size just like you saw on the screen as usual. Are you sick your voice seems little weaker really? I'm not sick? I hope I don't feel sick? I am a little tired getting back from traveling over the weekend and then having like a lot of things going on instantly so I haven't been getting as much sleep as I would like but, yeah, so maybe that's doing it, but no, I I hope I'm not getting sick. I definitely don't need that. Please No. Wish I could join have an interview thing have to go in a bit might do. It later really like this reference OK awesome. Good luck with your interview and everything. Hi Tesla welcome. Let's put this reference up here using pure ref so it's going to be above are canvas. You can take a look at it no matter what and my canvas size if you're curious is 3000 by 2250 pixels. So that's my canvas size here. OK, so I'm not going to have a timer on the. Screen but will just you know stream starts around 12:30 so. Around my time, 3:30 or 4 that's kind of what we're going to go for for the amount of time on this painting. So. Let's begin I I really love this image when I first saw the references or the images that Andy shared for possible reference. This one jumped out at me right away feels birthday man Tesla is your birthday today. Really? Oh man Happy Birthday is it really your birthday, I. I'm I'm kind of disappointed in myself. I didn't know that already. But I hope you're going to have a wonderful day. And treat yourself. So I'm going to start aph just blocking in the. The shapes big shapes and. Like the main important things going on in this. Seen so I really like the dramatic feeling of that the perspective on this pathway coming towards us. Highly Hey fault images such a nice view. I know right. It's absolutely gorgeous and I hope that I'm going to do it justice. We have a good amount of time to work on this one today, so I'm happy about that I think will. Be able to do something nice, you guys know I like desert in Canyon. Type scenes, I really. I really enjoy the the colours are so beautiful and like the warm oranges and Reds and Browns and then you get like the cool Blues and Purples and it's just fantastic. It's like the best for me and this is from someone who I really generally love, green all green all lush environments but. These desert in King and scenes also are a Top favourites. Turned old today are. Well, I hope you have a great day enjoy it is your day. And yeah, I hope I hope you have a good one. Looking forward to see how you do the canyons definitely something I want to learn to do better me too. I'm going to do my best. An I hope it's helpful right now, I'm just going to start with the usual. Blocking in everything to get a feel for you know where everything needs to go and proportions and stuff like that. But one of my favorite things about this reference is the you get that nice atmospheric perspective of the canyons getting further and further away and getting more and more light and blue ish in color. So beautiful hi. Tanner good morning. Also, for me. I think it's OK to maybe change some of the shapes a little bit. It might be the case that this is like a famous area. I don't know it's be honest, so maybe somebody would look at my painting and know that there's a rock in the wrong place, but to me. It's not so important. I think I'd rather pay attention to. Making the Seen that look interesting so I'm going to be open to may be changing. Some of the Rock Heights and things just. So that it makes the composition better, so for example, over here. This this one. I think is nice and gives a little bit more balanced to the right side of the composition. So I would like to exaggerate that more or at the very least, to make sure that I'm getting it. At least as prominent as is in the reference and if anything. I'd like to make it a little bit bigger just so we get the balance between this big one on the left. And over, there. So. Um. Mill says the reference reminds me of the starting screen with the path in the foreground and mountains in the distance. Yeah, there's a little bit of that feeling I agree. Read says what I think I love most of 'em desert scene is the fact that the shadows are really blue and purple so complimentary with the warm look. Yes, I completely agree with you, yeah, yeah. It's like this guy is very like especially on the sunny days. There's like this blue purple vibrant Sky and you really see that in the shadows and you guys know I love to exaggerate the Blues and Purples in shadows when I paint so. The starting soon screen Oh here faulty if you got here just a couple minutes earlier, you would have seen this so don't worry. You didn't miss too much. But this is just a painting that I did a while back now. That was reminding Mills of the one we're about to do composition Wise. So, like this over a little bit. Hi Christina welcome. So probably have to do a couple layers of. Planning here like for example, want to have overlapping things, I find it easier to lower the Opacity then make a new layer and then for example, we can figure out this Ridge that comes down here and now it's easier for me to see the Ridge because everything else is a little bit later, so sometimes. That's nice. Did you get yourself something ability to see what you're doing? And I really like the strong shapes of the shadows here. That's another nice thing about these kind of scenes is like you can really emphasize the angles like I try to do that. Even with other type of subject matter. But I'm just not that strong with it. Yet the whole stylization of shape language getting more interesting shapes angular shapes. Maybe simplifying them a little bit, but in with the way that has some kind of. So. Gesture an interest. So that's what I'm going for. Thanks. Thank you at the Diggbar Ediola at but anyway, OK just trying to make sure. Pronouncing your name OK, I'm sorry if I messed it up. But welcome and thank you. If anybody if you guys like the reference image and you are interested in also doing a sketch or painting of it, you're welcome to join me and like paint along while while I'm working and you know you're welcome to share what you do as well. If you're interested in doing that no pressure. But the reference images linked in the info section. So it was generously shared by friend Andy so you can paint from it if you like to. Alright so. Think think that's good back here will have some more detail. The only thing that I don't like about this just looking at my own. Shapes the way this is being organized is I really want more variety in the size of the shapes and I feel like? This is working OK, when I start, adding these in I end up with a situation where this shape the size of this shape the size of the shape or even these are all kind of balanced too much too much. It makes it more interesting if we can have some variety there. So I'm going to turn off this layer or maybe I can even just use a? Select them, an change things this way, but maybe if we were to make these a little bit more flat and elongated just have some kind of different shapes going on. Not all the same. Being smells, he does, he does this is this is Andy Wo from in the discord and. Yeah, I I saw his photos and I was like OK, you've done this before I think. Alright so let's try again. Pier. So we don't need the red. I'll try to paint along tries the keyword. Jackson I was actually considering doing the line tool painting for this one. I'm laughing at myself. Now I I decided like we're going to do something a little simpler for that. I really want to do a line to a painting, but I think this is not the reference to try it on. When I say line toll painting if anybody doesn't know what I'm talking about just a type of. Painting technique or workflow where you utilize the line tool instead of the paint brush to create your shapes in your image and it's a little bit well, I say a little bit. For me, it was very tricky, I tried it recently is that when you pay using only the line tool. Yes, I was thinking about trying it and then I quickly decided we're going to wait for us employer reference. I need to have baby steps with I think. Add Jackson meet you stole that idea. Let's see how many sketch turns out, it's just. It's just kind of the idea of it's kind of fun. You know it seems. It seems fun and then you try it and you're like, Oh this is really hard. But it just looks so cool when it's done well. I can share with you guys, many of you probably already know this artist if you've. I've talked about them before a few times, so but I can show you an artist who's really good with this type of thing that I'm talking about his name is Mike Hernandez and he did it recently did a workshop explaining the technique. So I will post a link in the chat to one of his paintings that was done with the techniques so you can see. Um. And you can check out the rest of his account too. But all with the line tool is not incredible. And I think it looks very cool. Also, if you go if you scroll back through his paintings. You know, there's others as well, and the interesting thing is, is kind of hard to tell at first. You would never imagine, but it's kind of hard to tell at first, which ones are done with the line tool like when you're when you're scrolling through his account. Everything looks very cohesive and then suddenly, you think yourself wait a second. Business painted with the line tool? How can you do that and how does it look like the other paintings here somehow look at this? Line tool. I don't know I love it. I love it, but I don't think I don't think I'm ready for it on this one. Read says my first 32 sheets block of paper is empty is it crazy. I feel like an improvement. I'm kind of proud of this, you should be proud of that. That is, you know, I feel the same way anytime that I finished pack of paper or anything like that. It's a big I think that's a big accomplishment being prolific with your art seeking Whippet doing a lot of work definitely definitely can be proud about that. So I I think what I want to do is emphasize more. The zigzag going down here and down and then down again. So in my first sketch. I hadn't really achieve that, so I think this is a little bit better going to bring back the opacity of both of these. Layers. Merge them together. And then for example. If I bring this down a little bit that zigzag is even more. Prominent. Are you allowed to use the lasso tool? Is well when you're doing the line tool thing? Yes, you are I mean? I'm not I I don't know if I know the details enough to say you're allowed to do this, or not to do this. I think in the end. You can decide what you want to do and how much you want to challenge yourself with being like strict with just using the line tool when I watched Mike's demo, he did also make selections. So. What tools you're using for painting right now? I am using just the paintbrush it's on it's the everything is on one layer above the background. I'm using a paintbrush and in order to make changes to my sketch. I've been using the lasso tool right here and then making selections and then moving things around, so I just circle around what I want to move and then I press control T, which is a shortcut for transform and then I can like move around. Things resize them stuff like that. You can also when you have already made your selection. You can just go to edit transform and you can select a whole bunch of different transform tools here, most often. I just use the scale also use warp quite a bit. I prefer using the warp. Overlake liquefy if I have to make a little change like that. Just select it and move it over. OK, so I think the last thing is up here there's another. Distant. Large. Rock what do you call it? Boulder Canyon Plateau I don't know there's a big rock over here. And I'm trying to figure out compositionally how it's best handled maybe I will just not include it. That might actually be for the best do you see how up here in the reference there's like a closer rock and then one back here? I think it is a cleaner nicer look if I don't include it. The one right behind it. It's kind of overlapping and a bit hard to take in what's going on. I guess this line to insert brush tool, yeah, so for the line tool thing if you want to try it. You can go to the shape tool. Where it says like the rectangle ellipse. All this stuff and then you just select a line and then you want to make sure that it's on pixels, not path or shape. So then you're going to be making lines like this, you can pick whatever color you want and. We move this over so I can access menu. You can hover over the weight and drag this back and forth to change the size the pixel wait. So if you want to make it larger there, you go. And you can start blocking him like that. It might be fun to try like beginning the paint, I might use the line tool, a little bit. In this painting just for fun. But I don't want to restrict myself from using other brushes. I think I think that will use whatever brushes they feel inspired to use here. The only thing that I don't like is with the line tool well. One of the things I don't like is that I cannot use my shortcut keys with my left hand on the keyboard to change the size. I like to use shortcut keys to change the brush size. But in the case of wine to have to go up here and do it, which isn't end of the world because at least that's faster than. Come you know, typing in a number you can at least drag the thing around but. Yeah. It's nice to nicer to change the size with a shortcut keys. So I'm playing around with some cloud shapes here. I don't know. Maybe I'm going to Stylize. This a lot because I like the idea of the motion of the clouds and how they're kind of. They look like they're going this way, and then curling up and. Coming around this way they have a lot of movement. It's kind of interesting so maybe we can emphasize that a bit and then there's one that's like a little bit different. You guys are funny. OK, so I turned the I flipped my canvas and I'm noticing how long key my sketch really is like it's at an angle, which isn't necessarily a huge problem because the landscape and it has a lot of angles to it. But maybe it would be nicer to use skew or. You know perspective and Trey Day. Get it to be a little bit more or just rotate it try to get that a little bit more of a flat horizon. Did you do? Mark May be back in time to be amazed at the end of stream. Good luck everyone by half to Warren. Good luck to you and I hope if you come back. Later that you're going to see great painting, I will do my best. Right so I flipped this is what we've got and. Maybe I will. Squish that in a little bit more. I think that's OK. Let's bring go to window knew guide layout 3 columns 3 rows and just have a look at our balance. So it does seem interesting like we roughly have Sky on one third second, third bottom 3rd like it's working out pretty well. I think maybe it would be nice to have. This. Come up a little bit more into that Top third. Something like that. Playing with the composition a little bit. All right. I think I like it. Hi Linnea welcome. How are you thanks for coming over here? It changed your name, yeah that's a difference over here, I'm glad you got it fixed. Alright so right now, I'm getting rid of old layers. I don't need and we have the background. And we have. Background layers just wait and we have the sketch. One last thing I want to do is mess with the foreground. I think I want to make the perspective a little bit more intense with the road coming towards us and then skew it over a little bit more towards the middle. I think I kind of. Toned that down from how it originally looks. In my painting, but I like the movement. So we want that left to right. Feeling. And there's going to be nice Bush here. Had to 'cause I wanted to comment. That maybe you could approach the line tool as a base color plan. Then it wouldn't be the end goal but you might get more comfortable with it. I was thinking about that. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea that my only. I don't know if the concern or something I was playing with my head is like do I want to use the line. Tool also for the background. The Sky 'cause? I think this kind of Sky is so clean that maybe a grading. It would be nice for it. But I completely agree with what you're saying like so Lenny is suggesting to start off with the line tool just like block in everything. Get my base colors and then if I want to. I can keep going with like other brushes and textures and things and. That might be a way to do it. Your previous color blocking style was kind of like this already yeah, just using. Airbrush or selections instead of the line tool, but you have the end result is going to be kind of similar. I really like this rock on the left very cool how it's like breaking apart. Great I think I'm almost done fiddling with the composition. There's a lot going on here and so I do think the composition is important well it's always important right. If you go the line tool. We also use RGB sliders. That's a good question. Yeah, in the demo. We watched the RGB sliders were used. I think I think not. I don't know if I really like that technique for myself. Like I I like. I understand the idea of it, but I don't know if I enjoyed working with that. Oh, OK. Thank you Lenny, a good luck. Good luck with everything. You're working on. Well, one thing is, you know, we always concede the sketch as it is, and try different things. If it doesn't workout. You know, we're doing digital here, so it's no problem we can change approaches. If it doesn't go well. Let's remind myself that sometimes. Being scared try new things, it's literally. With the worse it's going to happen. Make a new layer. Try something else. Alright so I'm gonna save as is I will turn my layer onto multiply mode lower. The Opacity so I can barely see it, but it's still there. And then lock it so I don't accidentally paint on that layer and we can try. Blocking things in with the line tool. I'm not sure if I want to like infuse some kind of. Gradient into the Sky that doesn't exist or in the reference or if I want to. Just kind of go with. A smooth Sky. Wait, why is this? Oh, and I also in a weird image mode. No, I'm in RGB OK, OK, there, we go. Anyway, sorry about that my question is, you know should I just go in with the line tool or should I just use a nice gradient background, then use the line tool for blocking and the other things. You know, and how big can, we get this thing. It seems silly to block in it's kind of like with your paintbrush. I imagine you want to use like the largest brush for as long as you can. So maybe I will choose like a tiny bit more of a bright. Color for the As we get closer and closer to the. Horizon line one thing that's really interesting is this with this method is the line tool is very opaque. It's like there's no blending you have to really pick the right color because otherwise well. You see what's going to happen, you see the edges. As the colors. All right next to each other. I think on the left the blue is that a little bit brighter. There is a little bit of a gradient in the Sky here. They didn't notice at first. Then it goes to a deeper blue. Not so much purple so they had. Something like this. Who it's so tricky to get the right color? Hello Ben, Alright well, I feel. Unsure if that's a good look, but we're just going to carry on. Let's continue so. We're going to move down into a purple color for the distant. Mountains distant Canyon area. And we just have to start somewhere. And then hopefully we can tweak towards a better color choice. Need to lay down before you pass out into rest of stream Maddie. Can I Tesla Happy Birthday? Have a good rest. I think that using this tool is going to have a lot of give me a lot of weird edges and stuff, it seems. We will see how it goes. Using it Rosie alot. And. So I talk about this sometimes when I'm doing. You know my regular painting style where I will try to. Choose the right color and sometimes make a bunch of mistakes first choosing colors that aren't the one I'm looking for and sometimes it can be a nice. Yeah, I just I don't like the edges here. Maybe I should make a selection and then use the line tool within that selection. I would suggest you to use new layer for the background or for every major shape. See guys no. I don't like using layers. But I think you're right. Jackson that's what he did in the demo as well. I think he used a lot of layers and I was thinking myself like. That's a lot of layers. You can fix the edges of smaller lines, OK, So what I'm going to do is make selection. Oh also I just notice that I didn't bring the. The Sky down low enough. So that OK so let's try this again. Background I'm just going to make a selection and we're going to paint with the line tool within that selection, so that I don't lose my mind, and that we can finish painting within 1 stream I hope. Slow process OK, so now. Here we go. That's not blind Hawk. There we go so I think maybe it's easier for me to paint it all, as if it's in shadow first this very distant background area and then go within that shape and start adding. Like highlights and stuff. I think that's going to be easier. So maybe something like this. And then Now that's on its own layer. So I can lock the transparency for that. And do these kind of things. Within their He. Interesting OK, so let's just go on to the next. Let's get rid of all the white and just get all the basic shapes and colors in first and then we will worry about it, it looks good. So the next thing is, we're going to select like the next layer coming closer to us. So, just getting the silhouette. This one. And we can turn that back on now and then this is going to cover it and so it's closer to us. So we're going to get a little bit more of like the real color so it's going to be less atmospheric. Glow. So we're going to get a little bit warmer color. Maybe a little bit more orange gold orange. OK, so there's that is taking a lot of self control pink this away. Let's go to the next one if you continue the line tool into details. You can always go tiny in the edges. But for this purpose. The selections make more sense, yeah, I think so. I think so. That's one of those things where like we could be a stickler about it and you only line tool kind of thing, but I don't see the point. This one is. This is a little bit more efficient to do I think. With the selections specially in like a certain amount of time to work. But this is where I start getting into like what color is that so for example, there's green here but it's very it's not just green you're seeing through some in some places to the ground where it's like the warm color. So I'm just going to stick to original plan, which is use the line tool to just block in the very, very basics and then use whatever brushes. I want on Top of it. I'm going to, I'm going to go along with that is always. I don't know how to do that. More yellow than you think it always is more yeah in this case. We gotta go really, really warm kind of money with it. I keep pressing my shortcut keys to try to change the line weight, but it doesn't. Doesn't work? It's definitely interesting I don't hate it. Some things that I don't hate it but I don't really love it, either. But it's fun to try so many things. So for me, I guess this area here is kind of a problem right now because I want there to be. Clean shapes of those shadows there, so to be separate thing to view. The whiskey going. I won't get into details yet next one what we can still work on this clear I think. And want to bring in some of the warm. Late on the pathway here it's going to get really bright. It comes towards us, yeah, maybe I will just do this all. Do it. So for example. Can make a selection over my sketch the road? I see something related to this image on discord. That's cool Mills, those are very cool. Oh well, I don't know what I'm if I'm allowed to talk about it, he sent it to me privately but I think that's also. So I selected an area and now we can just fill that in with the lighter color and even go a little bit lighter. Leaving. And at the centre or something like that there's some edges that have extra color. I don't know. Let's do the final. Rock up here on the left. Just going trace over my selection. Trace over my sketch, I mean for the selection and then. And here we go. Then we can really assess like what to do after we have all the way covered. Who? Intense. So to me like the value structure is really, really missing here. Hello master are welcome thank you. Well, I don't have a headset right now is that what you mean. But thank you welcome. So right now, I'll show you what layers I have, I have this one by itself. This one this one here here and the sketch on Top. For my normal painting style, I don't really. I don't really like to keep things on separate layers for so long. But I think for this we kind of have to for a little bit longer. I think I'm just going to sort of paint freely at this point, so I'm going to start using the airbrush an move away from line, too lonely. Yeah, I just don't think the clouds will be nice to do with the line tool. I don't know if I like. Yeah, I think I'm just going to like do my thing at this point and see how the line tool base. Maybe maybe helped me make some stronger shapes. I don't know to be honest. It feels like. It helps me make more chaotic and less deliberate shapes, which I don't know if I like considering how think this shapes were pretty good in my sketch and I feel like I wasn't able to accentuate them as much. But. I mean, I'm just being salty about it. Yeah, I'm just going to paint now will see how it goes. There was my little practice of line tool for the day. What might be nice is to use this kind of brush use a flat brush like this. That's kind of similar to the line tool. Maybe that's a good way to integrate the two styles together and have it feel still like something cohesive. So I'm going to make the. Sketch a little bit more visible. And then keep going. Right so. For the background. We'll just go back and I will try to keep my painting sharper than usual, maybe. Like the edges will I will try to keep the edges. A little bit more clean. I could also turn off transfer on this brush? Which will make it even more similar to the line tool painting, but It might be a little bit nicer because I can use my keyboard shortcuts to change the size of the brush and stuff, so be a little faster. Working with this. Painting on the wrong layer wow great start great start. Alright let's make a selection of this and put it on the correct layer. Right there, we go. I'm going to lock the layer transparency an let's work on these shadows. I want a nice purple purple blue in the shadows. Something like this. And we can go a little bit later in the middle. I think there's. Some more. Bounce leighanne glow from the sun here. But this whole area. This pretty. Purple and Glowy. Do you do design product tech packs or just electric illustrations just illustrations? I don't do like graphic design or stuff like that. I don't have experience in in it, but Just illustrations thanks for asking. So I like this angle here. Guys die back down along that zigzag so I want to get that in. Oh, that's the wrong color. And. Maybe a little bit more warm yet there we go. I hope it is going well for you guys if anybody's painting along if you were. Decided to give this one a try. We are going to go. I can't even like control this thing. So even though my brush has a flat. And this is the problem with blender that I have OK, alright, so we're going to work with this guy and you know what? Edge I like to sometimes paint over Top an. I'm just going to let him cut all that stuff. Get a sharp end. So so that means I'm going to ungroup this. To the brush stroke. But then you have to take a couple steps to make that happen. And the pieces. Over here, there's a bit more of a warm color. But I can see needs to be scored. On the rock. And the little rocks and stones and dirt like tumbling down back here so I'm still using the flat brush at. Quite literally, just going to delete them. Because it will be faster for me. 100% Opacity so still kinda tricky right now. With choosing colors. Oh, except the. It's definitely. I can tell that there is that things that are going to be made dad nab it alright, so the way that unfolds are is. Very intense practice for getting the right color. What's funny is I when I do traditional painting? Cutting like throwing out these templates? I also paint pretty opaque, Lee and I don't. It's so inefficient. Necessarily feel the Frustration. It's making this file judicious. That I do when I answer that digitally I don't know why I don't know why that is. OK, so we're going to try this again. Um. Oh Man, I need that thing to come back. But I haven't gotten. Come on. There's two of AM alright. Used to this kind of workflow yet. One last one. This is ridiculous. Alright cool so. We're going to select. All the scores. Turn off the lock transparency, so I can add some extra layers up here. Score OK. This one is not bogging down as much, so that's the good news. I think overall this rock here needs a warmer color. And I'm not selecting the wrong ones. Something a little bit towards purple, but I don't want to change the value. So it's definitely a lot faster. Alright, that was done. So starkly I don't want to make it. Nice. Really really dark or anything. But do you think that it's too bright right now? Right, so I need to move this down. I need to move that down. And I guess it's OK, if our colors get a little bit more fantasy. Come on Bud, just move. Oh my gosh, just freaking move. I know right now they are. So I've spent cool edit taking me the same amount of time. I hope that's OK. Tiffany idea why color picking is harder and digital then when you're mixing colors in traditional. I hate this software. I think there's a couple of a couple of theories on this, I think 1 is that. At making me really want to just change to see if like. Silhouette is better. You have certain number of pigments generally like you. 'cause this is ridiculous. Well let's say you have a set with like 12 or 18 or maybe you just have the primary colors. OK. Or maybe you have like a warm and cool of each primary generally you have something that's like limiting the number of colors available, so there's some kind of like consistency or cohesiveness. All right? My Golly Gee willikers OK, Alright, so let's hide that. Now we get to do this one. Do your colors that comes naturally from that. All right? So even if you don't, it's just like your painting will be more likely to have a color palette. I'm going to select it. I'm gonna I'm group it. That seems to work together because of that. That's been my experience like in digital you have every possible color at your disposal in a quick moment. OK, and now we're about to as soon as it shows up again would be amazing. So you can easily choose colors that don't look good together. My life come on. Alright, cool. Whereas in In traditional I often will paint on a dirty palette so the colours are already there from let's say I mix 1 color that I need and then I want another color. This is slow and painful, and I'm so sorry. So yeah, we're going to have to figure out another way to export these files, because this this is not. Let's say the first color was Brown and then I want another color after that. Not working OK, so if you're just tuning in, what happened is that we created this in blender, so it's really. That's green. I can mix into that. Brown, an kind of turn it more towards a green color and it's going to have a code more cohesive feeling because it's going to include some of that original color in the new color mix so. It's a really cute truck without any wheels or any holes for wheels. It's very extremely basic and then we we exported that as a no BJ file into this thing called unfold are a nun folder translates 3D templates into paper templates which is really really cool. When I'm picking colors in digital it's like also just the opacity of digital in general. So. The problem with it? Is that instead of creating like one path for all of these cuts, if many many many many, many segments of lines. Your portfolio So what do you do mainly master or let's see? Some 3D modeling. Yeah, that makes sense Mills like Oh Gosh. And so my computer. Is hating it like in? I'm so displeased with this painting right now. This isn't even a big file, which is ridiculous. I am almost considering like starting over instead of trying to work. For it to be like this. From here because it's so bad in my opinion like and it's not like it's not just like Oh. Like I'm quite literally stuck. This is horrible work. Like it takes about 5 seconds for it to like. Keep going. And I'm going to add some highlights here. Nice Jackson enjoy and thanks again for sharing your work in progress and painting with me. Hi Michael Yeah, Yeah, it's it's I've been enjoying streaming on Behance also and the still streaming on Twitch, too. But. Yeah, it's very nice. There's a lot of things that I'm enjoying I like that, you know, I often share reference images. With everyone while I'm painting and I think it's really nice that there's actually a place for that specifically here is really cool. So you guys can grab my reference image if you want under the info tab. Want to join in. I have to remember to paint on the right layer right now, it's very tricky. Not used to having separate layers so many separate layers. So. Let's make another one why not? There's a Shadow that comes across here. Having trouble getting stream to work an app to figure it out later. Oh, I'm sorry about that. But yeah, I hope you're able to get it work. Lee getting hopefully you're able to get it work work later. There's something nice about watching the the past videos here. The. If you watch the video later here, you will be able to see the tools that I'm using. As I'm using them because there's a. Plug in for that that I have going right now, so it's kind of cool thing. Lower the opacity of that. Erase out little bit Oh, you know what I just realized something would have been cooled. I didn't even think about is using? See color dynamics on the brush that would be kind of fun. I'm going to use color dynamics. See how it looks. I think it fits this kind of Aesthetic. Maybe I'll switch to my triangle brush a little bit. Well, I think I'm getting to the point where I want to merge stuff. It just annoys me, too much to keep it separate so I will keep the Sky Separate. I'm gonna read everything else. And just keep going. I can't work like this. So I'm going to go over some areas that I already painted and give a little bit more. Like texture and interest with the colour dynamics brush. And can add some. Blue and a little bit different colours up into the. Mountains. This brush is kind of interesting it almost makes it look like there's a filter or something on here. So I wonder I do want at the end. I do want there to be good. Strong shapes in this so I'm hoping that I can choose where I'm going to put those. Shapes and emphasize them. So I feel like we're going to need to put a few brushstrokes that really stand out in here. Make a selection of this rocky area and. There's some nice bounce late coming back onto it. You see like cracks in between. The rocks. Something like that. Let's flip let's put the campus for a little bit. So I can see what I'm doing. Ideas. Yeah, and I think it's a cool effect that that as the is curving over. You get the warm bounce light facing down and the blue. Purple reflect light facing up it's the same. Thing. How can you tell difference between bounce light in the color of the rocks? I don't I don't know. The bounce late is you don't really necessarily tell the difference. You just tell that over here. The Rock looks like this color over here. The Rock looks like that color. There's bounce light affecting the rocks everywhere. So there's almost no situation in this scene that I can tell where you would say like this is what the rock actually looks like maybe right here. Maybe maybe right here, you know is like an area, whereas this is like blue and this is the. But it's kind of just. Looking at paying attention to the Plains, so paying attention to where the rock is facing down or facing up and noticing the light and how it's affecting it. But it can be confusing. I find that natural types of bounce light like stuff that's going on here is a little bit more easy for me to understand 'cause I'm starting to see patterns in it. After doing a lot of landscape painting, but what I found find really confusing is when I've tried to do. Like a fantasy type scene where you have, like really intense, light on something like let's say there's someone with some kind of superpower and there's like a blue glowing effect. It's really strong and then maybe they have like? Purple skin or something you know like those kind of stories are like how. What is that going to look like an you know you just have to kind of? Play with it and you know, there's color theory to it, but the point is when you get into like fantasy scenarios where it's not things that you see all the time and you can kind of rely on well, I painted. This kind of setting before an you know did it and then you know, these kind of scenarios get really confusing for me. It's it's hard. It's hard to predict what the color. The color of something is going to look like when there's so many different factors. So reference is great, but when you are trying to make it up. If you're trying to make like a fantasy scene and you have to think about this dragon going to look like with this kind of lighting on it's like. Very very tricky in his school ISM course. Nathan Fox talks about it a bit. There's there's a section on that and it is helpful, but I think it's also something that just takes an immense amount of practice an like trial and error and just kind of getting a feel for things so I don't think that there's like 1 tutorial. That's going to make it all makes sense when it comes to that. I think there's a lot of trial and error. I like these different colors of greens well Bush is. Some of them are more blue green some are more. Brownish warm green. But I want to start getting some of those in roughly around different areas, the painting. So that we get some kind of. Feeling of foliage and life here. Maybe I can kind of sketch in. Some little areas that are. We see through to the. Ground the rock to the. 3rd whatever it wanted you wanna call it this nice color warm color. That would be nice. It's just I feel like it's getting muddy like I don't want that so maybe I should turn off color dynamics for this detail. Maybe we need to, like just really be confident with the colour choice here. Can even turn off transfer? Alright so this is just. A layer. To prepare for pudding some I want to put some plants and stuff on Top, but I want the green do stand out more against a different color. Environment so I want the warm colored dirt to be showing through and then on Top of an with some tough sofa green. I think maybe that's a little bit better. Alright so. There's a very blueish. Green going on desaturated blue green going on here actually almost these Gray. Yeah, look at that that's amazing, so the whole relative color. Look at that look at how that looks green. It looks green to me anyway. But it's actually completely desaturated so I can go through red even and go. Really really low saturation and it still looks cool grey. Hi Roni, welcome thanks for coming we're painting a? Landscape in I think this is in Utah, but I'm not 100% sure this is a Photo by Andy in the discord who let me use it for study it's beautiful. But yeah, you guys can download the photo if you want an paint with me or just hang out mean joy right faulty. It's so crazy, so I'm looking for a green. A desaturated like blue green and I think honestly using like 100%. Gray is probably a good choice for that, even though it feels crazy. And I will also use color dynamics just for a little. Will extra something? I'm going to pop in some little Tufts of. Plants and things growing. I'm just using a triangle shaped brush this whole time. Maybe eventually I will decide to use a brush with some kind of texture that might be fun. I like to use voyage brushes, sometimes for brushes that have a lot of texture to indicate foliage. But at this point. I think the most important things for me is to get the colors right and the values in the scene. So I can get all of that and I still have time I will focus more on textures. Not before. It is right, yeah, so. Colors are. Colors are weird higher, with a relative. Relative nature. You think you have one color you put an X to another color it looks totally different. I do think this. Is kinda cool this angle of? The dirt and Rocks and sediment like have tumbling down. These mountains. At the bottom. And I initially wasn't going to make that a lot. The large part of the scene. But now I'm kind of going back on that and then, adding it in. Let's get some of these ridges on the Top. So left any warm colors are going to be facing to the left. That's where the light is coming from where the sun is our light source and. We can just keep adding little highlights on the left side. Wherever the rock is sticking out, far enough to catch the light. And that way we can add some more interesting shapes right now, it's just a big block back there, and we don't have to make it super detailed. Specially 'cause, it's in the distance, but just a little bit more. Let's flip canvas and put my painting. Put my reference. Also added some more shadows. I think that helps. And over here, too, there's Ridge that comes around. And we have to do the same thing with the light come back in with the opposite. Clear highlight the tops. Hi Paul, Good morning. How are you? We're painting a Canyon seen today and I started this off with a crazy workflow using just the line tool. I tried to make it work, but I was in struggle city and I decided to abandoned at some point and just. Paint on Top. It was interesting to try. Maybe I'll try it again sometime. With a simpler reference. Yeah, if anybody is watching and you'd like to try my brushes. You can download those if you don't already have them. The reference image an my brushes link are on the tools tab. So you can grab them if you want. Hi Busy, Good to see you how's it going? I think maybe this little triangle of late is distracting. I don't know trying to decide if I want that to be there. Maybe I need to go the opposite way, and really exaggerated more. I just don't want to lose the zigzag. In the composition. Yeah, maybe that's better change it up. Yeah, I'm going to be streaming one. One day week on be hands. Um. Yeah, Wednesdays. Starting a regular schedule, it's going to be. Wednesdays at 12:30 my time, which is the usual time that I start stream. And I'm also still streaming on Twitch. Bacon family here on Wednesday. And we're going to do a little bit more detailed painting like bigger time. Do a little longer. Stream well, not longer stream, but a longer. Time on one painting. And I'm trying to explain my process and everything. There's a little bit of trial and error on this one was because I was trying something new, so if you guys have any questions, you can always ask me. I've been good crazy crazy stuff like so much is happening. But I'm I'm good, I went on a trip last weekend from Friday to Monday and I was in Florence with cow says Wolf and his mom and we had a really good time. Like I've always wanted to go there is my first time there, so it was a huge thing an? Yeah, it's been really busy like. But good good good, I feel very inspired. Wanted to get some feedback as well, an experiment piece, yeah of course, let's see. Oh, this is cool. I like the art nouveau kind of vibe. This is phase is work. Really nice. Yeah, I think. Gas first feedback if you want to critique or anything. It's such a different style than what I do so it's kind of hard. I think it looks really nice think the detailing with the designs around the outside I mean, it really looks. It looks very classic art new both to me, Love Art Nouveau wanted to try it out? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think for. I think for this character, the colors that you chose makes sense. My only suggestion would be if you wanted to in the future. You could try to like pick a like complementary contrast in color for the sum of the design so the character like pop out more, but at the same time. Is make sense to use the green? This is something to think about? I think it's a I think it's a successful experiment busy I hope you had fun with it. I'm noticing some tangents, forming here, so I think I'm going to make this rock a little bit bigger. So it kind of overlaps earlier, yeah that simplifies it a little bit that's better. We can get her zigzag back. This also. Points towards there. Ah. I'm noticing something in the composition that I kind of missed. OK. Going to merge this and just duplicate everything. So this rock here, Brock is huge. Huge structure huge Mountain Canyon I'm not sure what to call this plateau. When did you flip last? Oh, I bet flipping a fair amount. I think I'm not sure exactly how long ago, the last one was but. I think I think I found an issue. This. Rock has a kind of fades down into the. Into that. Zig zag and kinda helps with it. I mean, you could consider this is also a tangent but I don't know I think it works. That's something in the composition that I changed you did after I asked. OK, sorry about that, yeah, I have been flipping a bit, but I somehow didn't see this. I'm going to try to make some adjustments. Without redoing everything will see how that works. Let's see if easy says here are some examples. What do you think I could learn from those? These are so pretty. Ah. Yeah, I think. I think they do have a little bit more of like. There are a little bit less monochrome. But. I think you're I think you're on the right track. Maybe can open years up again. Take a look. I think also these have the head of the character like really smack dab in the center of the circle. And I think that helps I think. I think maybe yours is like sharing attention with this swirl a little bit and her head completely blocked. It then maybe that would be a little easier to read but I think you've done very well with that kind of style. Sorry for the hold up here as I. Revamp my whole composition. Sometimes it happens. Here's my paint along yes. Let's see. Who super cool? This feels like. Plea this feels like like really warm. It's crazy because you're using so much blue and cool colors here, but this feels like a hot day like this sunlight feels intense. That's really cool. It feels very, very bright and very hot out in this painting, it's interesting you're able to capture that. Hey Andy Welcome I'm painting your photo. Thank you so much for letting me use it. It's amazing, I started out. With a different workflow than usual attempting this line tool. Challenge thing and it was kind of rough, I didn't really enjoy it so. I I switched after that back to my normal painting. So. Now I'm Going back over things, yeah, I'm just taking it from here, so the line tool did provide a good starting point. But then I moved on to. My normal painting. Routine. Pretty cool photo, yeah, it is feels like a photo from the 80s. That's funny. Such a nice simple palette to basically 3 colors, plus white. Really? Hum. 3 colors, plus weight I was thinking about that, after the James Gurney video that I shared earlier today. After watching that this morning. I was actually thinking about how he described his color palette and it seemed extremely limited, but his painting doesn't at all look like he's using a limited palette. It's pretty wild how that works I'd like to learn more about that 'cause I tend to like to have. Whatever colors I want even if I don't use all of them. I always start a painting with like a whole bunch of tubes of paint. I my first paint. Selection that I had was the Holbein 18 colors set and so. Then I after that, I decided to just get the complementary and not the complementary sorry the primary colors and sort of mix my own from there. But I still use a lot of other tube sometimes. If I get stuck on something or it's just faster and. I have a hard time deciding how to limit myself in that way. Adding a little bit more purple here. Merge that down so I can compare from a little bit go to now. I'm not sure if it's better or not, but. Where we're going we're continuing on? Here. Try to paint the school last night, but I don't know what I'm doing. Mill says it was a good start. did I did you post it and I missed it, but either way. I'm proud of you, you know it's? When you're starting something it's always going to be. It's going to be tough, at first, and it's going to feel awkward. I mean, even as someone for me? Who did art my whole life. When I first started doing digital just like having a new medium was tough and I felt awkward with it and you know it was. Took awhile to get comfortable with that so. You're doing you doing good. Just starting and just kind of getting through those. Those early ones. Let's see to do today's inktober I don't know if I like it or not OK. Let me see red. I like it, I like this alot, the Cherry Blossoms. I think it's really pretty I like how like These kind of fade away you can see that maybe these are other cherry blossom branches in the background. And then the one that's more. Prominence is done with actual fine liner so you can see it clearly is very relaxing and pretty to look at. Yeah, I really like it, I wonder what you are. Not liking. Yeah, I think it's great. Ah, yeah, read it looks really nice. It's definitely reading well. Definitely. OK, so I think I want to start with some details on here, so for example, the cracks in the rock. Especially this close. This rock that's close to us on the right. I'm going to do this on another layer in case I don't like it but. It's important for us to have these. Sharp and intense shadows, I think. I mean, if you look at the reference they definitely exist there. Maybe I can first sketch them in. But it's like the way that the rock is just kind of breaking up. OK, so I sketched in some now let's go and add a deeper. Deeper crevice in between them. And shading. So I'm just using the racer 2. Erase out anytime by go over the. The rock shape into the other one 'cause I want them to have clean and. I want them to be clean and very different from each other like I want to be easy to see that the the individual shapes. It was probably 10 to 11:00 AM to the contrast is pretty high odd that's cool. That's cool to hear by the way it worked was this exactly or maybe. Not exactly but is this in Utah or something it. Looks like pictures. I've seen from Utah, but I've never been there, so I'm not exactly sure. But it's a really, really pretty. I love the colors. And the shapes and the leading lines. It's a great composition. Canyonlands Utah, West of Moab. Awesome I hope I can see something like this. In the future like to go there. Big hang fam welcome how are you? You're doing at Canyon Painting. And you can grab the reference image if you want to paint along the reference is a Photo by Andrew in the chat who kindly let me use it for painting. So there's a little something that we lose with this. And when we Add all these shadows so I'm going Theresa, a little bit. Try to keep it pretty minimal like just in the cracks. Happy to meet you all well. We're happy to meet you too. Thanks for thanks for coming to the stream. And I will choose a little bit of a darker color for the. Deeper parts of those cracks. Just in that one area it's getting pretty dark. And maybe it could also use like multiply or something that's intense. Something like that. Or normal. Boo. OK busy enjoy the Luke thanks for being here. This might technically not be within Canyonlands, the road depends. In too deep into a Canyon and then follows the Colorado River at some point you leave the park at Camera if it's past that or not OK, OK well. I was even just trying to make sure trying to figure out what state was in so it's OK. If you don't know exactly exactly specifically but thanks for the info. I'm going to merge this down. Straight be brave. And I might soon be getting through a part where I want to use a different brush. I've been using 1 brush for really long time now. An I do like the cohesiveness that gives the painting. But I'm going to be having a little. Bush on the left hand side. And there's also going to be. Some random little foliage and Tufts and things so I think it might be nice to use a brush with some different texture. Just trying to decide when it's time to bring that in. Or if I can maybe get away with just using this brush there's some other techniques. We can use one just painting it, but for speed, it might be nice to maybe use the lasso tool. Make a selection of an area and then we can just paint within that kind of scribble in a texture or something that's kind of cool thing to do. So let's try it. I'm going to make a new layer and for example, over here, there's these little Tufts of grass is so I'm just going to select. Roughly the shape of what I wanted them to be. And then pick a color and then we can do something like this. Where we like scribble in? Like that. And it makes a cute little grassy shape. We can lock the layer. And then pick another color if we want to give a little bit of a gold gradient to it and we can. Like draw inside of that shape or. Choose like an airbrush. And do something like that. That's kind of fun. Yeah, I think I will add a couple like that. And, of course, it's a little awkward with them just coming out of the ground with nothing around them. But I think if we add a few it'll be nice. Let me just keep an eye on what time it is? Alright we're doing pretty good. We have time to add fun details and things. I think I have about. Another hour to an hour and a half to work on this. So I think everything is really. Kind of in place at this point, and we just need to make it look nice. So I think I think we should be able to do that. Are using Adobe photo shop software? Yes, I am? I'm using Adobe photo shop CC 2019? I have the photography subscription so. I have that includes photo shop and Lightroom. Yes, I'm using photo shop right now for painting. Just going to put one of these on it, a little bit an angle. And that's that for those 2. Let's keep going a new one now we can do the same thing with like me zoom in on the reference. There's some other areas like that over here. I think Oh that's just shadow. I thought there was like a purple plant growing. We can select areas. I'm kind of just paint within them. Which is a cool way to make some textures without? Using a texture brush. Your sound is quite low. I haven't heard anyone else mentioned that. Did you turn it up as high as possible on your end guys? Let me know if anyone else? Is having trouble but it's already at the maximum in my streaming software so I'm not sure I can change it. I have 34 layers, Please send help Oh my gosh. Jackson how I can't do it. I can't do it with some kids. I give you a lot of credit for sticking sticking with this one and doing. Trying that crazy line tool stuff, although I really did like the barn painting that you posted. Hollys, like merge them. OK thanks Mills. I think I got up to 22 on my art. Nouveau piece, yeah, I can understand that. That seems like the kind of style that you would want things to be very clean. You have to keep things separate bit. So the shadow that's crossing the. The pathway here. Is meeting up on the other side? With the foliage here, so I should probably put those in shadow also. The layers are pretty necessary in that case like with different circles, yeah exactly. Can imagine? Yeah, I find that depending on the art style. It makes a lot of sense to have different layers. If you want to keep things very clean and. If you have a lot of line work and if you do a shading that's like kind of cell shading and that kind of thing it makes sense to keep a lot of separate layers. We know it drives me crazy. Yeah, this one area is getting very busy right now, I'm not sure if I like. Where that's going? But I'm just going to merge. Will keep going with his pain on Top of it layers? Are too confusing for me to keep track always being on the wrong layer. Yeah, that happened to me today. Like you think at some point that's going to stop happening to you, but it never does like it's always it's always a possibility. There's always the potential to being on the wrong layer. So one day you will paint some rocks on the side of the road here there's little. Little rocks and little stones and things. So I'm wondering if I can kind of scribble them and not if that'll work for example. There's one here that's like pretty big enough to. Bother establishing sheep. But there's also a lot of little ones where you just see like a highlight. And maybe some where you see the shadow. So we can just kind of hint that these little. Details. Skipped all the little rocks, yeah, I don't blame you. I'm not sure if I should too. It seems. It seems like a bit of a distracting detail to consider adding but the road does get really close to us so I guess the point where I'm like well. What do I do down there is it? Is it OK to leave it smooth? I think it's just a choice that. Yeah, I can go one way or the other. Looks like an illustration thank you. We're getting there. I wanted to work in a little bit of this area next to the side of the road because then I'm hoping I can add some lighter, Tufts of green that will come in front and. Have a little bit of A. Will stand out more? So. Yeah, I think that makes it look a little bit rocky. I bought a rake brush makes painting grass employment easier ooh that's a good suggestion. You know, I have a couple of Rick brushes and I always forget about them. I rarely ever use them. There, in my brush set. I have a tendency to do that, like forget about brushes and then like rediscovered them and use them for like. A week and then go through the next brush Oh this one is also cool. And forget about it. The brush I'm using right now used to be my Top favorite brush. I haven't used in a while and now here we are. You too, it's a fun, though. It is. So I think I want to mess with selective color a little bit. I'm going to make actually L duplicate this layer in case I don't like what I do. But I'm going to go to image it just selective color. I know I could also use an adjustment layer, but This is how we're going to do it. And I can hear shift and mess with the different different colors in the image so if we want more red. We can do that. and I actually think more red is a very good option. I think it looks as an ice pop to it can exaggerate the mood a little bit so if we lower the cyan. I don't know if I like more magenta that makes it locally in the day. So we'll go we won't do that. But the yellow is good, too. And then we can make the reads like warmer lighter or darker. I think that's good so we can kind of check the difference. And it didn't do too much. It did saturated more and make it tiny bit more warm. So let's go to selective color again and mess with the yellows. So we can decide do we want them to be more green. I think we do. We can also make them more. Warm so this will get rid of some of the greens that I chose that were very little to green and not. Warm enough that kinda helps with that. And we'll see you know if we like. What we're doing here but it's fun to mess with so next let's do magentas? So I think it's nice to make the Magento's a little bit more. Blue maybe so there's more of a contrast between the warming cools. A little bit later value. Did I cancel that? Selective color. Magentas Here we go. OK. I kinda like it. It can be fun to just go through these and see how. See how the different options look, you can really change the whole move your your painting. In this stage, which is kind of a little worrying sometimes but. We can be overwhelming to have all those the power to change all those things. So that purple got really bright, but I kinda like it. I want to experiment with it a little bit and also let's mess with this guy. Yeah, well will saturate this guy a little bit more. When I started this, I was using the line tool so now. Maybe we can. Just go back and smooth out the Sky a little bit will add some. Clouds. And. Can also Take a look at the levels. The adjustment layers. Change the The contrast a little bit. Well thanks Mills. I'm glad you think so. Really be hands has an iPad app, but you can't watch streams on it is that true. The Gray blue like we can choose a lighter blue also. Let's turn into black and white. Well, I hope you guys are doing well if you're painting along or working on any of your own stuff. I hope it's going well. I definitely had a little bit of a rollercoaster with liking and disliking this painting as we went through, but I think overall I I like it now. Let's try color dynamics on our brush in the Sky. Kinda forgot that I've been using that I think I might want to just merge the clouds now. I will duplicate the Sky layer just in case but I'm going to merge that down because it's nice to be able to color pic from the. Background and just bring it back into the clouds shape. Of course, you can use the eraser for that. But I like the freedom of just being able to color pic with the? Alt. Bring up the shortcut color Picker and just keep painting it's super fast. And maybe it's nice if this guy has some different inconsistencies with it, whereas right now, it's just the Airbrush. Color dynamics on the cloud brush? Yes. That's what I'm using right now, just to test it out. Because I use color dynamics on the other. Parts of the painting I think it might look more cohesive if I keep doing that. Everywhere. Is it per tip? Yes. It is applied pro tip? So that way. There's a striping effect that's happening. It's hard to see on the White 'cause. It's just not very intense. Oh, that's OK Andy I'm glad you could make it to the stream since we're working on your photo but don't don't worry at all. I'm totally. OK, with lurking and appreciate you guys being here. I hope you like the painting. These clouds have a lot of like openings where you see to the blue Sky in them like they become kind of pattern. Just as much brush to dissolve some of the edges. Make them look a soft and fluffy I hope that's the goal. Painting Super Cool feels like him, there again. That's like the best thing to hear I'm so glad. So glad Thank you. Thank you again for letting me use your beautiful photo, I might paint some of the other ones eventually too. But this one was my favorite from the first moment that I looked at them. Being bold with cloud shapes. I'm trying to make up my own clouds, but make them look like the clouds in the picture, but I'm not following them exactly. Driving down a crazy dirt Rd in the middle of nowhere do you have to have well? I knew getting ready and stuff? So I don't have time to text or in the chat, but do you have to like have a ton of gear with you for like safety and stuff 'cause I'm always wondering like if you're in places like this? What if you're going to flat tire or something like you're kind of in the middle of nowhere. I'm sure you have to like have kind of preparations for that. But it sounds like an awesome awesome adventure. In a Canyon with a dog that's the best. That's extra extra special. Satellite Phone. Yeah, I guess. That does help. Yeah, the clouds are. Definitely important in this scene can't forget about them. OK, so now the tops of the canyons need a little bit more bright light on them. So, like back here. Can draw in some? Edges. Have a spare tire and Jack repair kit, but I have an air compressor. So I can delete to prevent punctures. An re inflate at a real road Ah in a couple gallons of water. So exciting. That's awesome. Thank you and a dog. Super important. Alright I like that. Let's work on this edge over here. I'm going to, if you resell a little bit. And food and my entire campsite in close nice, yeah, I guess you can make you camp out wherever you need 20. That sounds so cool. And extra gas. Wow. A fire rod what is that is that like a? Um. Like a flare or something. Creates Sparks start a fire Oh OK cool. Very cool. What time is it? How are you doing? Good good good good. All right. So I think I want to make a selection of the furthest layer back. When it comes to all the. Kenyans and stuff. Just going to make a rough selection and. Add a little bit of I want to play with adding a little bit of atmosphere, little bit more than what's already there. The background still seems very vibrant, which I think is pretty but maybe we need to add a little bit more like that fade. Into the distance. Want to lower the opacity so we need to fade that much. But just a little bit. And I'm not sure if. That would work in between these either. Yeah, I think it helps a little bit as that's going into the distance. So before after before after. ETA for ending let's see it's 3:00 o'clock. I think around 3:30. Three 45 so maybe 30 or 45 more minutes. It just depends on how well I do with the finishing. Things and if I need a little extra time or not. But. Hello Derek Good morning, Hi Mansor. Alright let me open this link from Andy. The link didn't work, Oh it worked for me. For some reason, but yeah, yeah, there's although the pictures you guys could take a look all and Dogo Pictures. Be there from the trip that. And he went on, and the picture where painting right now is in here, but this ones. Also, these are all very paint rible. This is the chosen one. Look at how cool that spiral is. Amazing thank you for sharing. So let's see how we can work on that left hand side. The Bush on the left hand side. Is that if there's any way that I can do it without the? Texture brushes and kinda just try to do it myself, so I'm going to take 100% desaturated Gray, which looks a green going to little darker and I'm just gonna start scribbling things in and playing with that it's on a new layer. The key is we want the. The Bush to be partially in Shadow and partially in highlight and that's what's going to make it look really cool so up here. We're going to be able to make a big change into the light. I'm trying to stay loose with this. But the Bush is a little bit Top happy, maybe erasing back into it can work. Hey Merrick, thank you. This one was quite an adventure started off using the line tool painting technique and I didn't really like it. But I tried to paint on Top of it with more graphic type brushes like I have a triangle brush and a flat brush that I was using for the most part so it kept a little bit of that feeling that the line tool paintings have, but Not quite the same way just a little bit of. Something different something different I'm glad you like it, though. So this Bush has a lot of Crazy Little. Pieces that come out. Just like it's happening crazy hair day or something. And so we can go to the little pieces and now add. Maybe I can move the brush tip shape to do this. That's kind of fun alright let's try shape dynamics. Angle jitter. But they're not a whole at different angles. You just a little bit. When you don't want to draw leaves yourself. Who? We'll see how it looks the idea is just to get like a noisy texture in there. So let's turn on scattering. And then we can do a whole bunch of this. In the middle. Alright so locking that layer. And let's get to Airbrush. Pick a bright color and the idea is this is going to be partially illuminated now that looks crazy, but that's like roughly the idea so. I'm going to make a new layer create clipping mask take that color well, let's go a little warmer with it and. Maybe we do use a texture brush here. Something like that. I really like the gradient. Sometimes it is really fun to do stuff like that because there's all this like preparation and then when you do the overlay color. It's like bam. Super cool. So now we can come back in and add. Individual leaves I'm going to zoom in on the Bush in my reference trying not to zoom into soon both in gets time so now we can add little. Triangles and things. I say I'm just using a triangle brushes to be triangle. And some of the branches can be illuminated too. I don't like those colors. Let's try that again more green more saturated. I like it, I like it. So yeah, maybe I could go back into the. Scattering. Work. Brush tip sheep, Ingle jitter Boo Boo Boo, yeah, we can give some more crazy. Pictures like this. There's an artist that. I met streaming on Twitch, who doesn't stream there anymore, but does really, really cool texture brushes like she creates. Texture brushes in Photoshop for photo shop. I'm going to link to her. I don't know if she's still doing it or if her old brushes are available or name is Sid Wyler. Yeah, photo shop in procreate brushes let's see. And she was a Patris on I'm just going to put it in the chat her brushes are insanely cool and the one that I'm using right now kinda reminds me of like some stuff that she does, but It's all like a lot of foliage and. Some for her and stuff, you can see here, but It's so satisfying to watch like. She's really good at making brushes. You should check that out, if you're interested. You can also use a darker color leaves and bring them back into the Top a little bit. Alright so that was fun, I like the Bush. The Andy will hairbrushes the easiest brush to make Oh yeah, I have a feeling I know where you're going with this one. So we need more shadow below the. Bush starting with 5 minutes to remember the name of this thing I Bush Oh my gosh. Why can I not remember words? When I'm streaming sometimes? Yeah, we need to put shadows behind this so that it looks like it's coming forward from that. Yeah, so darker shadows here. That we've plant seems like it's. It's really in there instead of just pasted on Top. Although I don't know if I like that. Maybe the shadows are too like muddy colored. Let's go to Hue saturation and maybe shifted a little bit. Maybe that's more interesting. Oh yeah, and this, this is kind of cool effect. This Bush that we just painted. Has a shadow also and it has those individual little? Affect of the leaves. And then this shadow is more harsh because its shadow of. The rock. So it's kind of cool. So 1 area that I didn't get to work on very much that I would like to add some more detail before we're through is over here on the right. There's all these little shadows. I guess these little plants and so to the right of them. There's shadows going all the way down here. So let's see how this goes. Click this side of the canvas needs a little love. Some more circular. Tufts. Over here. Becca, a little Matchy Matchy. Don't need them all to be the same shape and size that's not so interesting. Hi Angela Good morning, welcome. We're doing, it some. Landscape painting. And I'm kind of putting the finishing touches on right now. I'm working on this area over here that got a little bit. Neglected. So yeah, we can highlight on the left those little. Tufts I just feel like. It might be too noisy. All these kind of details. I'm adding right now, it's going to bring a lot of.' Extra detail and distraction through this so maybe I'll feed that away a little bit. So it'll just be up there closer to focal point. So it'll just be up there closer to focal point. Where we allow some extra level of detail? Where we allow some extra level of detail? A little bit here. A little bit here. Over the fixture. Over the fixture. I think I'm OK with it. I think I'm OK with it. Like details thank you. Like details thank you. I'm I'm happy with how the details are turning out. I'm I'm happy with how the details are turning out. I want to add some different color. I want to add some different color. Green in the foreground. Green in the foreground. I notice there's some plants. I notice there's some plants. I don't know what they are. I don't know what they are. But they have like a blue green look to them and they're pretty cool. But they have like a blue green look to them and they're pretty cool. We do this on on its own layer. We do this on on its own layer. But I think that would be a nice thing to add their over here on the side. But I think that would be a nice thing to add their over here on the side. And it's pretty blue. And it's pretty blue. I'm going to do them on their own layer, so I can add some shadow easily with maybe like a clipping mask or something. I'm going to do them on their own layer, so I can add some shadow easily with maybe like a clipping mask or something. But. But. They're coming up the whole side here and maybe that's nice to show a little bit of' scale perspective like for example? They're coming up the whole side here and maybe that's nice to show a little bit of' scale perspective like for example? How big they are closer to the corner and then getting further and further away. How big they are closer to the corner and then getting further and further away. You're just going to see these little little Tufts and not the full Hey of them. You're just going to see these little little Tufts and not the full Hey of them. So I will lock that, and add. So I will lock that, and add. Shadow at the bottom. Shadow at the bottom. Find the right color. Find the right color. Yeah, maybe something like that. Yeah, maybe something like that. And underneath. And underneath. They also have a pretty hard shadow where they're coming out of the ground. They also have a pretty hard shadow where they're coming out of the ground. I don't know if I like that. I don't know if I like that. OK. OK. One more color to add to this. One more color to add to this. This gives it a little bit more dimension. This gives it a little bit more dimension. And to do the same thing for these little little. And to do the same thing for these little little. Tufts we can scribble a little bit more in there. Tufts we can scribble a little bit more in there. Yeah, and their switch random. Yeah, and their switch random. Plants you know, even though this is. Plants you know, even though this is. An area that you know it's not super lush you don't think of it that way. An area that you know it's not super lush you don't think of it that way. But there are a lot of little little things growing different textures, different colors. But there are a lot of little little things growing different textures, different colors. Different Heights and That makes it interesting. Different Heights and That makes it interesting. So my only issue right now is I feel like the focal point isn't interesting enough compared to some other areas. So my only issue right now is I feel like the focal point isn't interesting enough compared to some other areas. So I'm going to go in and focus right on this spot right here. So I'm going to go in and focus right on this spot right here. A little bit more. A little bit more. So we can find. So we can find. Place to add some extra sharp highlights. Place to add some extra sharp highlights. Where the lights hitting that will help? Where the lights hitting that will help? Some little rocks, getting hit by the light. Some little rocks, getting hit by the light. Also shadows. Also shadows. And shapes. And shapes. Just add a little bit more. Just add a little bit more. Complication but we don't want to make it busy just for the sake of it being busy so hopefully, I can find some interesting shapes to add. Complication but we don't want to make it busy just for the sake of it being busy so hopefully, I can find some interesting shapes to add. Almost forgot this little guy. Yeah, that's OK, Mills maybe we could skip that one, maybe a little too real. That's funny. Thank you for voicing your thoughts as you paint needed digital art and self taught so you thoughts are teaching me what to look for that's awesome. Angela thank you. Thank you for saying that I'm glad I'm glad it helps I will keep doing that. Again, if you randomly if you have any questions if I do anything that doesn't. Makes sense you're welcome to ask. Thanks for being here. Hello ink famille. Welcome. So for finishing touches. I think I'm getting to that point with this. I'd like to take a look at just the overall colors, see how things are working together to make a new layer and put it on overlay. I think a I'm gonna use the airbrush. I think I would like to get a little bit more purple in the shadows here right past the rock. 'Cause I feel like the shadow closer to us is like really, really blue. Yeah, we can turn that down a little bit so that seems like a more cohesive feeling between the two of them. And now Going to put a layer on multiply and. Make describe a warm color or actually purple will be fine and make a little big net around the outside, maybe for the Sky. I'll just choose blue. Purple yeah, this will drawer I more in towards the center. My tablet is the welcome centriq 22. Lower the opacity so that it's not so intense 'cause we don't really notice. That around the edge, we just wanted to like subconsciously. I just found my map crunch of this place an accident no no way. That is that you're right This is going to be a weird day isn't it. Uh. It is you're right something weird is going on. I want to add a little bit darker leaves over here. 'cause I feel like it's looking. A little bit. Flat. Delivery went to the area to find a map crunch Lincoln first body click done with mine. I think that's a sign that your Your photo is very good because I think it chooses them like select I think it selects based on popularity. OK, so. Add that underneath it will merge that. And basically just the. Layer with the vig net is separate so I'm going to make a new layer. Above everything and just go to image apply image so it's going to create like a flat and version of everything below it and then all it continue to do the finishing touches on that one. Prada quarter mile from the pains in your making let me see going to look at the spot. Wow. This is cool. Ooh this looks like a really difficult one to paint, though. Insane details if you're going to. Get all that texture. Ted is crazy. OK, so next thing. I'm going to make a new layer and use the black paint bucket turn. The layer onto color, Dodge and use the airbrush to put a little bit of glow. Rate in the focal point rate on this rock now color Dodge will definitely add saturation an it will sometimes overexposed after be careful. How much I use maybe I'll lower the opacity an airbrush a little bit. But it just creates such a warm cozy feeling. To seem like this, and really like kind of pumps up the lighting. So within reason, it's nice to add. Oh, I'm sorry Mills. Let me scroll up. Is this too spoopy let's see? It's loading. Ooh that's a really good one. Here's what Mills found. Very like Misty and look at these trees with the roots. All winding around yeah. I think that's a really good reference to make a kind of spooky scene, not too spooky. Just a good amount of spooky. I agree faulty. So I do like the glow I just don't like how. Warm it's making this. It's making the It's making a color supersaturated. Is it already was saturated begin with? But maybe that's not a problem? Let's just keep going and then I'll decide. I think I've done rushed a bit of the start and I shouldn't do it. Let me see Jackson. Oh my gosh, this came out so cool. I love it. Let me move this out of the way. That looks awesome. This technique over here worked out, so well for this Bush. I love the textures. What the heck to me this is like a really great job lines will painting like this is kind of results. I'd be happy to get if I actually stuck with it. It's so interesting that manages to look painterly and so digital at the same time. I think that's awesome. There's a really good sense of depth there. Ah that's cool you keep doing those if you enjoy them at all. If you enjoy them I think you should keep doing them because that's That's really awesome. Going to lower the color Dodge layer just a little bit. We don't need to go overboard. Let's merge that and then you can see the before and after. And This is why I see if a separate layer. Because we can decide to tone down some of that effect if we want. Yeah, I'm I'm really happy with the Jackson. I'm glad you decided to do it. Hey project, thank you. Thank you thank you. I'm going to add a little bit of a green glow so this is just taking the. And layer normal, the The layer mode is on normal and I'm just using the Airbrush and like. Popping in a little bit of a glow. You can use layer blending modes, but honestly this works pretty well. If you just want to show that there's a lot of light bouncing around there and creating this like overall luminescent feeling. And we don't have to make it so intense, but I think it's nice. There's a little more green for us. And. I want to experiment with this pathway and making it doing some changes to it. I'm going to go to the selective color and maybe take away a little bit of the saturation. The of their like Reds. And make it a little bit brighter. Have to head to the office painting looks great super cool to watch. You paint it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'll make sure to post this one and I'll send it to you also. Thank you so much for the photo have a good day. Good luck with this weird Wednesday. Alright so I think that's about it at the end. I also sometimes like to go to filter annada sharpen filter 'cause. It really makes the digital brush strokes a little bit more dramatic. You can see like the before and after it also kind of. Causes some damage to the image in a sense, but I think it's really cool filter sharp and see how it. See the effect that it has. Worship. Yeah. You can also sharpen it just specific areas if you want it to be more sharp so. After reset up my toolbar things are all in weird places now but anyway, you can take the sharpen tool an just come into like the focal area and sharpen that up more if you want and you don't have to sharpen like in this case, the clouds and all that stuff. And I guess I should have done this before sharpening but I wanted to try adding a tiny bit of a glow right here. I like that kind of dusty glow look that happens sometimes in these scenarios. Alright I think that's it. I think I think it's finished. Thank you read Thanks you guys. And other tools you can change style quite a lot. The tools you use change style that's so true? That's so true. Red cells look what I've just received. Who do art supplies? All that looks beautiful. Enjoy enjoy. Thank you joshuah Thanks for being here. Thanks for watching thanks for listening to me complain at the beginning, but we got through that part and I ended up really enjoying this one, so thank you so much. I'm going to post it. On my Instagram if you want to check their later for the finished version. Yeah, I'll post there soon as I can. Your painting looks great and thank you for the inspiration.

Good afternoon good evening whatever time it is for you. Welcome and thanks for being here. I nagat ish high everybody. I hope you're having a good day so far we are going to be doing something a little bit different today. I usually do landscapes but I've had a bunch of requests lately about painting portraits and wondering if we're going to do some portrait studies together since we do a lot of landscapes. Might be nice to mix it up. So I thought we would do that today. Get back in the groove a little bit with painting people so high red. I picked a couple of images and I thought we could do some studies of these and it's been a little while since I've done portraits, so I'm not 100% sure as far as like estimating how long it will take, but I would like to do a couple paintings today so it would be nice to keep. Each one around the two 2 and half hour mark. But it's a little harder for me to estimate, so we'll see how it goes and see if it needs more time. But I was thinking we could do a couple portraits. Hi Stephanie. Hi Steve and Joanna. Hi everyone so this is the first one. If you look in the. The description stream description you can find the link to the photographers post for this image. And. I'm going to put this on my other monitor next to the chat. Next to you guys. And then will start on a fresh clean sheet. I'm using pure ref to have this little thumbnail view up here, 'cause I find it handy. And that you can find a link to pure ref below in the stream description also. Hi Sean, good to see you all if anybody. If you guys like the reference picture that I chose, I think it's a beautiful photo is from Unsplash. If you like it and you want to paint with me, you're welcome to join in. Or you can just hang out and watch whatever you like. High foster thanks. Thank you. How a drill? Excuse me guys, having like a little bit of allergies and stuff today, so it's just going on this time of year. So I apologize, my voice is like little weird. OK, so there's one more thing I wanted to show you before we start painting, and that is there's a. There's another link I added to my stream description just for today. Since we're doing portraits, I find this really helpful in painting portraits. I wanted to share it with you. You guys might be familiar with this already. But this is a photo of John SRO's planes of the head bust statue. This you can find a link below in the stream description. I'll post in the chat also and this is where you can download some photos of this. They're really nice to study from and look at when it comes to painting. Portraits an understanding where the different curves are on the face and stuff like that. Looking forward to it. I avoid painting people. I hope I hope it'll help with something. Stephanie I'm I understand I was funny like I used to be more into painting characters in people and then I got obsessed with landscapes and now it's been awhile. So I have a little bit of that feeling like. It feels a bit rusty, so I'm hoping I can like get back into it and then maybe I'll feel more comfortable jumping around between them. Right now. I'm definitely feeling a little apprehensive about it. Hey Alexandra, well let's get started and I will be explaining my process as we go through here. And if you have any questions let me know as always, but looking at the time I'm planning, I'm going to attempt about two 2 1/2 hours on this portrait and we'll see where we are from there and then we'll kind of assess if we need more time or not, but. I'm going to be sketching first because I find it a bit easier to do. It's not like it's more of a personal preference workflow thing. Some people like to sketch, and some people go right in and just start painting with. Blocking and colors and stuff. So I will put a Gray background here just so we don't have to look at the white. Bright screen so much. But other than that I got my sketch pencil. Let's get, let's get started. So Oh yeah, so I was showing the Plains of the head thing. what I am going to do with that, just in case you're curious, is I'm just going to add that. To my reference page here. Forgot to do that. That was way bigger than needed, but I'm just going to add this over here. So this is going to be. Well, I'm looking at on my other monitor. Hey Jackson, Good morning. I'm trying portrait today but. I'm. I'm looking forward to it. I'm just like, yeah, it's been awhile but. This is a beautiful portrait so. It's giving me some some inspiration. Alright, so I tend to start very almost like cartoony, this is this is true for landscapes. Two like my my early sketches are always very rough and then I have to kind of go over them. So that's what I'm going to do. Here is just just start somewhere we can refine it, specially digital. It's really nice so don't feel too. Worried about your early process being messy? That's always the case. So I'm mostly focused on her face. But it would be nice to get a little bit of upper body in. It's such a tall photo. But I guess I don't need to have all that space above her head in the compass in my my version. We don't really need all that. I think the hair is really well. I think it's really pretty the way that it's like falling around her shoulders and it becomes such a strong shape. So I feel like for someone who's into stylization, this hair shape has a lot of potential. The way that it's like grouping up and forms into a big curl like this. I think that's really cool. Cool shapes going on here. Feel like I need to. Bigger, smaller. I don't have enough room. Hey Claire Z portraits today. I'm excited, it's been too long, so my goal eventually you guys is to combine people and environments. I kind of went from first I was really the people, not really into environment, so it's like. I gotta get them go in at the same time at some point. Try doing some line art. Portrait ended ended up painting over it. Sometimes that's the way to go, like sometimes it's just not flowing like your lines are. Just don't feel like it's flowing that way and gotta shake up the. The Workflow present in different groups. I'm going to flip so portraits more than anything else. I feel like it's helpful to flip. Why is this not working? I'm trying to flip my little mini reference here, but. I must have messed up something with the shortcut. Oh well, I'm not going to flip the little mini reference. I hope you guys don't mind. I'll just keep going, but it's nice to flip your actual drawing, 'cause you'll start to notice things that are off with it when you flip it horizontally. If you get really desperate, you can flip it vertically too, but I don't usually do that. I have done it, but it's it's only in desperate circumstances. Usually flipping it horizontally is enough to. Get me to start visualizing things better. Uh, see, red says this is the last two portraits I did. Let me check this out. Ooh, this is cool. Check this out. I find it really hard to to do these like wild hair colors and make it look like a realistic or natural or something like that. Even though people people have leaves hair colors but doesn't really pretty gradient. Very nice job on the skin and the reflections. So you've been keeping up with you in portraits, red, that's good. That's good. I'm going to get back in the flow today. Hope all right. Well, I like to draw big hair, so it's possible that I made her hair bigger than needed, but. Who doesn't like to draw big hair? Alright, so let's work on the face. Alright, so I'm going to draw some guidelines for the eyes. Hi Elodie. I've no love. And mouth little guides. Now this sketch and all this stuff I'm doing right now. This kind of messy stuff. It's not going to be in the painting, it's just the guide Ann. I will be putting this at a low opacity when I paint same things I do with my landscape sketches and then as soon as possible, like as soon as the paint can painting kind of carry itself. Then I will erase or just like turn turn off the layer visibility or delete the layer you know get rid of it. So this is just kind of like a temporary temporary guide so I don't worry about it making it like very precise. It depends on your art style. Some people have line art in there finished finished artwork. They open lines. So in that case if I was going to do that kind of art style, I would probably go on top of this, like I'd lower the opacity of this layer and go on top of this rough stage and then do like a nicer like trace over this with a nicer line. Not super happy with those, but it's been awhile that I did portraits. That's what I was feeling to read like for today. I was like you know what I did last night. I I I started doing little sketching of that Sailor Moon. Redraw mean things going around. And that got me wanting to do portraits again. Just working on a character for a little bit, and I've had a lot of questions about doing portraits recently, so it's like, hey, why not? Yeah, I I didn't finish it. I don't know if I'm going through. I want to. I rarely take the time to do that kind of stuff. I feel like I've missed out on the last few like fun meme drawing memes that have gone around so but then there's a Sailor Moon one, and I'm like I really can't miss that on that. It's too much a part of my art history, like Sailor Moon is one of the things that got me into drawing in the 1st place as a kid, so I feel like I have to. I can't let that one pass by without even a little sketch, so. Alright, I have the tendency Speaking of Sailor Moon. I have the tendency, probably based on the fact that I used to draw anime characters. Tennessee to make eyes really big in my drawings disproportionately, so sometimes I have to revise that later on. I'm like aware that I do it, but I still managed to do it quite a bit so. Yeah, rub. Hi Andre, thank you. OK so just looking at my sketch, I think it's OK, but I'm missing a bit of her cool jawline. She is a very. She's a very strong bone structure. And. I want to accentuate that more. Yeah Jackson did you really? I'm impressed that you have impressed that. You guessed that one because honestly, I like. I said I've missed out on the last view. I didn't do the what was that again. The one where you did like half of your face, you took a photo and you drew on the other half. I can't remember what it was called, but that was going around. I've missed so many of these recent drawing. Things that went around the community, but this one I'm like no. I've got to do it. Right, everyone loves drawing those sparkly anime eyes for me it was Mila superstar. Yeah, it's something about the eyes, definitely. The eyes definitely. And like the crazy colors and this is fun. Fun overall. OK, well I don't. I'm not in love with the sketch, but you know we're not like I said We're not going to spend too long on the sketch 'cause we're going to figure stuff out in the painting, but this is more just so I have somewhere to start and is hopefully going to make the painting easier. So I'm going to put this on multiply mode and lower the Opacity. To like 1520%. Something like that. Will lock it so I don't accidentally paint on this layer and then we'll get started. Actually, before I before I lock, it was just in the right spot. I can move her over a little bit. There we go. Now we lock it. Usually end up making eyes bigger, just 'cause I prefer it. Yeah me too, and that's that's like what you can do in semi realism art style. You can do these things kind of differently. I just find that sometimes it gets to like an uncanny Valley thing and then I have to fix it. Then I've gone too far. But it depends on the style. You can pull off all kinds of crazy proportions in your work. Depending on how you do it. Yeah, it's fun to experiment with though. So for my portrait, if anybody is like painting along or you're interested in following along with like the tools that I'm using, the brush that I'm planning to use for probably most of this is that this brush here and you can download this brush for free if you want. It's in my free brushes pack that are it's linked right below the reference images in the stream description and this brush is called soft shading and blending and it's in that brush pack and it looks like this. And I really like this brush because it has it's kind of like an airbrush in the softness on one side, but it has one hard side so you can make a nice. Stroke that has a soft and hard edge and I really like it for painting portraits. This is like my go to brush for painting people, so if you're interested to check it out you can. All right, before we go on, I just notice I made her top of her head really big. OK, so. Lately I've been in my landscapes. I've been doing a lot of underpainting, so I wonder if I should do that here too. I don't know. It's interesting 'cause I've been practicing a lot with one particular subject matter landscapes. Now I'm doing portraits and I've learned a lot in the last few months with the landscape studies and I'm wondering how, if any of that is going to crossover and be helpful in portraits or not. So I started with this color from the for the background and the reason I chose it is because I think it will give a nice warm glow to the scene. And if you look at her skin there's this beautiful warm bounce light in a couple areas. I'm not exactly sure what the late. It may be from her skin and hair, but anyway, it's really pretty, so I picked that color for my background. For my underpainting And it's nice to get rid of the white background, because now I can add highlights that are lighter than this color. An shadows that are darker than this color, so it gives you more of the feeling that you're sculpting rather than just drawing and having to shade everything down from the pure white background. So I also want to on a new layer in between the background and the sketch. I think I'm going to start blocking some things in like the color behind her. She's in a room by the window and I wanted the reason I want to pay attention to this as I find it a lot easier to paint. The portrait, or you know, whatever I'm painting with a person or. Whatever is in the scene, if it's a still life, I find it easier to figure out the background first, like not in detail, but at least put something back there that shows what kind of lighting is going on, because that lighting is going to affect everything in the scene. So if you don't have anything going on the background if you're trying to paint a person with like nothing in the background is really hard because it's like what lighting circumstances this person in. Hi David, good to see you. I hope you're having a good day. Yeah, so we don't have to paint a detailed window over here. We can just pop in some colors. There's some Blues. You know it's blurred out anyway. The camera. Views is kind of it focused on her, not the window. Which is better? Alright, but a little something like this kind of abstract background that shows us some kind of the lighting situation. And I might just merge that down. And then make a new layer. So I do this a lot in my painting and it's just. It's just a workflow preference an you guys nobody has to do this, you know you're going to find out what works for you, but I tend to like to paint on a new layer like so. For example, I just made a new layer here. They're going to start painting her hair, so I'll sit here and start doing this. Start painting for awhile, usually a few steps. And it'll it'll sometimes it'll be for like 1520 minutes. You know, just just for awhile until you feel like you've done something that you like and want to. You know you're like OK, I'm sure that that part I want to keep that and then I'll go and merge it down and then I'll make a new layer. So it's like the layer that I'm working on. I still have flexibility of like do I make sure I like this or not? do I want to do anything with it before I make it part of my painting? But then I will eventually like merge it down to the painting so that's just like a little look at how I like to do this. It gives me a feeling of more of a feeling that it's like traditional painting an I'm painting more on one layer even though I'm not really. It gives me that mindset a little bit more rather than what I used to do is like I would keep the person. Separate from the background, and sometimes they keep their hair separate from them, and then I keep their clothes on another layer and that can work. If you want a very clean art style and it can work for anything. But if for me I've been going more for the look of like a traditional painting so it helps me to merge layers more often. It makes it look more paint hand painted it seems. Hello everyone from Estonia to all a good positive de Andre. Thank you so much. By the way, I think it's only it was really beautiful place. I've painted a few photos from places in Estonia. I really, really like the crazy green like amount of trees and plants and everything that is there in the summer. It's so pretty high, Jacqueline. Might learn a skill and thinking tap dancing. Having an OK day I would be off tomorrow. Wait are you serious? What that would be so cool? Why not? Why not? Actually learning some any kind of bad thing would be of probably be good right now. Get a little extra physical activity in. OK, so let's yeah. So right now what I'm trying to do is I have to save mindset. Here I'm trying to have the same mindset here as I often do in my landscapes and that is I don't want to go into detail in any one of these. The areas of the pacing, while other areas, have nothing going on at all yet, so I want to like move around the scene and just kind of start getting something there everywhere. So for example, she's wearing a black or very dark blue. I think black shirt. And. So we can get that blocked in. We got the background blocks in. We've got her blocked in. I'm going to work on her skin next, but I none of these areas look very good per se, but I just want to keep moving around until everything is at least in there and then we can go back and start painting nicely over the different areas. Hi Michael. Been playing around with that type of Workflow, merging it down when I'm happy it's helping me a lot be a lot more loose all clearly that's awesome. I'm very excited about that. I'm happy for you. I like how experimental, how willing to experiment you are being like early on in your learning process. It took me along time to get to that point, so I think that's really good for you. You don't think I could learn to tap dancer today? I hey if you could happen it could happen. If anyone could do it, you could do it. Alright, let's start working on the skin, so she's got a bright light. She's next to the window. Got a bright light hitting her arm. Sounds like a challenge. Emelina OK, So what color I feel like her skin is going to be really hard for me because there's so many different colors going on. Hi Tesla. Good to see you. I'm first going to just start blocking in colors like I just as if we're painting on traditional canvas and I'm just putting blobs of paint on here, like kind of remotely in the right place so that we can move him around later. Tesla says I zoomed into the subject size and I can see something on the other side of the window which is bright and bouncing lay under phase. So there seems to be from the window still direction cool. So if we get very if like enhanced consuming into the eyes. Yeah, I wonder what it is good detective work, Tesla. Yeah, but it's a really pretty bounce light, very. Glowy Alright, so. Let's keep going anyway. I really like this. This kind of brush because I can. I feel like I have a sort of sculpting kind of effect. I mean not, not so much yet, but we will get there. Well, I hope you guys are having a good day so far. For anyone who's just coming in, if you want to join me in painting this, you're welcome to an you can share whatever you do. If you want to no pressure, but you can always share what you do in the chat. If you're painting along and the reference images are just in the stream description below and also on the info tab above the chat, you can find them there too. So let's start darkening some of the facial features, so we have. A little bit of. More of an idea of what we're doing here so we can give her some eyebrows. Just a little bit of light bouncing off the nose here. So the reason I brought up the. Planes of the face earlier is to remind myself to think that way, and so I have to really make sure that I do it. But for example, if you think bigger about what's going on with the head and remember like this whole area here is like one big angle. And then over here. These are like big areas that have the same kind of lighting on them and not to get into too little little small details too fast so. Gotta remember. This stuff. And there's bounced lay on her face, and things like that. So we'll we'll get into a little detail things. But I have to remember not to do it too soon. And that's hard for me. I like details. So I'm staying zoomed out to where we can see her whole whole portrait, basically. And. I am trying to do that because I want it to read as a portrait. I don't want to. Get if I zoom in, I might make a really nice painting of an eye, but when I zoom out it might not fit in. With the rest of the painting either proportioning or proportionally or values wise like it might be just not fit in with the lighting. I notice that a lot when I used to zoom in and paint zoomed in and out of zoom out and I'd be like what? He looked so good when I was zoomed in, which happened, so I like to paint at this distance from my image for awhile and then when I find we need to do polishing stuff, then I'll finally like let myself zoom in. Robert says Hi, Mattie, the scripture in the UK today Oh man. It's it's pretty nice in the Netherlands, but it's definitely getting warmer. It's not a scorcher, but it's it's getting warmer. It's actually pretty nice here, although I'm inside, so the temperature isn't affecting the outside. Temperature is affecting me too much right now, but I'm hoping to go out later and take a take a nice walk. Maybe take some photos for painting if there's good son. But yeah, thanks for hanging out here. No time to paint, sorry. Been challenged the tab damn. But So I'm painting in her lips just basically as one big blob will get into the details of it later, but. Gotta start somewhere and let's get her eyes. Oh, you know what, let's do. With a lighter color 1st and then. So what I like to do with portraits that I don't do with landscapes sometimes is instead of getting rid of the. Start getting rid of the sketch by removing it from the painting. What I'll do is Alternatively just merge it into the painting and paint on top of it so it kind of disappears that way. So that is something we could do. 'cause sometimes you can. Sometimes you're you need those little lines in the. In the sketch still, if I turn off the sketch. Yeah, we still need it. All right, so the chin is a very interesting and the nose. Last night was am bearable hot couldn't sleep, no. Oh Man, I had that a few times last summer. Actually quite a bit last somewhere. But it hasn't gotten quite that hot here yet. I'm actually looking. I'm actually like happy that it's getting warmer. We've only recently just started having nicer weather. At least to my tastes, to my standards I can. I enjoy pretty warm weather, I think. Alright, so I'm just flipping it horizontally to try to see some of my state mistakes and I definitely am seeing some what I'm going to do is duplicate my sketch layer just like and have this for reference. Maybe I'll need to bring it back in, but I want to merge my sketch onto the painting. So what I'm going to do is erase out any Wiley lines that are like not helpful. And leave the ones that I'm still using as a guide somehow. Like mostly it's the face so. Mostly it's the lines having to do with the face that are still useful. And I'll just merge that down. So. The nice thing about this is now if I want to edit something related to the face, I can. Have the whatever I do affect all of the line art, and I mean not line art, but the sketch and my painting when they were on separate layers, I couldn't use the transform tools and the same way and just kind of pull things around like this. So yeah. Here we are. Portrait painting can be a little bit rough because you know the early stages are going to be. Not so nice and you just gotta power through. Gotta power through the ugly phase as we call it. Until things start looking better. Take a look at the nose. Little light on one side, little shadow on the other side. Start having more 3D. I'm here. I also I do like to use. Layer blending modes. When painting portraits, I find them really handy and fast to use. So. I'm sure some examples mostly like multiply for shading is handy. Fix what I did here would be flipped. So yeah, we start with kind of a blob and then I'm trying to have the idea that I'm sculpting her. From that to make things more specific. I also like to use this much brush when I'm painting portraits to blur out if there's any hard edges that you feel like you don't really want or you want to last edge or something using this much brush there can be helpful. So let's make a new layer, put it on, multiply will grab the Airbrush. And I'm going to add some darker shadows, start getting some more crispness and hard edges. So I'm making a selection of the lasso tool and I'm going to grab a pretty dark color here. And just fill that in like the lasso tool is a stencil just blocking off where I don't want or where I do want the pain to go. So over here we could do the same thing. You can make a selection on the side of her face. So I'm trying to get that. Strong bone structure to stand out more. And then anywhere you want to soften that hard edge, you can just use the blurred smudge tool and where that out a little bit. So it's a nice modules are very nice way to accompany the lasso tool. An airbrush She want to soften those effects. And under the. The chin. So you can hold shift to add to your selection. An all to subtract from it. If you make a selection and you want to alter that bit. So I like the idea of using this warm colors underpainting, but I feel like I've never been able to get it back to a. Cool enough place. You still really really warm. I don't know if that's a bad thing. But just noticing it. So I merge that down 'cause I felt like it was kind of a checkpoint. I liked that layer that I did, so I'm going to make a new layer on multiply and keep going. Not done with that step. And I want to do some shading on her face while those intense. So that a little more chill. So. Just apply the eyes. She is wearing makeup and like a Smokey eye look. So that combined with the lighting. Definitely getting Smokey. Bye. Oh, thank you Elodie. So anyway that you want to block off, like for example we don't want shadow on her nose here, so you can just block that off and then use the airbrush you know. And you don't have to worry about it touching the area that you don't want that kind of thing. You can also hide the selection if you find that it's confusing. Once you made the selection, those little dots, you can control H and then that will disappear. I kind of got used to it. I mean, I don't really mind it, but you can hide it if it's really annoying. Like for example if I press CTRL age, it's still there. I can still do this, it is easier to see what you're doing. OK, so once if I have another tip I have for painting portraits is the turn your painting into black-and-white. Every so often an if you're painting from a reference, turn your reference into black-and-white too, because that's going to help you see where things need improvement, where your values, the darks and lights need help. So if I'm going to compare, you'll see that. As usual, my painting is starting off less contrast. I do tend to like build up contrast as I go, and that's really clear here. I need to add more highlights and more darks so. Yeah, but it's good to check up on that, especially if you're feeling like in areas sort of tripping you up a bit. So I need more shadows on the left side of her face. Yeah. And to turn your painting in a black and white, you can set that up as a shortcut and I'll show that really quick. So you guys might know this already, but just in case it's new to you is really handy. So I'm just going to show it. So you only have to set this up once and then it will always be there for you and you can go to view. Proof set up. Custom. And then when this pop up appears, you can just under the device to simulate under proof conditions, just select working grade game 20% from the drop down. And press OK and then after you do that, anytime you press CTRL Y, it's going to turn your painting into black and white and it's very nice because you can actually paint in this. Like Situation, I don't know. You can paint in linear when you have this setting activated so you can color pic and paint and whenever you turn it back to color you whatever called real colors the painting has. That's the colors that you're going to be painting with even though you're looking at it in black and white. So if you ever like really stuck on something in a painting, you can do that. I've done it an yeah just paint for awhile in the black and white view. I find this so helpful that I usually don't do. Black and white to color painting. A lot of people, a lot of artists use that Workflow, and there's something wrong with it. There's nothing wrong with it, but. Is actually used by a lot of professionals, but for me I like painting in color and I feel like the turning it being able to turn it into black-and-white like solves a lot of the problems for me that I would otherwise need to use a black and white to color workflow for. So I feel like I can paint in color. I just need to turn it into black-and-white every so often. Portrait 2 hours earrings, powers. That's no joke like those earrings are intense. I might like leave them out or just simplify them. Maybe will give her a little bit of a different style hearing like holy cow. Those earrings are crazy. They look cool though. She's definitely rocking them. Stephanie says in just in case you can open the same window twice in photo shop and play some side-by-side. Having the color proofing in one so you see in real time that is super cool. That's a good tip. So Stephanie, if anybody wants to do what Stephane is saying. Let's see where is that again? See if I can find it if you. I'm trying to remember 'cause I had to be honest, I never. I rarely do this. It's on one of these these to open a new version of your. Here file. Is it window? Yeah, yeah yeah, it's under window OK. There we go yeah window. Arrange a new window for whatever The thing is. And then you can have it open twice and I forgot where it was. So usually I use the Navigator window to have a separate thing open. So that's what I do for that. But you can't do the black and white thing like Stephanie was saying with the Navigator window, so that's a cool thing you could have this open. And I could be painting over here and looking. I've actually never tried it like I've never. Never done this. Play Makaveli. Good to see you. Thank you Stephanie. Yeah, you were right. I because of the delay in the stream. Um? I wasn't able to get your suggestion in real time unfortunately, but thanks guys. I found that eventually. Thanks David. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I wonder if I should. Well, I guess it doesn't hurt anything to have it open. I'm not using this space over here anyway at the moment, so I'll leave it open for a little bit. Thanks, Foster and thanks, Chad. Thank you for the tips, I appreciate it. I've actually learned a lot of handy photo shop. Things from from you guys in your suggestions. Lots of little things that are. Helpful. Like the the control Y, that's something that. Someone shared with me. Well, back what I was doing before is I was making a new window, filling it with black paint bucket and then putting it on color mode, which you can do that will also. Work the same basically, but then you can't color pic and paint and it's also just nice to have that as a shortcut you can press with one. Quick stroke at one quick keystroke. Hey Mancia How are you? I'm going to add to her now. It's kind of funny to see like a second painting going at the same time. So she's got a bright light on the ends and there a little bit later so we can happen. Nice little gradient. I'm going to let the painting be pretty loose around the edges. Not so concerned with the just, I'm just mainly my concern is painting the face and then it can kind of fade out. Outside of the that focal area, if you want to get this bright light on the shoulder though, I think that's important in explaining the lighting situation here. You can bring a little bit of that color upon through the skin. Here. Is the nose needs a little bit of love? We actually did knows studies recently in the art club, so if anybody doesn't know, art club is like an ongoing study group on in my discord server and were studying different topics every couple weeks. And lately we have been doing some studies on different facial features and features on the head ringing ears right now. And. We recently did noses so I have no excuse to cop out on this nose. Oh nice, well I'm glad you're here today then Mencia. It's true that I don't paint people down much anymore but I'm hoping to get back in the groove a little bit. I mean landscapes are my main interests and my main subject, but I do like painting people to an eye for myself. I do think it's important to, like not get to recipe on that. I want to be able to do it so every once in awhile we gotta do some practice. I'm painting people. So like hitting the top of the lip here, I feel like there's just not as much a room in my painting. As in her actual face, there's not as much room between the nodes in the lips. I kind of scrunched up a little too much. Sadly. But we can change it. Luckily 'cause This is photo shop, we can just move something around no problem. So what should we do? Can move the eyes up a little bit. I like to try to find these things in the early earlier stages because you can paint over once you make these adjustments and any little rough edges or selection, residual little selection lines and things can be painted over, you don't really notice it so much by the end. I find it a little bit more. You could be a little bit more careful when you're making those changes. At the end. You know you can still do them at anytime. Of course. But they need to be a little more clean about it. Can you tell a how are you? I hope you're having a good day. So now I can make her lips a little bit more of the right size. Through her in the portrait. And we can. Her lips are parted a little bit too. So we can show just the tiniest hint of teeth in there. So all I'm going to do is put like a Gray shadow because all all we're doing is we're peaking in and we're seeing that she has teeth. But we're not really going to be getting very detailed with them, 'cause it never looks. It never works out when you draw individual piece in portraits. Unless you're going for a hyper hyper realism and everything in the picture is highly detailed, then maybe, but for the most part it's best to just kind of hint that teeth. We paid the earrings later or we skip them. Sorry if you told it. Oh, I will probably if I do add those earrings, I'll probably be simplifying them a lot. We could throw something in there. Let's let's do it. So her ears over here, mostly in shadow. And. Like if I'm going to paint these earrings with, especially with the amount of time that we have, 'cause I'm looking to try to spend about two 2 1/2 hours on this portrait, I think that's a bit optimistic, but I'm going to try. And so I can't spend too long on the earrings, but I do think that there. We can, we can kind of block something in. So there's a bunch of little details with light hitting. My internets been pretty bad these days. What about you? Oh, I'm sorry about that. That's super annoying. When Internet we have Internet problems, especially when. Internet is so much of the way we can communicate right now, and the way things are. So I'm sorry, gnutella. I flipped the image for a couple of reasons. The main reason is because it gives me a fresh look at what I'm doing. Usually when I flip the image it helps me see mistakes like I'll notice old I looks too low or something like that. And when you're looking at the same picture for awhile, it's like you stop being able to see the mistakes anymore. You know, it's weird, but when you flip it, it kind of tricks your brain into like reprocessing the image. And sometimes you can see things that you may have overlooked before. So I flipped the reference. I flipped the canvas a lot, but I do it even more when I'm painting portraits. Then, rather than landscapes and stuff like that, I still slip in both but. Portraits even more because that's when you really want to know if you've got something in the wrong place, or like a little bit. Cricket or something like that? Kind of like how. You know it's nice to stop and take a fresh look at it later, but when you can't do that, or when you're trying to just go through the process. Flipping it can kind of help give you that. Fresh look. To some extent, you know it doesn't. Doesn't fix everything, but it helps. I missed the ability to do that when I do traditional painting. I really do. You can take your painting and go hold it in front of a mirror or something like that. Or take a pic photo of it with your phone, but it's not as convenient. It definitely miss being able to just. Do a quick flip. So her hair on this side is covering quite a bit. We don't see any of the actual ear. Sucks because I had some homework to turn it in. I had to call a team to come and fix it. I'm sorry, I'm glad it's fixed. It seems like at least you're able to be here now. Hey Kevin, Why did 2 windows open? Yeah yeah, it's no problem. You're welcome to ask any questions, it's just too and you know what I honestly haven't been looking at it that much, so probably should remember to do that, but. It's to give me a look at my values because sometimes when you're trying to when you're painting in color, it becomes hard to know if your shading is going well, you know. For some reason it can. You can feel like. Everything is working and then turn it into a black and white and check on things and you realize that something is way darker than it should be. Sometimes when we're painting in color, our perception of Hugh can distort our perception of value, which is the shading. So it just helps check to see if our shading is doing good. Oh wow, Steven. Jeez. Ha ha ha. And I suspect. But a shame we don't get the draw the ears. I know right? Too bad we could have gotten some good practice there, but it's just too bad. If all good now nice, well that's a relief. OK, so these earrings are really wonky. The way I drew them. Let's try to make them the same height. Try again. Right, so we've got. The middle part with a bunch of little details and things, and then the little feathers hanging down. And then her hair covers the rest of the rings. Yep, flip alright, we're doing OK. So the nice thing is we don't really have to get very detailed with those earrings. Alittle bit is going to go along way and I do want to put in the little turquoise bits at least like a couple of them. Anyway, for those of you who came in, if you want to grab the brush that I'm using, it's in the free brushes pack that's below the stream in the description. This one is called soft shading and blending, and it's my favorite brush for painting. When I do portrait painting. I really like the softness, but also the way you can kind of sculpt with it because it has one hard edge and one soft edge. I was talking about the beginning but I know a few people just came in so. Is that values, yes? So values of kinda just a fancy word for shading or like the darks and lights the relationship between the darks and lights. But I do think I'm going to close this now. Um? Well, just have the colour version open, but I'll still turn it into black-and-white now and then. Open my zoom in a little bit. Alright, want to work on the eyes a little bit. Maybe that will improve the likeness. I don't quite have the likeness on this one, although it be totally honest. I'm not. I'm not really. I'm more concerned with making a decent portrait that has good proportions. I'm not too obsessed with getting the likeness right though. That's something I want to work towards is getting better with lightness likenesses. I can usually get there at some point, but it takes me awhile. Not necessarily able to get a likeness real quick. When I paid, you know, it takes a lot of back and forth figuring out like what's going on with this person's individual features and like what have I done different? But You might be able to get it as we keep working. Highly, how are you? Welcome. So she has the. Sort of. Smokey eye look. She has light eyes. It looks like even though the lighting on her, that area for faces. There's a lot of shadow, but I do think she's lay eyes. The. See the dark pupil. Now at some point I do have to switch brushes and when I get into super detail stuff because this brush, it only gets so detailed like it's really hard to do detailed things with it. But it also. The forces me from from getting too too zoomed in into detailed so it's really nice. I tried to use this brush for as long as I can. And then finally switch. How do you open up to the same projects at once? Oh, let me show you OK, OK, So what you do is you go to. Chat helping with this earlier. OK, you go to window arrange. Then go all the way down here and then you can make a new window for whatever the file is, it's Open. OK, so once you have a new window open you have to use the shortcut to turn this into black and white, so that's a separate thing, which I'll also show you and you don't have to do this in a new window. You can also do this in your regular window, but if you go to view proof, setup custom. Then you want to select under the proof conditions for the device to simulate select working grade gained 20% and click OK. So then after you do that, every time you press CTRL Y it'll turn your painting into black and white. So you can have this one open. Just leave it there. And leave this one. Now. Regular in color, but you can. You can turn it into. You can do control why at anytime with the regular window open, so that's usually what I do. I don't usually have a separate window open, but I do think it was pretty pretty cool. I might do it again in the future. Well, probably do is just have a smaller thumbnail open. Thank you for typing that out in chat. Stephanie. Appreciate it 'cause it's hard to follow in the video when it's going fast. Oh well, thank you Steve and it makes me feel really good to know that it's helping and that. Yeah, that because they're learning stuff. I really appreciate it. Alright, so I'm giving a little bit of shadow. Two groups didn't mean to zoom in their little bit of shadow to the hair, especially the side that's away from the light. And just try to block in the hair. This this area on the left is a little bit of a puzzle. The values, so this would be a good time to turn into black and white and turn my reference into black and white and see what's going on here. So This is why this area is tricky. Her hair is almost the same value as the background. It's a little bit darker, but it's really close and in my painting it's lighter so you can see that should be much darker. If we want to follow the reference, you know we can do our own thing, but you know, if we're doing studies, then we want to learn and we want to see what we're doing wrong. Yeah, so that's darker things looking better. And. Where the hairs like. Touching her body, there's a little shadow. I like those shadow are at the little Patch of highlight. On her shirt. It's kind of interesting color. It's like A. Gray, but it has a little bit of blue in it. But maybe that's late. Blue bite. Don't think I quite don't think wait got the right color yet. Let's keep going. We're going to figure this out. And I might have to use the layer blending mode, sometimes bringing overlay or something like that. To add some colors, I'm having trouble just getting it right. But This is why I like keeping things more on the same layer when I'm painting. In a painterly fashion is because here I can just color pic from the skin. So hold alt color pic and then just paint over the shirt. You know if I want to extend the skin or vice versa if I want to share it to be over here might seem like such an obvious thing, but I used to keep some of these elements on different layers and I have to go to a separate layer. Any race out of that layer. It have to erase data clothing layer if I wanted to change something like that and then go back to painting the skin underneath and sometimes go back and forth multiple times doing those kind of adjustments. It just feels so much more free and faster. Just being able to paint on whatever layer I want. So that's kind of an example of an area where I felt. I feel like it's really nice to not have to worry about that. So there are some little like strappy details going across through shirt. I'm going to add those later after I would do more shading on the skin. Could be. A lot easier to do in that order. Let's go back to the face for a bit so I know I'm looking at them all over the place, but that's how I'd like to work. I don't like to spend any like too much time on any one area. Because then that area will end up getting very. You know it would get more polished and then the rest of the painting kind of falls behind. I tried to move around evenly so that. When it's finished. Everything is kind of getting finished at around the same time. Could you put a little bit of a highlight on this side of her lips? I don't think that's the right color though. Hum. Color is that. I'm trying not to color pic from the reference, just for practice. You can absolutely color pic from the reference, though it's up to you what you want to do with that, I don't. And I think it's a. Problem package depends on what you're trying to work on. If you're working on studying anatomy. And it makes it easier to just think about one thing at a time with your study, then you know. Don't worry about that. Yes, it is a plug-in Kevin. You rate so cooler is you can find a link below the stream in the description for Coulouris its third party plugin. However, if you have Photoshop CC 2019 or any more recent versions then you do have a triangle color wheel available. So if you go to window color. In previous versions, before 2019, the default was the Hue Cuban that still available here, but now you can go to the drop down and also select color wheel. So if you're particularly interested in the triangle color wheel then you can get it without getting any extra plugins. Um colors does have other features that are cool. There's like gamut masks and things. I like the way they display the foreground colors look nice and big butt. If you're only looking for the triangle color wheel, you can find it in Photoshop now, which is really awesome. I was happy about that. Almost tried to flip the stream as if it was my facing that's so funny. It's funny when your brain gets in that mode. You must be doing a lot of fainting, Machiavelli. Your brain is in Photoshop Mode. Yeah, I'm going to color pic from the photo and see what color is that balance lay on her lip. There we go. Not. I was a bit. Too late when I chose earlier. All right, so we can try some. Details need eyes like the eye lids and eyelashes. Eyelashes orders a tricky one. I kind of like to allude to them like putting groups. Or just the shaded area? Handsome. How do you tell him the painting is going to be? Is there shortcut to rotate your brush so there's some options? Let me choose a brush that can make it more obvious. So this brush here you see what it looks like. You can put the brush under shape dynamics. You can put the angle jitter onto direction. Now I will have to shift this brush tips so that it. Is gorgeous is going at the flat direction of the wide one rather than the. It's inside, but basically now. Depending on the direction that I draw in, it's going to go in that direction. So what I mean? Oops, I didn't realize I was painting on the same layer. So I'm I'm not sure if that's what you meant, but yeah, you want to make sure under the brush settings, so whatever brush you have. You can. You can, uh. Turn your angle jitter onto direction on. The other thing that you can do, and I actually do this alot is you can just manually do it, so sometimes I'll just go here to the underbrush tip shape and turn the tip there because sometimes I like to have like a horizontal or vertical stroke like that. There might be moments where I have a snack while I painted. Almost bite to brush. Alright, so I'm going to switch to a brush with a harder. And this is this brush is also in that free brush back below my stream and description if you want to download it. But this brush has looks kind of like a paint stroke but kind of like a chunky one. It still has a good amount of. Sharpness to it. So compared to the brush I was just using which is more soft. This is when I switched to. When I'm trying to Polish up the painting a little bit more an I want more hard edges, but I will use the smudge brush to smudge out where I want things to be softer sometimes will make a paint stroke, annual want, one edge to be hard, and the other edge to kind of fade away. And that's when it's nice to use smudge. You can't fade away the edge that you want to. So we could give her some little eyelashes like that. I don't know how I feel about it. I always have trouble with this painting makeup. And having it look natural, I think this is working. But you know what I mean? Sometimes I find painting people with makeup on to be more tricky than natural. So the eyelids underneath the eyelid there's a little bit of light catching so. Paint that in. That might be too bright. Let's let's undo. So I think the one on the right side is fine, but on the left we want it to be, not as. Not as brave, it's not quite as close to the light source. Also, I'm sorry about whatever that noises outside. There's like some lawn work, suddenly it, so it sounds like. Hopefully that won't be too loud for you. So here we can share open up a little. Corner of the mouth here. Give her a little purse lipped kind of. She got a little smirk kind of smile. I like it. Did you do a sketch for this one or did you go straight into painting? I did a sketch and I still have it so I can show you. Uh, well, that's really hard to see. Let me Papa, background. This was the sketch so. I figured out proportions wise but we didn't get very detailed with it. But yeah, I think it helped. Oops. Although the proportions weren't quite right on that, I did have to use transform a few times on the some of the features earlier on, so I wouldn't say. You know it was a starting point, but I did end up having to change things from it. Rendering lipstick is the worst. I think it went a little bit too dark with. The details on the lips, so I just cut them onto a new layer and I'm going to lower the Opacity. No, merge those down. So I want to zoom out 'cause it's been awhile that I've been zoomed in. And we need to make sure we can see the whole image and see how it's working. I'm actually kind of happy with this one. I'm enjoying it. I mean, it doesn't look exactly like her, but I like some things about how it's going in the. Overall feeling, so that's nice. Let's keep going with it. We've got time. So I want to. He had to 116. We've been painting this for about an hour and 15 minutes. So I was going to spend two 2 1/2 hours on this. So we have more time to Polish things up and work on areas that need work and stuff, so it's good. I'd like to do a little bit more of the hair too. So maybe let's do that first. The hair is. Maybe the. The area that's gotten the least attention. So we'll go with a brighter color up here. Also, I'm back to my softer brush because the hair isn't quite ready for that hard brush yet, and I don't know if we'll ever move to the harder brush for the hair since we don't want it to be as. Eye catching as the face. Who might stick with the softest softer brush for the hair the whole time? But we'll see. So we've got these little strands curling around here. There's a little bit of like a purple kind of bounce light on the hair. Moldova shined All thank you read, still recognizable. I'll take it. Thank you. Great time to flip. Take a look from this angle. Sometimes I slip not just to get a fresh look, but also because it's easier to make certain angled paint strokes from one side to the other, and this might vary. Depend on if you're right or left-handed, but sometimes it's easier to do something when you flip the image or rotate. You know a lot of people move the image like this. I kind of got out of the habit of doing that a while back because I was recording some process videos and I found that once you. Speed up a video where you've done a lot of that. It's kind of hard to watch like it will give you a headache. If you have motion sickness, it's not going to be a good time, so I stopped doing. I got out of the habit of I know I flip a lot and that can also be a little bit rough, but it's not quite as bad as like rotating all around and. Also, zooming in and out a ton, I used to zoom way in for detailed stuff. Anyway, those little things became an issue if you speed your painting up the recording. If you speed it up quite a lot to a very short video, then it's like it's pretty rough. So anyway, I stopped rotating my canvas like that and I got out of the habit of it and now I just never do it and everything to do it even though this is a live stream and it wouldn't be a problem. I'm not trying to make a video, it's. It's still just like I don't think to do it anymore. So I like these really warm like almost a reddish orange Brown colors over here where the lights hitting and got that. Warm glow reflecting off the Heron, maybe through the hair or some kind of subsurface scattering going on. So turning the layer on and off. So you see the difference even though it's getting more rendered more clean. Sometimes there's things that I like about the very rough version, like I do think it's improving, but you know what I mean? Sometimes it's nice to see that. Almost like dissolving effect of the areas that are unfinished. I think it's hard to find a balance with that, but I'm trying to work on it 'cause I really think it's cool. I like when I see portraits rendered that are like that, like the faces, nice, nicely rendered, and then it kind of dissolves out. So I'm trying to find my level of. I don't know how loose to be with that kind of stuff. OK, so I'm going to go actually back to the airbrush for a little bit I think. Make a new layer. I'm going to grab the Airbrush and we're going to do a little bit of Airbrush and lasso tool on the neck and chest area. I feel like I. Haven't done enough work down here yet. So let's do that. I'm going to give a little bit more shadow under here. Read says I started doing a mixing chart of my watercolors. Some just don't mix together. I mean the result is ugly, not that the painting, not that the paint didn't blend. Oh, really, is it like a muddy color or something? That's interesting. Well, hey, I guess it's good to do the test to find out about that on those test sheet rather than in your painting. I'm trying to find out what to do with this. I could go back to my other brush for a second. Her neck. And the hair back here. It kind of. There's a little bit of a shadow trying to figure out. The proportions there so look a little bit of a shadow. Maybe just something like that's enough going overboard. You can try smudge tool blur. A little bit of it out. Yeah, that's better just to save the day. Thank you Stephanie. Yeah, I think if you if you detail the right places enough you can get away with leaving leaving other areas. And I think it's a cool. I think it's a cool look, and it's also fun because you know, if you want to do portrait study because they can be enjoyable to do and you don't have all the time in the world to render it out, you can still get some good practice in. You don't have to sit there and render every hair. To do a study to learn something about the facial features. But we will do a little bit more, especially because I will be honest. I might one of a weak point for me is the neck area. So I need to practice with. So I'm not going to. Uh. Yeah, see that difference. I want to jump out too soon. So we get more and shadow over on the side. The airbrushes nice for some areas that you do want to be smooth. Of course it makes sense. Alright, so. Put a little shadow. Sometimes when I make a selection to do this sort of airbrush thing, I like to then select the inverse. If I want to do some shading on the opposite side. That can be really handy. Hi Judy, thank you welcome. Doing a. Things and portraits. Today a little bit different. I know gnutella I really do need that. Speaking of different topics for art club, I should do a neck and collarbones study. Study group that would be really good. Good topic. But if anybody wants to take a look at the reference image, you can check the link below the stream in the description, and if you'd like to paint along and share what you do, you're welcome to. We welcome to just hang out and you have any questions, let me know. We're going to do another portrait after this. So if you missed the beginning, we will do one more. So I'm working on the chest right now because there's some. Details of her shirt that go over top here, so I think it'll be easier if I just sort this out real quick before we add those details. Your version right? So you make it Fox. Oh cool. I'll take it. Alright, let me check out jacklines link. Oh, nice study. Speaking of facial features. See, we still have to do mouths. An art club didn't get there quite yet. Nice and the neck too. A lot of complicated wrinkles and stuff. Nicely done. Oh nice, Judy Yeah we'll start another one. After this. All right, So what I'm doing is making a new layer painting for awhile on that layer until I'm happier with it and then merging down. So. At the current sort of polishing up that we're doing here. And so I'll be able to check and see do I like that and like to me. I think that went a little too dark in here so I can get rid of that. I think my interpretation of the lighting has been a bit more, maybe a bit more glowy, less shadows. I've noticed that when I'm painting, especially if you're painting, uh, a character or a person who is younger or has smooth skin. Um shadows painting shadows can be really. Tricky because it can sometimes age them. And it's so strange 'cause The Shadows will be there in the image and you're thinking, well, hey in the photo their shadows there with the heck I'm just trying to paint it like how it looks and then in the painting it looks like wrinkle or something. It's really tricky so. I one thing I found is like I think I tend to be a little bit more glowy or a little bit later on the shadows. For that reason, if I'm painting someone like this. Sorry for the flipping so much. I'm trying to figure out what. What is bothering me about the this area and sometimes the flipping. Really helps. So I'm going to color pic from this light spot on her face. An shifted a little bit to a cooler. Colour, but keep that brightness. For the highlights on her skin down here, 'cause it seems a lot. Um? Cooler, the lighting on her chest. Hi Taj. Welcome, I hope you guys are having a good day. Right, that's a little bit better. I have some sketch lines still here. If I zoom in you can see what I did earlier on in the process was I merged my sketch onto my painting so you can take the smudge brush and smudge away those lines. So they kind of blend in. Read says 1 trick. I read about this is this often is tomorrow. Yes, often the shadows on young people and do more hard edged shadows on aged people. Oh interesting, that makes sense. Make sense read. Have you used the same brush throughout? Yeah, I I don't mind questions at all. You're welcome to ask and I have used mostly the same brush. I'll show you the ones I've used so I have this one right here, which is this is the one I've used for most of the painting. The only other brush I've used is the airbrush an I've used this smudge brush so those have been the. Oh, there was one other brushed. Almost forgot. There was one of the brush and that was this one for some of the harder details, but all of these brushes, all four of them are in the free brush set that you can download below the stream in the description if you want the ones I used was the wet paint, the soft airbrush and the soft shading and blending, but this was this was the hero right here? This is the main one I really like that brush for painting portraits. Definitely a go to for me. Oh, I think that I'm about to answer your question Taj, because I think there's a little delay in the stream, so I think you're about to hear me answer your question, but if not, ask me again and I will tell you. OK, so I'm going to add the details of her shirt here. Real quick going across. I wanted to paint the skin first, 'cause I thought it would just be easier, but I think we're ready now. Well, we got food. That's about right. Actually, there's three. Not that we have to really make the exact same shirt, but you know. Try again, right? I'm going to put a layer on overlay and grab the Airbrush. Oh cool, nice to yeah, that's a really good brush for portraits. I almost never use it on landscapes, but I like it for people. OK, so I'm going to take the. Airbrush and choose like a blue, blue greenish color over here and. Actually maybe more towards purple, but I feel like her shirt. I've got it. I've got like a Gray color here, but I feel like the light is more blue in the image. So we'll do something like that. OK, so. Yeah, her shirt. I'm not really that happy with it. I think it has to do with the texture. Maybe I can kind of scribble in something here, but The thing is, I don't want to attract attention to the shirt. I want the attention to be on her face. But maybe there's some. Little details because of the hair light shining through the hair and maybe if we have. That shadow that'll Make more sense. I just wanted to be clear that this random Patch of blue is related to light and not just like a weird discoloration on her shirt, and I don't think I sold that yet. You know? It looks like it's getting a little bit better. Debating of adding the earring or not. Yeah, mine are a bit rough. But And I don't know if it's really needed to go much more detailed. I was thinking about adding like some just harder. A little bit harder highlights randomly for a bit to look like a glimmer out of focus. Little glimmer on the. The ring and that could make it look more metallic. But again, all those little things are adding noise and detail and distraction to areas other than her face. So I'm using this much brush to blur out some of the edges. I really want to keep the most interesting part, the most detailed part to be her face. In the earrings can compete with that. We can give a little shine to the eyes, but haven't done that yet. That's always fun. So I'm seeing a little shine, will get through like a blue light. Little white blue actually. Desaturate a little more. So something like this and then sometimes what I like to do is erase out. So make a big shimmer and then kind of cut into it in a couple of places and I can look like those you know. Like maybe it's shining through her eyelashes or something like that. Or you know the reflection of various objects that have different. Details in them. During say so much about personality, that's true, yeah? Little bit of personal files coming through there. Her lips don't have. She is kind of like a matte lip color on. I can add a little bit of detail there, but for the most part her lips aren't very shiny or anything. Of course we could take artistic license and the as shine, but. I think they look good. The way they are. Little bit shine on the edge of the nose. The I sign is always satisfying to put in. I really toned it down a bit though, because once you zoom out it's funny. What reads will add a distance and what doesn't. Sometimes those things can be really distracting. So one thing I notice she is very long eyelashes and in the photo actually some of her eyelashes are coming out into the light bar enough that they're like catching the sunlight a little bit. So I'm not going to bother with that, but that's just like something to note. I guess is that. Sometimes eyelashes, even though she has a dark eyelashes. In the light, you may actually try to indicate them with highlight. Can't we are hearing because of allergies? All I'm sorry red. I guess, huh? While I've I've heard of that was like different types of metals and stuff like that. To be honest, I almost never wear earrings. I have like a couple pairs that you rings that I wear every once in awhile, but. I usually find it most comfortable not to really wear. Where stuff like that. So I'm putting a couple little flyaways and things little shines. I'm trying to decide if they really fit or not. I think I like the shines up top. Not sold on the random flyways yet though. Alright, we have a lighter highlight on the hair. Down here is less of a warm color. More bright white. Maybe part of the reason it doesn't fit so well. These really, really bright lights is because I kind of toned, toned it down a little bit in mind like we don't have a totally overexposed thing. We could add some color Dodge this, just play with it. I'm going to make a new layer, put it on color, Dodge and turn off the transparency shapes layer so one more time. If you have a layer and you select a color, dodges your layer blending mode. You can paint. And it's going to have this kind of effect, but I prefer how it looks if you double tap the layer and uncheck transparency shapes layer, it'll give the color Dodge a little bit of a different effect. This is I've changed, nothing else, only that and it, and I think it makes it a lot better. It depends on what you're using the color Dodge for, but for painting I like to do that. So we can just come in an add some extra little pop of light in the areas where it's just following the reference and we'll just see what we think about it. Let's just do it and see what we think about it. We could judge too soon. Codage can really overexpose stuff and it can be a bit too much, but it can also be really beautiful and kind of bump up lighting that you already have going on. I usually don't use color Dodge to do the lighting about a sometimes use it to add a little extra after you've already painted an area to go back in and. Brighten things up a little bit more so you can see this. Effect over on the shoulder. It was a little bit more like the actual photo. If we do something like this. And. That is kind of fun actually. So before and after. So I kind of like what it did with the hair, specially on the right. I feel like what it did on her face is a bit too much, so I'm going to take a big airbrush and just kind of tap over her face and start erasing that out. And then let's see. Yeah, I want her face to be. This is more of like from behind her. Almost what's happening with the. The lighting Ha, that's funny crazy. Yeah, that's right, read. Well, I'm going to duplicate the background layer well, my painting and. Do merge the color Dodge layer down. So I'm going to keep both versions. 2. I'm going to keep both versions, but I want to try smudging this a little bit after the color Dodge. This seemed really harsh. Some of those up here. Hoping maybe I could smash that out and I will improve. Where was this option? OK, so one more time with the color Dodge 'cause, so this is a weird thing, but I don't really know what it's doing, but it's it's awesome so you double click the layer and under the blending options it's what should come up by default when you double click the layer you uncheck the transparency shapes layer and then press OK and then then you want to put your layer on color Dodge mode. There's another way to get this effect too. If you make a new layer and you fill a black paint bucket on the layer, and then you put that layer on color, Dodge, and paint, it's going to have the exact same effect too, as if you did the uncheck transparency shapes layer thing. So it's the same thing. I don't know why it works. But it works. OK, well there's our. There's our portrait of the time it is. I could work on it a little bit more, but I feel like. I feel like it's, uh. Right, I feel like I'm happy with it. For a quick study portrait. The area may be catching my attention a little bit. Is the corners of the mouth. Maybe our little too dark or too. Desaturated. OK so I'm going to put the layer on a layer on Layton. And paint in. Like a warm Brown red. To lighten up a little bit so light and is really cool. Lighten and darken layer blending modes actually use a lot. I think that kind of underrated, but what they do is when you're painting on lighten mode, it's going to only affect layers. I mean, sorry colors that are darker than the one you're painting with, so you can see as I paint across her. It's only going to lighten the dark areas. It's not going to do anything to the light areas, so you can. So I can lighten those details of her on her in her lip area, but it doesn't affect any of the area that's already been painted that is. Lighter. David says you can also paint into a black layer with the additive blend mode. There is an additive effects composite. Oddly is that transparency is done after the full composite up to the layer. Yeah, so the one I used to do David before I found out about the black layer is I would like I would just be like I need to merge everything. You know what I mean 'cause I would I would love how it looked if I you know if you paint another thing you can do is if you have everything merged. You can paint with your brush. On color Dodge mode. So before I found out about using the black layer or using the transparency shapes layer, what I would do when I was just kind of playing around figuring things out I would I would have. I would merge everything and then I would put my brush on color Dodge Mode and I would use that. And I was so. Like I thought it was so wild that how, how things looked when I would work like this was so different. And so I would usually save color Dodge for like one of the last things I would do in a painting an I would merge everything and use the. The color Dodge over here on the brush. So all these other ways are much better and much less destructive, which is awesome. But I definitely get what you're saying about the transparency. That's something that started to. I started to notice just because of like how things were working. Like if I was doing it on a layer that wasn't merged any of the area. Yeah, it's you're right, it's not necessary. It's not super intuitive, but it's at the same time when you deal with it a lot. You could start to see the patterns of how it's working. Strange thing about the way Photoshop does composite operation. Basically because every layer is doing multiple composites blend mode plus transparency flows opacity. Well, thank you. Thank you so much faster. Thanks you guys. Um, we're going to do another portrait from the start together. Now I'm going to take a quick moment to get some more water and just take a quick stretch in between paintings here. But it'll be like just a couple minutes at most so it'll be pretty fast and I'm just kind of get up, stretch and come back for a new portrait. So if you guys want to join in the next one, the reference images below the stream in the description. Reference image #2 you can find down there. And. Also, above the chat, in the info tab you can find the reference there too, so this is the next one we're going to do. We're having with the lovely ladies being day. I just have been saving these images for awhile and. Yeah, was in the mood to do this, so I hope you guys like them. We're going to do that one next so I will quickly whoops. I'll click quickly, go on the Barbie screen and come back if you guys have any paintings you want to share. If you were painting along with me on this last one, I would love to see what you did. Take your time. There's no rush, but whenever you want you can upload into. Into the chat your are you do have to post it somewhere so that you can get a URL and then put the URL in the chat and I'll check it out. Really pretty Jackson. Thank you so much for painting with me. I always enjoy seeing your work. Hey Ryan. Welcome anybody who got here while I was away on a quick break. We are back. Hey guys. So we're going to do thank you. Thank you for the welcome back everybody. We're going to do another portrait and I'm just going to get set up. If anybody was painting along for the last one. If anyone else. We just took a look at Jackson's work. If anyone else wants to share you can post. You're in the chat whenever you're ready. You can feel free to like. Keep going on it, no rush, share whatever. To get set up with the next one, we're going to do paint this woman holding. Yellow Flowers So let's get our reference. This is the image we're going to be painting. I find profile views pretty tough. This is basically a profile we can see a little bit of her eye peeking from the other side, so I think that's going to be a little challenging, but. Good thing to practice and there's an ear in this one. We are studying ears as part of the current art club topics. I wanted to pick one of our portraits today that showed an ear. So yeah, this is the next one and you guys can find the link below in the description stream description. If you want to grab the reference and do a quick sketch with us or paint along and I'm going to put the. The reference up here with pure ref. There we go. Thank you valya. Thank you, so if you guys wanted to see the first one, if you were. If you were just getting here and you weren't here for the first painting after stream, you can always re watch the video. It'll be available on my profile on the videos tab you can find it there. Usually it takes a couple hours after the stream to process the video and then it will be available. Hyper welcome everybody. Alright, I'm going to make an you canvas. OK, so the canvas size is true 1000 by 2500 pixels. That is the size of the reference image and I think that's a good size for me. I am just doing these for practice. I'm probably not going to be printing them, so that's plenty big enough. I think for practice and for something that I might just post on line. So that's big enough. And then let's say that. Half a woman with. Yellow Flowers I like the title my paintings, as if their stock photo titles. Your hype, yay. OK. So I'm going to talk through my process. You guys are welcome to ask questions you have any. See if I can move this over a little bit. And what time is it? Oh, we're doing pretty good so I could spend. I have with them out of time I have to stream today I'm looking to make this portrait like a two to three hour portrait, so that's the plan. For the next one, the profile SRO referee link could be pretty useful, at least for me. Thank you for bringing that up. I'm almost forgot about that. So earlier you guys earlier I shared a an image for the first portrait that I did I was looking or I had in mind this reference and I added it to my reference page. This is a. Planes of the head model created by John SRO. This is I forgot the year. This is pretty old now. I think it's from like the 70s, but this is great design. It's really helpful. You can find photos of this. The link is below in the description you can find a link to download these photos. Someone uploaded them for free on Polycount which is really nice that you can grab them and use them for studying and in your art. So this is one that would probably be pretty good. Or maybe the other ones even further to the side. But it really helps if you're feeling confused about the angles of a face. To look at that. OK, so I'm going to get rid of the black. Sorry the white background first of all. And. I might just, instead of popping in, I usually just pop in a Gray background. But this time the background in the actual reference bit of actual photo is. Basically a gradient with a lot of Gray in it, so I think what I'm going to do instead of dropping a paint bucket is. Just. Try to match what I'm seeing in the reference. Just have a starting point. So. One thing that I like to do at the beginning of a painting is sort of take my time and take a moment to actually really look at the picture and I'll turn it into black and white. And see like what is the brightest thing in the image? What is the darkest thing you know? What are the values look like? Overall, the background is so her skin in most places is about the same tone as the background. It's a little bit darker, but then some areas the highlights are lighter. So the dress is darker than the background. The hair is much darker, but looking at those relationships with the shading and values kind of helps me out. And taking a moment to just, you know, think through it a little bit before starting. That can be good to do. So I'm going to grab a sketch brush. Or any brush relief. Any brushes, small scale size. You can schedule it basically so I'm going to take this one and just start start sketching it in an if you guys were here on the last one you saw and you'll see here too that my sketches are often really messy when first starting out. I'm hoping this is something that's just going to get better with time I feel like my environment sketching his improved a bit. I haven't been practicing on humans that much, but my sketches are like looking like stick figures most of the time when I start and so I've just kind of come to terms with it. But Luckily you can build on top of that, so I'll usually start out with something that's pretty rough. And then if I do want to make it more clean and more polished, I'll just turn that layer onto lower opacity and trace over it. And clean it up and you can just do that as many times as you need to to get it looking better. Which is which is awesome. The negative is sometimes your original sketch will have a little bit more like gesture and motion to it. So if the kind of be careful with that when you're polishing sketches up that they sometimes they will lose that. Motion to them but. Alright, let's flip. I'm going to flip my reference on the other monitor to while I'm doing this. Sometimes it'll help me notice things. Angles and things high pablos. How are you? Going to choose the harder brush for my eraser. I don't like having an airbrush is my eraser ahead like that from the previous painting. I'm near good to see you. So part of her is covered by the Flowers, so it's a little tricky, but I think basically what's happening is. Her upper body is like this. And she just she has the Flowers here. And holding them toward her an I'm going to just sketch the. Outline of the flower shape. Of the whole bouquet. Something like that. Jennifer says I have sketches from Disney pioneers that look very messy and then more detailed so you're doing good. Thank you. That's good to hear. Yeah, it's almost always a mess with the beginning. Way too often I like the sketch more than the final product, so it's a good tip. Yeah, I try to. I try to like if I do like a more polished version. I try to turn on and off the and look at the sketch layer. And try to keep it in mind for that. So hard, isn't it? So I'm just going back on top of my sketch now and sort of solidifying some of the lines that I like. I'm happy with. And ignoring the ones that I don't really care for. Hey pro designer, I hope you're having a good day. I made some mango P today. Smells very good. He is a must have for painting or. For coffee or coffee. Alright, looking at the head proportions we got a little work to do. So I like to look at where things match up. To help give me idea of what I'm doing, like for example her shoulder here kind of matches up with where her chin starts and then how far does that come out and about. Where does that line up with the Flowers? Things like that helps find out their relationships in size between things. Like her neck over here. I think so it comes out the bun. The edge of the shirt kind of meets up with a bun like that. Is almost like more of a mathematical way of thinking about it so. Maybe it's not as appealing, but it does help those help. If you're like just checking proportions and things. I want to make sure that it's making sense. Fish in it does taste good that he does taste good, it just it has such a strong smell to it more than usual for T discuss the mango so intense. I like it. He's also must have for watching the stream. Ohio cheers. I hope you're having a good day fishing. I can show you the painting, we just did. Actually we're starting a new one at the moment, but this was the first one. So I'm. The the lighting in this one was like absolutely my favorite. I love the lighting. This one is a little bit less. Maybe a little less glamorous lighting. But Hopefully we can still do something good with it. I find certain types of lighting scenarios little bit easier. And generally I feel like when there's a bright splash of light. I find that easier and I don't know why. I have some hypothesis of why it is. But I think it makes it well. I think the drama is always nice. It's just sort of flashy and pretty. But I think it's also easier to get make things look 3 dimensional when you have the angles really harshly illuminated, and sometimes when the lighting is more even. You don't. You can't do that as easily. Address of Mario dressed in a Ferrari suit. Haven't finished it yet. Well, you're welcome to share it. If you want to, or if you want to wait till it's finished. The other great out a portrait I haven't in a long time I when I was in school we had to do some portraits that were grid out. And I found it really useful as far as like getting accurate results, but I don't love to paint that way regularly or draw that way regularly because it feels kind of. It's not as fun to me. It takes a little. I I just it's just not as fun, you know? And I really want to get better at Freehand, so that's mostly the reason I don't do it, but but with what I was talking about with matching up and looking at proportions in a way that is kind of greeting, it's just sort of a like Mini. Version of it just kind of observing how things match up. Oh, thank you. Fishing was thank you. It was a beautiful photo. Photo that I was painting from. Oh, that sounds good. I'm glad you were able to get out and about a little bit. Like these days. Thank you bro. Hey Emily, good to see you. Gave some some proportions, things with the. Yeah, I think this angle is going to be little tricky for me. So it's almost the profile. Would you guys call this a profile view? Does it count? It's like almost a profile, but there's just a little bit of her eyes showing from the side. I'm not even sure if there's an official word for what this is. Angle live. Right, so I like to flip the canvas quite a bit when I'm painting portraits to help me notice things that are wonky. It's definitely raining. Putting some alarms off in my head right now. When I'm flipping, looking at the eyes and stuff. Uhm Yeah. Scenary Hi Welcome. Thanks for being here. France is not here yet, but sometimes if I'm doing a Commission and I really need to nail a likeness but generally don't take the path of least resistance. Yeah, yeah, that would be. That would be a good time to do it. Definitely, then you want to have as little yeah you little room for mistakes possible. But It's funny you say path of least resistance. I do agree that in some ways it makes things easier because you know it lines things up for you, but in other ways I find it it harder because I find it hard to discipline to do all that kind of preparation with greeting everything out before painting things like drawing. I just want to get to it. So I gotta say give people credit who who do that because I don't think it's necessarily is definitely a lot of work involved. Definitely a lot of work involved in setting that up so. Alright, so there should be more so looking at proportions there should be more room. Between her or her eyebrow and. The hairline beginning. At that counts as a profile. OK, cool, you're a nice. Alright. We're painting a profile. Yeah, I'm having a good day pro. I've been really enjoying stream so far. Is going by quickly actually? But it's a good day. One thing that you can do to sort of check your work which is. Honestly, this this is a bit. It can be a bit rough emotionally 'cause you're like. Oh, you're going to see really how off things are, but you can take the reference and paste it on top of your work and then. Look like this. Now of course, her positioning is a little different, but I can do this kind of thing and see. So. Proportions Of the like lips and nose and chin are not bad, but look at the ear was going on there. So I made the ear way too big. But anyway, this kind of stuff, even though it can be a bit jarring when you'd lined it up and you realize all the mistakes. It's good for learning an check, checking your work, and if you don't have like someone there to give you a feedback real quick and you want to try to get that info for yourself, that's a way you can look at it. If you're painting from one specific. Reference then you can overlap it like that. Take a look. Right, there's 100% agree I find greeting out of drawing harder takes longer, so just going freehand or whatever, not use any grid, is the passively path of least resistance to me too. OK, I understand what you said. Now I understand. I think I read it the opposite way first. Yeah, definitely definitely. Reached resistance to just get in and start drawing it out. He drawing lips at this angle. Mine always turn out like fish list. Well, when we get to the lifts maybe I can give some some tips on that that's funny. Do you prefer digital sketching? Painting over using a good old pencil and paint brush? You know, I, I find it impossible to choose between digital and traditional like it's so hard and I know it's been copping out, but I can never answer this question like I love both mediums. I do both regularly. And I would be really sad if I had to like give up either digital or traditional. I'm not sure 'cause there's there's there's little pros and cons here in there with both of 'em like digital is so much more. Versus Thailand Editable and you know you can just try things on a whim, whereas with the traditional you know, let's say you've done a nice painting so far and you have an idea for something you want to try out, but then you're worried? Oh, I'm going to mess up my whole painting if I do that now. You can just experiment so freely in digital. You don't have those issues that holding you back as much. For me. Speaking for me, I don't get held back by that feeling in digital. I'm like willing to try whatever because you know, there's no loss. You can just. Undo or go back if you don't like it. There's so many editing tools which makes things easier like for me I'm able to move around. I mean look at all the changes I've made to her already, so I would have had to take a very different approach if I was doing this. Traditionally, I probably would have spent a lot longer in the first rough sketch phase that I did hear. I probably would have not gone through that so quick knowing that I need to maybe make changes. Yeah, it's different. However, as far as like pros and cons, something that I like about traditional is the textures. And I find that in my digital work I'm always experimenting with how I can imitate those textures, and I do feel like the technology is getting better for that, but I still find that there are certain looks of are really tough could recreate. So yeah, there's pros and cons to both, but I like doing both 'cause I feel like they help inspire each other, like doing traditional I think has made my digital work more a little bit more interesting lately because I'm really trying to bring in those texture things into my digital work. Oh, thank you you are that's so nice of you. Thank you. They're trying to scale up on digital painting. Had to do some quick sketches the other day and pencil realize how much I rely on control Z. Yeah, for me the transform tools like this are so handy 'cause it's You'll draw a nose and it's like, OK. The nose is fine, but it's like a little bit too far over in traditionally erase the whole thing is just a lot faster to be able to just move it over or use warp stuff like that. And we both grading is actually transferred technique used for murals. So basically when grading you don't do much more than copy something without thought about shapes and forms. I would recommend your technique. And I did use a grid for for doing a mural. It's really hard to paint a mural and keep things in proportion 'cause you're like so close to what you're painting, and it's so big it's like impossible to get a step to get a proper step back view of it. I asked one question last Wednesday. Do you remember that? Oh what my favorite painting is. Yeah, I still don't know. I don't think I can choose one painting that's too hard pro. It's too hard like. I don't know. I don't think I can choose one painting that I that resonates with me above all others. There's too many paintings that I love. Too many paintings. Like if I had to look at one painting forever. If I could only hang up one painting. I don't know. I don't know which one it would be. And why are the lips so hard? Alright, there slightly parted. So I do think I'm going to be able to sort some of these things out more in the. In the painting phase, but I'm trying to. Get a little bit closer. Before I go into painting. Trying to at least. Please get to a point where the painting will be. I have some some guidance for myself, so that's why I'm doing this sketch. So her eyes are slightly open there. She's looking down. Yeah, I agree, she does look like a dancer. The way she's holding that pose. Oh Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, I wonder if I can find it. So here is asking about a painting I did a while back. I mentioned the other day that. I would go look it up. Um so. Off topic from the. From the painting for a moment. I've done a lot of I do a lot of virtual Plein Air Studies and speed paints and things like that. I've been mostly focused on environments, but when I started doing time studies, I wasn't strictly doing environments. I was also doing more portraits, not more portraits and environments, but more portraits than what I'm doing nowadays. I was still doing quite a bit of portraits sprinkled in here we go. So this is from. Let's see, when is this from? It's what is the date on this file? September of 2018. So this is getting close to two years ago. Now, but this is a. 45 minutes study of Lagertha. I promise I will show it to. Tiara, so here it is, yeah. I didn't get very far. It's crazy the what this looks like, so I was using a triangular brush right now. It almost looks like one of those Polygon type paintings. But yeah, that was my only painting of legacy. Uh. I should try again now. See for me, profiles are the hardest to draw. Yeah, I also find them really difficult, so this should be good practice. You guys are able to actually choose a favorite painting. I'm impressed. I am impressed. When I painting broken column from Freda, I'm gonna have to look that up now. Ah, cool. I'm not familiar with that one. OK, well I'll get back to. I'll get back to my painting but very interesting you guys. Thanks for sharing. Yeah, maybe one day I'll think of find a favorite painting, but I've never been good at choosing favourites of things. You know what I mean? It comes with songs, movies. It's always like it depends a bit on on mood and all kinds of things. It kind of changes overtime and it's hard to think of one that's just the ultimate favorite. Because there's, you know they do different things. Oh, thank you Claire Z. Thanks, Foster. Yarra I appreciate it. Almost like heavy paint app, I've been really wanting to try that app Makaveli. I opened it and I like I was like. This is crazy. Seems really hard, but kind of a fun challenge. Thanks you guys. Thanks for the nice comments. She's so pretty that actress. I don't know the name of the real of actress, but that the woman who plays Lagertha's is really beautiful. So I was excited to try to paint her. Alright, well. I'm really struggling with this eyebrow like I understand that this one it's going like this by for some reason. I'm having a really hard time. It's like I can see that it's going down. But I can't seem to paint it like that. Like this? Right? Yeah. Well I am just going to have to start and sort this out in the painting phase because for some reason drawing these eyes it's just. Absolutely breaking my brain right now. It's something like this. Jennifer says that's exactly why I love art. You don't have to have one favorite all the time. It could change with how you're feeling. Just like music. Yeah, just like that. It's it's hard to pick a favorite song. And painting. OK, well I think that's. As close as I'm going to get for now. Let's start with the painting. So I'm going to put the layer on, multiply an lower the opacity so that we can barely see it. But it is still there as a guide, and then I'll lock that layer. Anne will make a new layer and start painting, so I'm going to go back to this soft shading and blending brush, which I was using for the first painting today. And. You can find this brush in the free brushes past below the stream in the description if you want. But I'm going to be using this one and I'm trying to begin without color picking from the reference. Will see on my end up color picking if I get stuck and we want to get unstuck. But I'm going to try to visualize it. She has a ton of freckles when she's not wearing makeup. She's so pretty. Katheryn Winnick. Oh, really. She has a lot of freckles. I wonder why they did they. I don't remember in the show. I wonder why they would cover the freckles. Anyway, that's that's cool. I'll have to look her up. Maybe we can do a portrait of her. Mine's gone very Freda Calo. I'm referring to the state of her eyebrows, not my style of drawing. I don't know why, but the eyebrows were the hardest part of this for me. I hope you have a digital pen or stylus. Hi Saurav, I hope you can too. I hope you can do. So digital painting it's definitely a lot easier and more workable with a stylus, but there are other types of digital art you could get into if you can't get a stylus quite yet. Vector art could be a really good option in the meantime. If you use something like Adobe illustrator because that type of art is a bit more possible to do with with a mouse or Pixel Art's or. Vector style clean vector style artwork could definitely work or you can always, you know, do some pencil and paper sketching and preparation. But there are definitely things you can do in the mean time. If you want. I hope you're able to get a Silas soon. I have three depending on mood. Ooh, good choices. Ioras sharing a link Oh wow. Yeah, I see I see. Time jump makeup test. Nice freckles Medford new yeah yeah that's cool. I wonder if she has other roles she's done with the freckles showing. But she's a good actress. OK, so I'm blocking in the whole body in the same color right now, just because I want to. Get this. Get this box in, will get will get more specific with the dress and this and that. OK, so. For the last painting, I painted her attached to the background and I'm really considering doing that here too for a more painterly effect. I don't know if I want to paint the details of what's going on behind her. It looks like a bed. Like a headboard of a bed or something like that. And I mean it's pretty, but I want the focus beyond her. If anything I might do something abstract back there. Like we could have some. Something like this so it looks like she's she's in a room and maybe there's some kind of details furniture, or who knows a window. We whatever is back there, you know. Something blurred out. Might do something like this and just start painting with her right on the background. what I like about that is then you can sort of paint back and forth with the background and foreground color and not have to erase out what would make sense to do first is to block in the her clothing color so she's all on one layer now so I'll press the lock transparency and. That way I can anything that I paint. It's only going to affect the layer that I already, the shape that I already created on that layer. Oh, it's going to be about two to three hours vision like you said, mainly just to the end of stream. So probably two to three hours for this one. Which I think it is going to take more time than the last one seems tricky. So doing something like this is a lot easier. Before we flatten it to the background. And you don't have to flatten yours. I'm a little bit merge happy, but. This is how I like to do it. But the her she's got very dark Brown. Black hair, it looks like it's reflecting a little bit, highlights a little bit Brown. That's very dark. And very striking with the red dress. All red I'm sorry. That sounds like a stressful situation, but I think he did the right thing. I mean, you were just looking out for him. It's like you said that kind of stuff can come back to bite you and it's just not a good way to be anyway, so. You were just trying to help. Hopefully they'll be able to see that. I'm going to erase out a little bit the shape of the bun. Just get that looking more interesting. And I think I will finally emerge this down to the background now. OK. We also can sketch in the Flowers, just roughly. I'm going to go with a. Warm yellow, green brownish yellow green. That's how I feel like they're looking. And I'm going to come back and work on these Flowers more. They're definitely not the important thing here. You can actually choose to leave them out if you wanted to focus on her face. If you're doing a study of her face and. That's just one thing too much. Taking up the time. Oh yeah, it's really not something you should feel bad about red. Hi Steven, thank you. Have you ever done any work with animals, cats, dogs, birds? Yes, not as frequently but I do. And uh. I wonder if I have any recent ones to share. I was recently painting a. Like a cat sleeping in the sunlight. We did a study like that, although the the painting was not so much about the cat. As like the whole scene kind of thing, but I do sometimes paint scenes with animals. It's just not most of the time, but I kind of want to do that more lately, like I've been trying to sort of refresh myself with painting. People with this stream and I hope they keep getting keep keep doing that. I want to paint some animals to just kind of keep in the groove with things like that. Um, guess the nurse is not easy to make your own brushes and which one just use most often. A good question. Well for today I'm using basically four brushes. This one. This one. This one and a smudge and all of these are in the brush pack, which you can download for free below the stream. In the description that one is a brushes that I have collected from other free brush packs over the years on the Internet. Also I have created some of the ones in that pack too, but it's just a collection overtime, but I also do make brushes and I've been. Work, I have one brush pack that's kind of already out that you can download and play with. It is for sale on artstation marketplace I'm on Gumroad. And. That one is linked below and description two. It's like a Ghibli inspired foliage and watercolor, gouache painting pack. An I'm working on and you brush pack right now. That's going to be finished soon and it's focused on traditional textures. So I do a little bit of both. Would be a little bit of both, but you can download the pack below stream. Hello Mother Mother ship thank you thank you, thank you Melina. Yeah, I'm trying to think I of the animals I've painted. I've painted a good amount of birds overtime. I find birds really fun to paint. The textures of the feathers and a lot of the feathers have like a reflective quality that I really like. And also you know they generally are in nice environments, and so I'm mainly environment painter nowadays I like to paint environments. Um, sometimes it can be nice to have little bird in the scene. You know something like that. It's just a little bit of extra. Life in the scene, but not a bunch of complication. Maybe like painting birds. So the early stages of getting color in a painting or always a bit rough. 'cause you have alot of things looking flat. And kind of just have to. Trust the process and. Remember that you guys go through the ugly stage and then keep going. It doesn't usually take too long to get through that. But it takes a bit a little bit of discipline. Remind yourself. Oops. My pen is falling apart. I have not had that happen before. There we go. So I generally like to make a new layer and then paint for awhile on that layer and then merge down once. I am happy with whatever it was done there on that layer. Oh, thank you clearly. Thank you so much. I'm happy you like the brushes. Have you checked out Amy tans drawing of birds? I bet you love her attention to details. Wonderful thank you for the recommendation. I don't know that name. I'll stop in my head so I'm going to look them up. Woo yes, very detailed. That is so cool. Here let me show real quick so you guys can see what we're looking at. If I found the right person which I believe so is this, is this the one? I'm a big fan of botanical art like this. This is different than what I do, but I really enjoy it and it seems to take so much patience and. He had his patience and focus to make such clean rendering. Oh, you're welcome. And thank you. Yes, in area thank you. Oh no fish and what is? What did I say? The cat has never been satisfied with his portrait. That's funny. I think you're right, Bravo. It's impossible to capture the true grandeur of a cat. Probably the problem. Alright, so let's get the eyebrow in here, the eyebrows, the dreaded eyebrows that confused me so much during the sketch phase. Hopefully this will go better in the painting. Sometimes thinking and shapes of really is easier than lines, so I hope that will happen here. Oh, thank you. Yes, my little sock, you can make one of these very easily if anybody is watching you can cut a sock to wear as a drawing glove. So if you have any spares And he cleaned spares. It's very handy. Yeah, thanks for the recommendation, Jennifer. All without the Stylus. Oh sorry, fish him. Yeah I see now. There was a bit of a delay so I was wondering if it was because I mentioned that. I prefer drawing drawing birds to fish. I didn't know if I upset you. Just kidding, of course. Yeah, Luckily my stylus is not actually broken, just for some reason this front part came loose. I think I've been slowly unwinding it with my with my hand grip. So in the last painting what I did was I merged the. Sketch on to the painting and continued painting from there, with the sketch being part of the painting and eventually kind of getting painted over and I think it worked out pretty well workflow wise so maybe I will. Do that again. Thank you, Murph, Murph. It thank you very much. Well, I do a lot of studies and I do a lot of timed painting. Studies is not all about speed, but that did help me get faster like doing putting on timer for a couple hours or whatever at time I had or wanted to do for the study and just kind of doing the best I could during that time. I've done a lot of those kind of time studies over the past couple of years. OK, let's see. Ooh clever, let me see, let me see, let me see. Oh how cute. Oh my gosh guys, look at this. That is the cutest happiest little cat face I've ever seen. Oh my gosh, that's adorable. I think you're right. I think that cat is very satisfied with his portrait. Vision, I mean, just kidding. I never said that. Oh man, clever, thank you. That was wonderful. OK, what I'm going to do is duplicate the sketch layer so I can have it just as my leg safety net you buy. We might come back and need to overlay it. If I somehow get, I don't know if I go off on the tangent and I want to remember what my schedule is like, so I'll just leave a copy of it and then the duplicated version. What I'm going to do is erase everything I don't need. So basically everything related to the around the figure and stuff I think were good there. The issue is really the face. So. I'm going to merge that part down. And then we'll keep going from here. Oh well, thanks Kevin. I've gotten better at. Multi tasking, so I've been streaming for a few years now and so it's gotten better as I have gotten more practice talking and painting at the same time I will admit that. My focus isn't quite as good as it would be if I was just painting alone, but it is worth it. It is a lot is a lot of fun. It's a different experience and I love getting through. Have like feedback and chat with you guys and everything. It's definitely worth it. I still paint off stream and do that if I am like leading to 100% focus on something but. You know? That looks like my cat sunning herself so cute. Yes, I want to do more studies in my style like you do I don't know if you've seen lotion sketchbooks, but she also does such a great job at taking a reference in drawing it in her own style. Yes, jarisch, I have like I've been inspired by her a lot in that particular way. She has a few specifically. There's some sketches that she did up on some kind of summer vacation that she went on. There's like a whole series of them. And those in particular, I just absolutely love how she stylize them. I know exactly what you're talking about. I agree, and you can do it. You can do it, it just takes it like everything. It just takes practice and. You're probably not going to get the results that you like in the first few, but if you keep doing it, you will get there 100%. How long have you been digital painting about? Like almost Seven years like 6 1/2 going on Seven years? Now I've been doing digital painting. And before that I did traditional. Um, drawing, I didn't do much painting before this, so it was interesting as interesting transition for me from traditional to digital because it was a combination of transitioning from, you know. To a digital medium, but also my mindset going from drawing to painting, thinking of things in shapes and thinking about color. 'cause all my drawings previously were like black and white. There's little exceptions here and there, but vast majority of what I was doing was black and white drawing. France says here's my quick warm up for work, but not really take. Oh cool. Check this out you guys. This is a pixel art rendition from Ryan in the chat. So cool. I love that. I absolutely love it. I am using a centriq. I have the Centriq 22 is the one I have. OK. And pixel art looks like so much fun. So I like that this is merged the background, because now I can just color pic from the background and paint over her skin and vice versa to try to fix this area. So there's light shining here, just looking at the planes of the face. I feel like her. Mouth Position. In some work still going to work on this part. Love Pixelart me too on my pixel Art Appreciator I'm not a pixel art creator yet. So maybe someday soon I'm very interested in dabbling in. It is just like. I haven't had time, but I really like it. So it's funny. 'cause then the other. The other painting that I did earlier I had the issue of the lips being too close to the nose and this time I think I did the opposite. Need to move the lips up closer to the nose. Each person has a different shape and distance between. You know the features. So I'm trying to pay attention to that. I know Jackson. I'm having that too. So funny. Oh Do Pixar or my iPad pro? Isn't Andy and use a mouse rather than walk upstairs and grab it slowly? Hey, if it if it causes you to make this awesome pixel art then. I can't. I have nothing to say about it. Alright, so it looks like she's pursing her lips right now, but I want to make it look like her lips are slightly parted. I'm using a brush that's very hard to scale down to a detailed to detail work, so I might end up switching brushes, but I'm trying to use this one as long as I can 'cause. I think it keeps my painting feeling fresh when I use a bigger. Bigger brush I know that might not make sense. 'cause I'm my brushes kind of I'm scaling it down as much as I can for this brush. But try not to go down to it through it, even smaller one. If you ever have trouble with that kind of stuff, like if you get sucked into do details too soon, my tips are. To use a big chunky brush, stay zoomed out. As much as possible, staying zoomed out is probably the biggest tip. I mean, I'm a little bit zoomed in right now, but this is like as close as I want to get until we get into much more later phase in that painting. Alright, I'm going to pay attention to the neck too. Because I have the tendency to ignore. The later and then. Oh yeah. Was interested in face painting, the facial features and not so interested in the. The neck and and that stuff. Going to grab an airbrush because this area has a lot of very soft curves like the neck here is not a hard edge. I think that I think the Airbrush will be helpful. There's a very soft rounded edge to her draw. And there's a bit of bounce light which I have friends addressed yet, but she is going to have some within the shadows. She's going to have some warm light bouncing. It looks probably off the dress on to her. So making a selection for the. Collar bone. And just filling in with the airbrush. So I really like using the lasso tool airbrush combo to paint in areas, especially when they have a hard and soft edge. And then I just use the smudge brush to blur out. Any edges that remained little bit too sharp. So that dress. More like this. I see. Oh goodnight, Tesla. Thanks for hanging out sweet dreams. See next time. Kevin says I did my first digital sketch of lady in the tramp last year for a project. That work could be good to get your thoughts, let's take a peek here. Oh wow, what did you use for this? That is amazing that this is a painting. It almost looks like it's a photo of like. Or a? A 3D model, it looks very 3 dimensional. It looks like it could be like a plushy toy or something like that. Like it's very, very 3D. The way the shading is under here and the texture of the fur. That's so cool. Yeah, it really looks like it could be a like a product like a 3D. Like a toy or something. A lot of patience with those textures. So the Flowers are casting a shadow onto her. Just a little bit. There's not a very hard light source in this painting is all pretty soft alright. Painting in the in the in the photo. But There still is a shadow. Oops, while those not the color, I thought I had colored hip Superintendent. OK, so I've been painting for quite awhile on normal layer, but I do like to use layer blending modes. And. Let me see I think the chat is moving a bit fast, see. Uhm yeah, scenario says. I'm drawing only my PC. Oh, since he's 24 HD touch, but that's. That's a very nice. Tablet. I have an iPod and I also have the welcomes antique. Yes narian. I prefer painting on the centriq. I feel more secure with my set up. iPad is nice for like going out and sketching on the go kind of thing and I know a lot of people. A lot of artists that use it as their main set up an feel comfortable with that. I think part of the issue with me is that it's knew tamilan. I'm much more familiar with painting on the Santee 'cause I've been doing this for like almost Seven years now and the. IPad I only got a few months ago. So maybe I'm very biased towards the Centriq 'cause I'm so much more comfortable with it. But I personally prefer it. I prefer those in peak if I'm going to do polished work, I like to sit at my desk and have my setup very secure like the iPad. I don't have a stand for it as well, so it's not a fair comparison, but that's just my personal experience. Um? Fish and says any plans to do a character in landscape peace in the pipeline, kind of like you did in the past before you started to do the landscape studies with your new style. I would like to explore that yes Fish and so the last stream that I did hear I actually did have it was from reference so I wasn't necessarily creating a unique composition, but I did paint a woman in a environment and I haven't finished it yet. It was nearly finished at the end of stream, but I wanted to tweak it a little bit more and clean it up and. You know, add some things and stuff like that. I wonder if I can pull it up real quick to show. Woman with branch. That was the. That was that. That was the there was a woman holding a big branch and I. We changed it to Flowers in my version, so this is a very even though it is a natural. I mean it is a background. It's very abstracted and this one is still unfinished, but. I do want to get more into combining them, but. It's going to be probably at a slow pace here in there doing it. Um? I don't have any particular project that's like sort of throwing the into doing this right away, but it's something I do want to work towards, so we'll be doing more of that here in there. Um, about Seven years are of about Seven years for painting. But before that I did a lot of drawing like basically my whole life. I've been interested in art and drawing, so since I was a kid. I was drawing and then. Got into painting later on. Oh wow, no way Kevin, that's so cool. Got moved on to plush toy design. Guy asked to create plush toy for Disney, that's awesome, congratulations. Holy cow, yeah, it looks. It looks really well. That's perfect for based on what you used it for. Yeah. Crazy, right? I always made my paintings that are there like named as if their stock photos. So for me. Woman with branch woman with red dress. And Flowers. I can't, I can't. I can't come up with creative names for my paintings. I have to save all that energy for the painting. I have none left for titles. Oh, you're welcome. You're welcome, necessary. OK, so. What can we do next? So yeah, I was talking about layer blending modes, so I'm going to make a new layer and put it on overlay because I want to like bump up the color on the dress a little bit. An overlay is very intense. With the saturating I don't know if this is going to be too much. But I like to use overlay if I want to give like some subsurface scattering to the skin or just kind of saturate a little bit more so. Let's try that. I'm using an airbrush and I'm going to go very carefully to not over do it, but I'm going to add a little bit of legwork blush just to make it look like there's some warmth in life in her face and skin. Now, ideally, I would have picked the perfect colors when I was painting maybe, and I wouldn't have to add this, but it's wonderful to have these tools. I love that that's one thing I really, really love about digital when we talk about. Different things, digital and traditional. I love that I can just come here and. Sort of add almost a filter over what I've already painted without having to redo things. I can add this little bit of extra color. Hi Marianna. Welcome. Yes, so if you want to watch the stream later, usually just takes a couple hours after the end of stream for it to process and then the video will be available again to re watch if you visit my page. And go to videos tab. You'll find all the past streams are there, and as far as the paintings I'm working on, I usually post them. Either he ran be hands or on my Instagram. Sometimes I most of the time I just post my favourites on be hands. I want to post my better work here, but I sometimes I'll post other things on Instagram that are a little bit less polished but still want to share. Let's declares, he says. You need to start naming those like on the wish flower shop website. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious. You guys, women with capital letters, red dress wearing red, holding Flowers, yellow Flowers. Oh my gosh, I need to at least name one painting in that format. It's hilarious. My last painting is called badly painted young Russian woman Steven. Oh, I'm sure it's not badly painted, but that's also kind of adorable. I like it. There's a sense of humor there. Alright, well I think I'm I'm trying not to over saturate too much. This red 'cause we could easily get there. There's another way we can address this too so I'm going to lower the opacity, emerge that down. We can also use adjustment layers so on the bottom of my layers palette I can select the little half circle icon here. Let me just move this over so you can see 'cause I think my camera is blocking it. Let's try again. There you go. So yeah, click this button here and then we can go to select selective color. And then choose a Reds. And we can. Just edit basically the red things in the painting is not wild. I love selective color. I usually don't use this until the end of a painting and then I'll go in and change some things around or tweak things. But it's so powerful. Like you don't have to make any selections or anything, you can just. Go through these sliders and. Have a ton of. Freedom and you can mask things out so. Here's the here's what I did. If I don't want that effect in certain areas, but I do want to others, I can just click on this square here and then take my airbrush or whatever brush you want to use. If you paint with black, it will mask away that effect. So maybe I want it to be darker down here, less red. And then. Anywhere that you want to get rid of that. If you think it's doing too much, you can just erase away and then if you go back with white then it will come back. So yeah, but you can keep this separate. It's a very non destructive way to do these edits because you can always come back. I just wanted to show how to do that. I don't mind it being part of the paintings, I'll just merge it in but. Yes, very very handy. Get back over here layers. OK. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm glad you like my rendition of her. I'm going to try a little bit of color Dodge for fun here. I'm going to do the same effect as earlier, so I'm going to double click on the layer an unchecked transparency shapes layer, and then I'm going to put my layer blending mode on color, Dodge the light that's coming into this room seems a little bit. Cold like it doesn't seem like a warm late in the day evening light. You know it seems like a very bright light. Like a like a white white. Just how I'm reading it so. If I'm going to add a little bit of light shining on her, for example with the again with the airbrush, want to add these big. Lighting effects I kind of like to use the. The Airbrush Just tap a little bit. I think that's a bit better. And we have to move that down so. This is before and after some extra lighting, so depending on the person you might like the first version better. There's different taste. Some people are kind of a first. The look at the layer blending modes give I personally like it and what I usually do is paint over it after that. So if you find that color Dodge or overlay over exposed or something and you can usually paint that out or just paint over it and blend in like with a couple brushstrokes, it's pretty easy to do and there's so there so helpful. So I used them plenty. Steven says, Oh, Is It? And artwork. Is that something for a populist to see? Oh, is this your painting that we painted young Russian woman? What is that in Frisco? The textures are cool though the textures on the body the you can see the paint strokes. Oh, thank you. Thank you Kevin. So I'm going to add a little bit of. Cooler light reflecting on the skin here something a little bit more towards blue blueish white, similar to the color of the wall up here that would make sense. 'cause That's kind of light. Causing this reflection. Of course you can take artistic license and change this stuff, but usually if I'm doing this study then I'm going to try to say pretty close to the reference picture, 'cause I'm trying to learn something from that. I don't want to get too. Crazy. 'cause then I'm just kind of. Then I'm doing something different then that's a personal exploration which is also very good to do. Good for your art. Good for fun, but it's not as much of a study if you are. Just kind of inventing all the. The lighting and everything. Although there could be different things that you're studying, it could be studying. Well, any number of things, but for me I'm focusing on learning about the lighting in the original. So yes, fresco, super cool. Alright, we'll get a little hint of the nostril there. There's like so many variables that are new at one time that it's more difficult, and you kind of really have to stick to the reference like we're saying. But then as you study more and more and you start to like, learn how things work, then you will have more freedom because you don't. You don't have to try to split your focus in so many different ways, there's. A few things that will start becoming like second major. You'll just kind of understand how they work and then you can experiment more. You'll feel the freedom to experiment more so. That will definitely happen. And I still have a lot to learn. I'm definitely feeling at it. As you see the progress and it can be helpful for giving you that push to like. Keep going with it. But it's also just an on going. Journey like we're we're always going to be. You know, even artists that are. Have been doing art and painting for decades and decades I I'm sure they feel the same way too in there. Always learning something new. I'm putting trying to put a little bit of that warm bounce light under the chin. Still not happy with that. But we'll get there bringing the airbrush to soften things a bit. So I'm going to bring the chin out a little bit more. A little bit better, but. Seems to be a little bit more like. Here. Why he flips the study. So I flip it to get a fresh view, flipping it, kind of. And when you been looking at a scene for awhile from one angle, you tend to like. You stop being able to see mistakes as easily and when you flip it, your brain kind of gets a fresh look at it. And you might notice that something is slanted, weird or something like that. Oh, you're welcome Jen. I'm happy that it helps. I've been. Yeah, I know that sometimes I'm flipping a lot, so I apologize if it's ever annoying to watch, but I've become so. Used to doing that and comfortable with doing that. It really really helps me and I sometimes do without even thinking. Hey Andy, good to see you. I'll think you drop. Thanks for being here. You guys, I hope you're having a good day so far. For anybody who's just coming in, I can show you the portrait we did right before this one. Um? This one was about 2 hours. And. The one we're working on right now I'm my goal is to spend about two to three hours on it. It's a bit harder actually, because of the side view. But I'm enjoying it. That random but nice chair haha. Thank you, Yeah, but the cherry have is a Noble chairs. It's the. The Epic Gaming Chair is the name of it. If you wanted to look it up. It's a good chair if you spend a ton of time at your desk and everything. It can be nice to have a supportive chair. I had some really rough chairs before this one. I was happy to upgrade. Oh, thank you Kevin. We're getting we're getting there. We're getting there with the. With the mouth and the. Sachin. That was the. Unexpectedly tricky part. I guess the chin just came out a little further than than I thought. Hi Jane Welcome. So the red of the lipstick and the dress in my image is a little bit more of a like tomato red. The reference is has a little bit more towards magenta almost. I mean it's still red, it's not. But you know what I mean? I think mines Amore towards yellow rather than blue. And I think that's OK. Feels. Feels good, I think. We could huge shift it to be more magenta. But I think I like it. Thank you Stephanie. Yeah, it's been fun to do some portraits again, I was talking about this earlier, but the reason I started I got into doing portraits today. There was a couple of things. One I've had a lot of questions lately. Since I do mostly landscapes, I've had a few questions asking if I would do some portraits. So I had it in mind for awhile, but I wanted to do some and last night I took a little bit of time when I was sketching around with that Sailor Moon redraw meme. That's been going around, but the screen screenshot. Um? Everyone, so it's been going around on Twitter. I think that's where I saw it. People have been repainting a screenshot from one of the old Sailor Moon episodes, and it's cool to see. Like a lot of different style, a lot of different art styles, people doing the same screenshot in different ways. So anyway, I was kind of diddling around with that, and it's the first time that I've been painting a character in quite some time. And then it got me in the mood to paint portraits. so I thought we would do this. But if you guys enjoy this, we can do more often portraits mixed in with the landscape. Maybe we can do some animals. There is a place in my discord where you can suggest topics and reference images of things that you might like to see in the streams. So if you're interested in joining my discord community, there's a link below the stream in the description. And there's a channel in there that's just called suggest topics I think, and you can post in there things that you'd like to see. Yes, Jay and I am I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22 so I have a little. I have a stylist and I'm drawing on the screen. But for anyone who is looking to get into digital painting, there's a lot of. There's a lot of different tablets available. You don't need to go right in and get a screen tablet right off the bat. It's art club open to all. Yes, anybody can join in for our club and do the studies along with us. Art Club is that we're doing in an ongoing study group in the discord as well, where there's a new topic every couple weeks, everyone is welcome to join in on that. Show us all about the Sailor Moon thing I, I promise I will, but it's like. It's not really far enough along. Well, I can show you, but it's like such a work in progress, it's still. It's not what it's what I want to do with it eventually, but. Oh no, that's the. That's the sketch I did here. Let me see if I can open the painting. But I started it and then I was thinking that I actually might try a different style. I don't know. I feel like I want to paint this screenshot and like a couple of different styles. Um? Am I not able to find? Oh here we go. So this is the. This is the screen I can show you the screenshots here, but this is my work in progress. At the moment. So she has this intense expression which I was trying to get, and it's actually really tricky. But this is the screen shot of her. So everyone, a lot of people are getting all this. It's really fun if you guys want to join in draw Sailor Moon. If you Google Sammy and redraw, I think you're going to find it. Oh that's OK. Yeah scenario I don't mind at all. You're doing great. Jane, every Wednesday I'll be here every Wednesday. And thank you project. Good to see you. Yeah, I'm thinking of. So I guess the thing I couldn't decide on with the. The repaint that I was doing is how much of an anime? How much of an anime vibe to take with it? Like do I should I re imagine her more as like a real person? Should I keep the anime eyes like I just couldn't decide what to do with it? Oh is very Val doing more in German? It's not related to it's not related to hers, but that's cool. I would love to see that. Yeah, so Jane, it's every Wednesday an I start. Let's see what time it is. About 3 1/2 hours ago is when I started and yeah it's the same time every week. Really. All thanks you guys. I know this little bit of delay and I'm seeing all your reactions to the Sailor Moon picture right now. OK, maybe I won't restart it then. I was feeling very. I worked on it for awhile last night and you know how when you paint something for a few hours and you're just like not sure what it even looks like anymore. I can't remember exactly how long I spent on that, but I think it was like. Maybe 2 to three hours last night and afterwards. I was just like I don't know. Is it doesn't need more animate less anime. Anyway, thank you so much you guys. I appreciate that. I'll keep going with it then. So currently in art club were studying ears, so I have to do a good job on this. Here you guys I can't cop out on it because that would be ridiculous. That's literally what we're studying right now. I have to do a good ear. This is a perfect example of a portrait where it's worthwhile to spend some time on the year. Claire sees as they once tried to draw a chrollo from Hunter Hunter X Hunter in a realistic way rather than anime found it so difficult it is it is I found the same thing with some video game characters. If the original model of the character is like. Not like a real person. It's more of stylized. It's hard to. Take that into a realistic or semi realistic. It's really tough challenge. Looks like she came to life and is ready to be a superhero. Nice, thank you. That's awesome. Thanks Sarah. Oh cool, I have to check that out, Jennifer. Of the check that I've been really enjoying seeing peoples versions in the different styles. And some of them are a bit funny. Oh my gosh, have you guys seen the silly ones? I mean, I've seen all kinds of stuff. I mean, it's really funny people have put like a shark face like she's a shark. Or like I've seen people draw all kinds of weird stuff just with her hair, basically turning it into Sailor Moon. and I mean, I know I'm easily amused. But it's really funny. I definitely advise appraising the Sailor Moon redraw hashtag for some laughs. And some very good art as well. But definitely less people being silly. I haven't Jane. I haven't used fresco yet. I do think it looks pretty cool. Some of the textures are awesome, but Photoshop is my. Main program. Yeah, I don't know if I improve the ear. Think I will erase out this area up here. I kind of like my first version. See This is why I like to work on a separate layer sometimes. Sadly, you don't always improve. Sometimes, sometimes when you're painting, you make a couple of Brushstrokes. It's kind of taking the painting in the wrong direction. And I really like being able to turn the layer on and off. Be like do I like that and then decide if I want to merge it down? You find Nigel Thornberry. I didn't see that one particular. It was really funny. I didn't see that you saw one with Christine. Always loved routine. How cute. He asking some real silly ones, that's awesome. It's been going on for awhile, I think. Which is cool I have like I was saying earlier, it's been awhile since I've gotten to jump in on one of these memes. They've been a few of the. Sort of come and gone, and I just didn't get a chance to jump in. This one was Sailor Moon so. He couldn't miss it. There you go. OK, I see. Am I going to be scarred? Oh my God. This is what I'm talking about. It's so funny what people are doing OK. Here you go. I hope this brings joy to people, yes. Success. Clever says fresco just got some new features. I saw them yesterday. Can't wait to try blender brushes woo blender brushes. What is that? It sounds like mixer brush. I like the sound of that. Why is it a challenge? Well, I think they're saying challenge just because they're like challenging people to do it. But yeah, I think you're right that the expression is a little bit tough because she's like, it's like she has multiple. Emotions at one time like it's a very cool shot. It's a very cool capture. Like her expression I think is very well done by the animators there. But I think the challenges is just to do it like for example to draw this in your style challenge or whatever. It's just I think the challenge thing is more to do with the fact that their challenging people to do their version of it kind of thing like that's how I how I kind of read it. But I've seen people comment on the expression and when I was working on mine last night, I was like, yeah, this is a tricky one. Not everyone is feeling the need to. Do the expression exactly the way it is in the the reference. Either some people are just doing their own thing kind of putting in a similar pose. So I think it's just for fun, so it's all good. Oh, thank you, yes, and are you. Thank you. The 3D Ness of your Sailor Moon painting reminds me of a great article on Instagram. Wow, cool, thank you Jackson. Maybe maybe you can send me that artist if you think of it. I would like to check out their work maybe firstly inspiration if you can find them. Yeah, half the time I can remember people and then I can't remember their name on socials. I know the rendering is like really good on that natural Thornberry feel like what? OK, so let's take a step back here. As much as I'm enjoying working on the character or the person, the woman I feel like soon I should take a look at these Flowers. Otherwise we're going to end up with. These Nothing going on here by the end and that I do think we need to do something with the Flowers to make this scene feel complete or just take them away and not have her holding Flowers, but we can't leave him out there now. OK, here's another one you guys this is. Thank you. You're a. So this is the one with Pooh Sheen. Oh, not gonna lie, hurt my own feelings drawing that single pier pushy. How cute. OK, those are great. Thanks you guys. I appreciate the links I hadn't seen either of those. So thank you. My day is improved. So I'm going to. I've been saving some of the previous versions as we go through here, so it's kind of cool to see the progression. Almost like the lights got turned on. I I didn't really do that with the previous painting, but. There's always the video. There's always the stream video. We can go back and see it that way. Alright, I'm going to take the Airbrush. I want a little bit more of a rounded look to her neck. Back here, so we're just going to. Do some shading. Trying to pick the right color. I want a darker Brown. Something like that. I would just merge this away. Make a selection here. And we can do the same thing on the red dress too. Like there's a little bit of shading up here. Over here. But we do see like some stitching. The catch is the lights kind of a cool detail. Thank you, fission. Thank you, feels nice to draw people again. Let's put some little wrinkles. So we need a little bit of darker values. Here I'm address in shadow. To make more balanced feeling overall to the shading so like something was missing. There we go. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate that, although the cat version is very good, very good. So some wrinkles. Luckily, the fabric is pretty smooth. My favorite type of fabric to paint on people is. Fairly fitted or clingy fabric with just a little bit of wrinkles, but I think that's the easiest because. And I think it looks nice because you get a nice view of the form of the person's body. And then you know, a little bit of wrinkling here and there, but it's not. I prefer this to like drawing baggy clothes. Something like that is really hard. We did one on this stream awhile back. You could watch the video of it if you go to the my page and look at the past videos, but we painted a girl wearing a big baggy sweatshirt and that sweater I should say and that one was really tough. How to wrinkles? So. This kind of clothing is a little nicer too. The painting. OK, I think it's time to paint some details on the Flowers. So what can we do here? Let's look at the darks and lights first so I want to add some darker shadows in between the groups of Flowers. So there Skype OK. They're kind of clustered together, and so we get some darker greens. This. And she's holding the Flowers close to her body, so there's darker shading on the dress down here too. Just do that. If you guys are hearing a lot of clicking. That is my keyboard. I use the keyboard for shortcuts, and I've reassigned um any of the default. To my left hand, like some of them were already. Just naturally keys that you hit with the left hand, but anything that was. Any shortcuts that were originally on the right side of the keyboard. I've just resigned them all so that I can draw with the Stylus in my right hand and just click the keys in my left hand. There's all different ways to set this stuff up. Some people like to use. Like tablet buttons on the tablet or other kinds of shortcuts, but. I like the keyboard. I feel like it's. When I first started out, I liked the keyboard 'cause I already knew some shortcuts and I didn't have. That was sort of easy to just start using those right away, like for example just using undo, copy, paste, transform things that you might know generally, and so I could start right away using those with the keyboard. And also. The keyboard is mostly going to stay the same, so that's another thing I like using the keyboard shortcuts, I feel like with the tablets sometimes the models will change and they will get rid of buttons or put buttons in different places and stuff and always hated the idea of having to relearn all my shortcuts just because. There was a different type of tablet now. So the keyboard is pretty stable. As far as I don't think they're going to change where the keys are. So if I memorize the keyboard shortcuts, then I'm good to go. Don't have to change them. All right, so we've got some stems for the Flowers. Oh, thank you. You are a. Yeah, so when I first started doing these studies without choosing from the color Picker, I did find it very frustrating and I felt a bit slower at 1st and my colors were often a bit off, but I would say within like two to three months of doing paintings without color picking it started to get a lot easier. I would say for anybody who like feels restricted when I first got into digital painting, I only ever color picked from photos like I never painted without the color Picker. But Yeah, I work through that by doing these studies. Practicing by just looking at the color and so I do. Sometimes, you know, change things a little bit by making mistakes or by like my own preferences coming in. But Thank you. Um, do you have to keep changing color by keyboard? So what you do what you can do is if you have your paintbrush selected like this. Um? If I hold alt, it brings up the color picker, the eyedropper so I can, for example color pic here, like if I'm blending something. This is often how I blend is like. Let's say I want to blend this Brown and the red, so I'll color pic from here and just overlap. And colour pick an overlap in color. Pick an overlap and just do that until you get a gradient like that. Use the buttons on my tablet. Most of the time. Don't know how managed before, right? Just going through the menus every time there's a few, there's a few short cut, but I still need to add to my workflow like there's there's a few things I still do like the long way that I should probably address. But you know how it is you kind of have to take a when you're trying to memorize new shortcuts. It always feels like you have to be slower at first while you're going through the memorization stage. You know it's easier to just go to the menu, you know where it is. You can get it done, but then you're thinking like, oh, what did I sign this? And you have to. It's kind of annoying at first, but it's so worth it. There's a few more I need to start doing that with. Do you ever find yourself using what you know in your head is probably the the wrong color. How to get out of that headspace? Um, trying to think of what usually trips me up with this stuff with color picking. Um? I don't know that I've had that exact kind of feeling. What you're talking about. Usually my problem is like I don't know it's the wrong color. I like think it's the right color, but then some things just feels wrong about it and then, So what I'll usually do is try to paint without color picking. But if something just keeps feeling wrong then I will go and color pic NC like where am I in relationship to the reference? Like for example I know that I didn't get the same color for her dress, but I kind of like this tomato. Read a little bit more. It's like more yellow we read then. Magenta, red, and we're talking about that, so I kind of like it. But let's say I really wanted it to be exactly like this, so I would just go over here and grab it and so what's nice about doing this is you can see where you're off. An maybe helps for the future, so like for me, I'd be curious how. What is the color of this shine here? OK, so we can see where that is and then if we color pic on mine. We can see that minds a bit darker. Anna bit too warm so that I can learn what I did wrong that it needs to be lighter and cooler, less saturated, and so that's what I'll do is if I feel like something just looks wrong or I don't get it, I'll dig, try to get the right color, but if I can't, or if I want to check like check my work, I can do that. But here's one more tip about the colour picking. You see how there's all these like pixelation to the images? I mean when you zoom in, look at this. I mean you can color pic from this area and who knows what you're going to get any of these colors could be the one you get and they are really different from each other. So if you're going to color pic from a photo, you might want to go to filter noise, median, or or any kind of blur filter will work. But I like to use median if I'm going to do this and it really makes it easier to get to color pic and feel like you're getting a representation of that area and not getting a or actually know what someone told me recently. I think this may have been Jackson. Someone told me recently. That you can come on your color Picker. Let's see if you can change the point sample to average pixel, so this will do the same thing, only you don't get the visual of it, but it's doing it anyway I guess. So when your color picking, it's going to take an average of however many pixels you say here 51 pixels, though I guess 51 pixels around your. Where you color pic is going to average those and give you the color. I don't know what that will do on edges. But I guess if you color pic right in the middle of stuff, that should do it. Or go to a smaller average number. But that should also do it, but the point is, you don't want to get these random little pixelated things. And colour, so that's why sometimes color picking is like not as easy as people think either. 'cause you could be coloured picking from photo an getting like really weird stuff from it, not realizing that you picked like off pixel like a weird pixel. Have you been painting digitally for along about Seven years now is when I started. Have you considered adding a posterized layer to reduce the colors? I played with some like layer and filter effects like that just for just for fun. But I guess I'm not a huge fan. Of the aesthetic, like I haven't been able to work anything like that into my style in a way that I like. I think I think for more stylized art that would be really cool, but generally the way I paint I feel like it doesn't work so well. Oh, you're welcome, clearly. ASI We have an art share here. Jackson says my take on this one. I like it better than the first one I did today. Woo, pretty textures. I like your last edges and stuff that is super cool. See if I consume in here. Yeah, I sent some mixer brush use in this. I really like these edges. Very pretty portrait. Like it's a beautiful portrait, but I'm interested in your brushwork. It looks really good. Nicely done that fast too. OK, so. Let me see what time it is 'cause I wanted to take a look in budget. My time finishing this up. Alright, we're doing pretty well. So I should be able to finish this one, but looking at Jackson's painting. It makes me want to take some of these edges and really soften them. I really, really liked what you did. Of course, we're doing a bit of a different style. In our painting, oh, that was the wrong tool. But I do like the idea of letting the edges be a little softer as they are not not close the face, but you know the other around the other edges of painting. Did it mean the post raise layer for the artwork? Not for the aesthetic but for the color picking on the reference? Stephanie, I get what you mean. I probably should have realized that yeah, yeah, yeah, I get what you mean. I haven't tried that. That would probably work too though. That would probably work too, 'cause it would give you a flat area of color to use the color Picker on. So yeah. Lots of mixer brush on the slide. Good stuff. Well, it looks awesome. Oh yeah, I said I was going to paint the Flowers, but I haven't really been doing that. Let's keep going on the Flowers like I start working on the Flowers and I'm like so boring. Let's paint her, but I do like painting Flowers. But I gotta figure out a way to simplify these Flowers because it it seems like a lot of detail. If we really get into it. So let's see what we can do. Want to kind of sort of cluster them up. And focus on the overall shape of the bouquet and. The overall just impression that you get from looking at them. But not so much every single flower. We don't need to render every flower. So I'm looking at overall what the shading looks like on the Flowers as a big group. And then I want to also look at more individual Flowers. So for example, say there's one over here. I went over here in here. Here, here. They have these little darker centers. Here dude, I'm just putting these wherever I want. I mean I'm looking at the reference but not painting all the Flowers exactly where they are in the reference. That would be how we be here long time. Stephanie says it's awesome. You get a slider on the posterize layer that let's you choose the amount of colors you want to have. Pretty neat for building up a pallet off a picture. Thank you for the thank you for the suggestion looking inside, so I think that would probably be super nifty in pixel art stuff too, huh? I like that I'll probably use that if I get stuck. Something. So you guys can probably tell, but this brush is really hard to do detailed things on. It's not really so possible. Hey Janice, How do you render in photo shop? Well, you just take a a blank canvas and I use any of these brushes here. There's default brushes in Photoshop or you can install separate ones and then you just paint on the canvas. You can use layers, there's tons of different things you can use. I don't know if I'm answering the right question when you said render. If you mean something else. Let me know do you mean like save the saving it out and exporting it? But either way I always every Wednesday I'm here. You know streaming my my painting process, my illustrating so you're always welcome to come here and watch the process. and I go through the whole. Picture. All welcome back, Murphy hey, you can always watch the video later if you want. The nice thing about watching the past streams here on Behance is that there's this tool timeline tool which is really neat. This is a plugin that I'm using and it's recording the tools. I'm using the brushes amusing as I'm using it. So, uhm. Yeah I was. Yeah, so you can. See in more detail if it's if it's easier. If it's hard to follow along for any reason, then watching the past streams later can give you more info. Yeah, Yeah, Stephanie, that's what I was thinking about like. I see how you could. How that might be useful. Oh, I'm sorry jasm. Well. There are some things you can do. To help make it easier on your PC, of course, it maybe it's not possible right now. Maybe in the future, but if you are painting and you're having trouble with your computer and the processing, one thing that you can do is paint smaller, smaller resolution. So my image sizes 2000 by 2500 pixels. That's not very big. That's a reasonable size, but you could go smaller than this and still do good studies. Um? Yeah. So. You can use fewer layers like paint in a more traditional kind of method and then you don't have so many layers. That's that's going to, you know, so that's something that you can do if I think of other things. Um? Certain brushes certain tools can be more difficult on your processor too, so there are sometimes things you can do to help with that, but. Yeah, I hope you'll be able to to upgrade so that you can do what you want have. Hey Francesca. Thanks Janice. Oh, thanks, Mirthful. That's really nice to hear. I'm working on the Flowers right now. I know they feel really blurry at the moment. I can't wait to get some sharp details in here, but I'm kind of working my way up to it. Thank you. I hope you guys are having a good day. If anyone is just coming in and you want to take a look at the reference image, you can find a link to it in the description below. The stream. So putting in some where the center of the Flowers. And then I think we're going to. We're going to have to go in with a sharper brush, 'cause I just cannot get more detailed with approaches like. You're asking too much of me. I can't paint that small. OK, so new layer and let's grab this brush called wet paint brush in my brushes pack. And. I'm going to try. Sharpening up that some of the centers of the Flowers and some of the leaves. I'm not really sure what's the best approach. You know, maybe leaves, I mean pedals, but you guys know what I mean, petals? Let's try pedals first. Will try bringing some highlights out from the darker flower. That seems a bit intense. No, I like that. So there's some little stems coming up in between different areas here. It just seems so. I do, I do have Instagram. Let me paste the link in chat. Alright, I'm gonna try something else 'cause I'm not. I'm not getting the flow with these Flowers. I'm going to put a new layer on multiply and work on the overall values here. Maybe I'll use the lasso tool to block off some areas. And try to get some darker shadows. If you look at the reference beautiful photo, there's quite a lot more shadows and the Flowers and what I have and I feel like it's easier to paint something like this dark to light. So starting with things being a little bit darker and then I can go back and add like little individual pedals that have light hitting them. But I feel like it was really tough. what I was trying to do. Hi Ricardo, Banks, thank you. Yeah, we're mixing it up. I will probably do portraits a little bit more often. My guess you guys who are familiar with my work. No. I'm mainly a landscape painter, but I do like to do portraits too and it's been too long so we will try to make some more in. Oh thank you, thanks Hazem, appreciate that. Alright, we're getting there, but it's still a bit muddy, but we're getting there. I'm going to make a new layer and put it on overlay, so I first used multiply layer blending mode to add shadows, multiplies a really good one for shadows. The main one that I use if I want to add shadows and I don't always add shadows on a layer blending mode. I usually use lit layer blending modes when I want to add shadows to something that I've already rendered quite a bit and I don't want to have to like repaint it so it's more like adding a modification to that thing is just darkening it without covering everything. So multiply is good for that overlay I'll use in a similar situation when I want to add saturation. So I don't want to redraw this stuff, but I want to add a little bit of extra. Glow extra colour. So I'll make a new layer, put it on overlay. Maybe do a little trial and error with the colours. See what works, but in this case I'm adding a little bit more of a vibrant warm glow. The before and after. And then I'll make a new layer an. Now we can look at adding the petals, and I can try again with this brush so far. I've been sticking to just a few brushes for these couple of paintings I've done today, an. I don't really want to. I want to avoid. God is spreading out from that. I'm trying to stick with like a minimal brushes for these and I'm hoping that will give them more of a cohesive look, inconsistent style. So I don't really want to fish around for a bunch more brushes. I'm hoping we can make it work with this. But the idea is I want to take what I have here with the flower, just kind of like add some little. Extra finishing touches and then be able to say OK, it's done. Simplifying these Flowers. It's been kind of tricky. But I think that could work. I think the way that one looks is OK. I like the center to be a little bit darker. Alright, I think that is going to work if I can make the other Flowers look like that. I think this will. This will be fine. OK, so I'm going to merge that down. And then we will keep going with this. But we had to do a couple of different attempts, do things in different order to find something that works. Alright, so let's paint some Flowers. I am assuming in a bit here, so I think that'll make things a little easier, but I don't want to zoom in too much, 'cause then I'll start to over do the details on the Flowers. We want them to read well and work well from about well really from full view, but this distance would be good. If I zoom in too much, what's going to happen is the Flowers will get super super detailed, which might look nice, but then we zoom out. It's like it's not going to be cohesive with the rest of the painting is just going to be all about the Flowers then. So. We try to avoid that. So I'm looking at the reference to see on each flower you know it's they're reaching out into the light when they're bunched up there a little bit darker. So whatever that latest highlight is, I'm trying to kind of accentuate that one. Is it really pretty Flowers? But they've got a ton of petals. If anybody is painting along with me. And you're you got to the Flowers. I'm sure you also had that a feeling like what? How many petals are there going to be in this? But it is pretty. And another bit of good news is we don't really have to paint all these Flowers in such detail, just a few, just a few that are more prominent. Like probably this group these three. I'm just holding alt an color picking from what's already there. I'm mostly just using the same colors since I've sort of figured it out from the other Flowers that I've done so far, I can just color pick from those Flowers when I'm painting these, and it's probably for the best because I want him to all look like the same flower. So I don't want to bring in a random color on one of them that I didn't use on the others. Some people would maybe disagree. I've heard the advice about. Not colour picking so much from your own painting 'cause it will eventually feel kind of dull. and I think there's something to that a little bit, but within something like this I think it makes sense to you. Color pic from my own painting and I do it all the time. Color picking from my own painting. I honestly think that it. Once you get enough colors in there, I think that it honestly helps with cohesiveness more than it hurts, but you do want to keep things fresh, so I think the idea is that you want to keep the colours fresh and lively in your painting. So as long as you're doing that. I don't think it's a problem. Well, I'm kind of being at the process here. Maybe we can go in assembly line, flower painting mode. Why all the yellow petals in one go all the Flowers? Now would be the center. You know it would help. Probably looking at this in black and white. I feel like the Flowers have a lot of subtle. Yeah, look at that whole. Check this out guys. Look at the real photo. The Flowers in black and white, and then look at mine. So I need a lot more light areas, but overall the Flowers on the left side or like much darker than the Flowers on the right. So there is a good reason to turn your painting in black-and-white, 'cause sometimes you're surprised. I'm just going to paint in black and white for a little bit. So I showed this at the beginning of stream and I can show it again 'cause I know some of you weren't here that Ben to turn your painting in the black and white like this. You have to. Set it up as a shortcut and then once you've done that, you can just do that anytime. And it's super handy and easy to do. Just pressing CTRL Y. Hey Andy. Howdy, welcome. Let me show you real quick. You guys you can go to view, proof, setup custom and then select device to simulate working grade gain 20% and then press OK. And then anytime you press CTRL Y, you'll get the black and white view and you can paint. In this view you can color picking paint in this view. Anything that you, any colors that you color, pick and use it will be the real colors, not the grey. So that's something that. In whatever other ways that you might desaturate, you don't have the ability to color pick the real colors and paint with them. Like this, so that's why I like to do it this way. But hopefully will get more to the right value range with the Flowers, so we're going to bring the later yellows over here. Sometimes you can be harsh to do those tests, but it's good to find out what's wrong. All thank you, thanks Steven. Thanks Kevin, I appreciate that we're getting there with the. So after I work on the Flowers a little bit more until they feel yeah, the Flowers, they just need to be acceptable. I'd like them to be nice, but they're not the point of the scene, but they need to be like good enough that you're just like, Oh, she's holding some nice Flowers. I don't want them to get the tractor. I like what's going on with those Flowers. So I feel like I was getting for awhile. But yeah, after we work on the Flowers a little bit more and they're like. They're good. Then we're going to work on the hair in the face little bit more. The hair is just like a big block right now, but we're going to add some little shines. A little flyaways. Not much hair is pretty like smoothing and nice, but we can add some little. I mean, I think that it's pretty to have those little fly away things in the ponytail. Um, let's see power versus my conscious mind will always say don't go for too much details. What is not going to show up of my subconscious mind is always pushing for more details of sad. I promise I really understand. It's so hard not to get sucked into doing details. It's really, really tough. But you will get better at that. And like you're saying, but you are conscious of it, that's so huge because not not everyone is, you know it's. I wasn't until a certain point in my. Art education, and I mean our education wise I wasn't even thinking about official education but just online watching tutorials, listening to other artists talk and learning. That way I started getting the idea. OK, I need to be. Need to learn how to simplify things more and not get too into details, and that's hard when it's your natural tendency. But it does get better and like the fact that you're thinking about that and you're working on it, it's going to improve overtime. The more the more you practice. Oh thank you yeah scenario, thank you. So I think something that that I could probably do to improve this is maybe put some more Flowers that are like facing, like different ways in the reference, the. The Flowers are not all perfectly upright, and some of them are kind of scratched up a little bit. And maybe that's a bit more natural. Mine kind of got a bit organized. But that's OK. Speaking of fighting your subconscious, one of my battles is. Not making things to organize like that. Like, especially when you're painting Flowers or. Anything organic you want to let there be imperfections and stuff, and it can be hard to. Oh Janice, that's so sweet. Thank you. So I just did all this work and I'm going through purposely smudge some of it away, but the issue I have here is that. I don't. I think the balance between soft and hard edges is not quite satisfying to me yet. I find there needs to be more. Softness. Maybe I could try using the mixer brush a little bit. So the mixer brush is something that I don't have a full handle on yet, but I think it's fun to dry. It's the icon for the mixer brushes. This paint brush with a little paint drop here. And. Yeah, so we have this brush and all of the. Settings up here are related to the mixer brush and how dry or wet. How much paint is on the brush, how much it's going to mix with what's already on the on, the canvas it supposed to imitate, like a real painter mixing together and stuff like that. So if I if you press alt just like with the clone stamp tool or the color Picker, you press alt and it's going to select from a certain area and you can see up here what it's selecting so I can select this grey part. I can select sure I can select in between two things and then you'll see this kind of thing happening. And then when you paint. It takes that selection and uses that as your paint. What's on your paintbrush? So it's very cool forgetting. Traditional kind of feeling and that might be a cool thing to do here. I could smudge a bit the. Some of the edges with the Flowers. Steven says regarding details. The thing I picked up from photography is to preserve as much detail as possible. You might produce something thinking it would be printed 77 by 5 at 72 DPI. Then the customer wants a 90 inch art prints of 600 DPI. That's a very good point. So what I would say to that is you can still make it a large canvas Ann. Hi, Hi DPI, but you can still paint with larger brushes. In relationship to that and still avoid getting hyper fixated on little things but still make it. But still make it nice for printing, but that's a good point. Thank you Paramo. Just came to mind. Is this the same model we painted for art clips of time ago? I'm not crazy. It's possible because a lot of the photographers that I. Follow on pixels and Unsplash in places like that. I probably used multiple photos from the same photographers before so it could be. I'm not sure if it is. I'm having trouble being able to tell. But it really it's very possible. But yeah, so this is getting in to be a little bit of a different style. If I continue with these kind of brush strokes, but I think it's kind of fun. This a little bit of traditional feeling and you can go over so for the using the mixer brush. I kind of like to use it like what I'm doing here when I already painted something and then going back and adding some fun textures and stuff and going on top. Working in edge is doing things like this. I don't really like to paint from scratch with this brush because I feel like. It works best when you have we already have stuff on the canvas to go from. I don't really like it so much when I'm trying to paint with it from scratch, but I don't. I think maybe. This is more what you're supposed to do with it. I'm not sure I'm egnew to exploring the mixer brush, but you can see is really cool. I'm supposed to be painting Flowers and I'm all over the place, but I hope you guys find the mixer brush interesting. Look you can color pic from this and then look at that. Look at that. Get all these crazy streaky effects. So this mixer brush is going to be included in the new brush pack the time. Making that I'm going to be selling. If anyone's interested, this one that I'm using right now. I have saved this one and if a couple others that I. Came up with better working, nice enough to think it might be good to include. But it's definitely the closest effect that I found in. Photo shop to real paint is very, very cool. It's also fast because you're cloning like multiple colors at one time. So for me to come in and add more shading to the Flowers like this, it's faster. I don't have to. I have multiple colors on my brush at one time. Oh Foster, maybe that is her. Oh, maybe that's The One. I'm trying to see like where else I can use this. I do want to paint some things on her with this too, not just the Flowers and not just her outfits. I want to. It's consistent style. Also we can use this in the background. So maybe a little bit of an interesting touch. To make it with more painting. I kind of like this accidental square I got over here. Oh no. Yeah, that stuff. I feel like until you get involved with the digital. Digital desire and design world and have some experience with DP eyes and file sizes. It can be really confusing. Yeah, a lot of people that aren't involved in that kind of stuff have no idea how sizes and DPI's work. Thank you Jane, thank you. I would suggest about the whole DPI thing to do some Googling. If anyone's listening in and you want to learn more about it. But basically, just to give some basic information. Resolution default web resolution is 72, so if you're making something that's just going to be for Internet use, it's fine to make it at that size. If you think you're going to want to print it out, you might want to make it 300 DPI just in case. 'cause That's going to be the proper resolution for print and then you'll be in the right place right after that and. You want to consider the maximum size you might want to print it out too. So for example. Realistically, regardless of the original resolution, if the painting is big enough pixel wise, you can still make a nice big program. You can still make a nice break print of it. You can change it to be. In the 300 resolution format, and if it's enough pixels, it's going to be fine, but the point is, if you if you know you're going to print it from the start I would. When you're making your image when you're making your file, I would just go to pixels or not pixels in inches or centimeters like whatever you use and put in 300 resolution and then put in the size that you want it to be. Like the size you want to print it out and make it that size from the beginning. You know? And then you don't have any problems later trying to scale it. Let me see so Jackson. Oh, let me take a peek. Let's see, did we find her? No. She has the same eyebrows. I don't know. I don't think it's her. But they have a very similar look. I could be wrong, I could be wrong, that's really tricky one, especially because we're not seeing her about her. Nose is similar to. I don't think so. I don't think it's her, but that's a really tricky one. It could be. Ha, that's tricky. When I signed for magazine rapper some decades back, I just did it 72 DPI without having any idea, no. All that's so sad. I think everyone. I think everyone who is ever gotten involved in digital arts hasn't like gone through that mistake. I don't know anybody who has escaped it. It's like it's just happens to everyone. It's part of learning process. It's like you don't just know this stuff, you know you. There's no you don't born knowing about it. You should learn it at some point and most of most of us are learning that from sadly having experience. Of making something too small or whatever at the beginning. But hey, once you make that mistake, you're not going to forget about it. I say that every once in a while I still have the experience where I paint something. Not thinking I was going to end up liking it so much and like, Oh, it's just a quick sketch. And then later I'm like you know what that kind of like this. I would like to print it and then it's too small. But Um Judy says here's my version where the girl is so disappointed with the rubbish Flowers she's been given. Ah, that's funny. I you know, I, I don't think I would have read her her expression that way if you say so. But now that you mention it. She could be side eyeing the Flowers a little bit. This is a very delicate. I like your color palette. It's very pretty. Also a little bit your own from the reference, but I like that. I like that. Nice, I like the shine on the cheek bone. Very satisfying. Cool, thank you for painting with me. I really I really enjoy seeing. Different. Different art styles. Trying out the references. And yeah, it's just nice to have have some company while doing studies and things. It makes it go little, go along a little easier. So right now I'm adding some little stray hairs and Flyaways and things to the to the top of the head. I have to be careful because I really wanted to still look like her proper head shape. One thing that I used to do so I can, I guess I could share this mistake with you guys. Maybe you will avoid doing this in your work, but one thing that I used to do was get so carried away with like I'm going to give her all these fun little WAVY things and I would get so carried away with all these loose WAVY. Designs, but it would. I would lose the head shape eventually. You know what I mean and then it would start to what kind of a natural and I wouldn't know why it is because we can't. You still want to get you still want to be able to tell the shape of her head you want to add little things but not go totally wild. I mean, unless you do want to go totally while that's sometimes you drive someone with crazy hair and that's cool. But generally it's more flattering if you can still tell the head shape somewhere in there. At least on part of the head, you know, like she could have her hair could be going out, totally getting her hair could be doing whatever it wants, but you've got to have. Part of it like tight to the head somewhere it kind of helps if you have like. Anyway, this is sort of a generalization, but I noticed it sometimes when I would try to add crazy curls and waves. My layers, including my blending modes. Totally ruined my peace. I had to do it all again. Almost missed the deadline. Once I wanted advanced Photoshop magazine competition, they asked for the work to be sent to them, but actually planned it all. Oh man. Holy cow, well congratulations, but that's super stressful. Oh man. Well, thanks Judy. Crazy says the hair of mine is just getting all quiz like she's looking like 50,000 life. Ha ha ha. I like Flyaways. I think they give a lot of. Like spirit and. Liveliness to the hair if your stylizing, of course, you don't need to go in that direction, but I like adding like little little hairs and stuff lying around. Let's see I have not used Photoshop to paint before, could be quick enough to follow you next time though I paint manually. Um, so when you say manually, do you mean like with a mouse? Or do you mean? Um? Let me know what you mean by that, but. I do try to explain what I'm doing as I go and go at A. Um? Hopefully a rate of speed that you can follow along as far as like understanding and learning, but I don't know if you're just starting out. If you'd be able to follow along, live an like paint along in real time I say this because when I was first starting out I had to you have to learn first like where things in menus are and how to do stuff. And sometimes that kind of thing can slow you up. In you know in following something in real time what I used to do was follow some tutorials on YouTube because then I would be able to pause and restart the tutorial whenever I wanted to an I ended up having to do that and like rewatch some of 'em and just re watch parts that confuse me and kind of do that. That sort of thing. Stopping and starting it as needed so. You're definitely welcomed. I would love if you join us, but I don't want you to be discouraged if it's not possible to follow along in real time. If you're just starting out 'cause there would be, it would probably be pretty difficult, but what you can do is if you go to my page here, if you go to my profile here on the hands and go to the videos tab, you can watch any of my past videos at any time. Going back to. I mean it's almost is getting a few months away from a year now. I think August maybe was when I had my first dream is from here, so there's lots of videos going all the way back and there's this cool thing that be hands have the tool timeline. So this is capturing the tool that I'm using as I'm using it and it doesn't show when I'm live, but if you're watching the replay it will show that that's also something that's like easier to follow along in the replay and then you can pause and start the video again at anytime, so that's probably what I would suggest if you want to really follow along. Oh, you paint oil? That's awesome. Well then that's different. That's different then then. That's probably a It's probably fine. I guess that's then just up to how fast, like what you're painting speed is, you know. I don't have a lot of experience in an oil, sadly, but I'm not sure that would depend. I guess I usually spend about two 2 1/2 hours per painting an I usually stream for about 5 hours. Um, somewhere in the four to six range we usually right at five hours is way what I do on Wednesdays so. Um? I would say. Got your welcome to try an if it's too fast then you could. You could always do the follow along in the videos. It is the same girl. Her name is Alejandra that is like a perfect name for her I think especially with this red dress. I don't know, it just feels right. Nice Jackson, well that's awesome, I'm impressed. For some reason I don't know if it's the lipsticks, but through me or just the profile view, but I wasn't. You know, when I started to think you might have been right with her nose. But I just I just wasn't enough. Yeah, were seen it. That's cool. Also Jane, Let me give you another link. This is a lot of stuff, so feel free to just skim through and cherry pick what you like, but I've been collecting tutorials and resources and things that helped me out over the. Over the years. So I just posted in the chat the link to that. It's like a list of tutorials and things, so if you wanted to peruse through there, there's some. There's free tutorials, things on YouTube, there's tutorials you can buy. All kinds of stuff. I know project isn't it absolutely crazy like it's hard to believe. And thanks for being here since the beginning. It's very cool. Yeah, it's nice that the videos. Are available for so long like the past, the streams from the videos from past streams, even from way back then are available, so there's like tons of. Tons of streams that catch up on if you're looking to. Join in with this kind of thing and I always share my reference and I shared them. I think you can access all those files after the fact, so if you wanted to like watch any of the past streams and try to paint along during those, then the reference files should be there. So I'm trying to get her. Eyebrow Shaper, right? It's a little tricky. I think maybe I. Her eyebrows, little closer down and they should be. I'm not sure I'm just going to keep going. Yeah, she is a very pretty nose though. Stephanie says, I've been wondering what is the next big thing you like to achieve in your art career? Like another level and thing you work towards to one day say I did it. Oh There is nothing that immediately comes to mind. I hope it's not disappointing. Some people have a particular goal concrete goal like they want to work for a certain company or they want to. I don't know make a book or something like that for me. I just want to. I want to keep working on my painting skills and I want to get better at teaching too, like I think that's almost a separate skill from painting an I wanted. Do more tutorials in the future, maybe In addition to an separate from live streaming, as much as I love streaming, sometimes it's hard to explain something in a very, very step by step manner on stream, because there can be all kinds of little interruptions and things like we might start talking about something random, something else. So then it's like harder to go in exact order, so I would like to do some more, make more tutorials In addition to being alive an. I don't know. I don't know about specific goals, but I just want to keep working on my art and my ability to share with others. Process and teaching things and share inspiration. and I guess I'm kind of exploring like how that's possible via the Internet. There's lots of different ways streaming. I think for me streaming in recorded tutorials probably make the most sense. I know some people do books, write books and do that kind of thing, but I've never. I've always found that through videos are it's easier for me to learn, so that's kind of the content that I'm more interested in making. Books are good too, but everyone learns in different ways and I found books not as helpful for me as videos. Hey sing. Thank you, I'll we're doing good. We're painting the. We're keeping people today. Ladies, I should say yeah we're doing. Maybe will do some purchase of guys in the future too. I tend to prefer painting women so I'm not as good at painting guys 'cause I get less practice. So we should do some of that too, but here were the two paintings that I did today. Pretty different vives. But that's what we've been working on. Oh no, that's OK, Stephanie. I just. I kinda wish there was like something some big thing, but I think maybe I'll find that you know what I mean. Maybe it will become more obvious I guess. I'm really happy being doing what I get to do now. I'm being an independent artist so I want to just. Keep doing that and exploring where it takes me and how I can. Yeah, move along with teaching on line and knowledge sharing, exploring art techniques and stuff like that. Thank you clears that you know what I think you just found my. You know what I would love that so I didn't think of it off the top of my head. But I guess that would be a good goal for me as someone who wants to continue teaching. And yeah, something like that would be really cool to do in the future. When they will meditate. Sci-fi, hum. We could just put like a helmet on her and call it sci-fi like shoes. She's in space. Do a little. Do. There you go. I did sci-fi. Although there's a few problems with this outfit, she's not quite covered. She's not quite sealed in move to do something like this. There we go. But thank you, Stephanie. When they will make it right. Oil painting maybe maybe. Someday. I've got too many mediums at the moment, but. I would like to someday. Really like the dreamlike quality of light in the first one at thank you, I really love that. The photo for that reason. Yeah, I prefer like if I'm going to pick my favorite type of images to paint from or scenarios paint from with this in real life is. Any type of setting was a big splash of light. I think it just looks like a lot of Drama and it's really pretty. And it helps was showing form really well. Yeah. Would you make a package and sell it on you'd? Me like tutorial on different categories, landscape, portrait, etc. Yeah, I would consider that I would most likely probably just sell it through a personal website or maybe gumroad or something like that, but yeah. Helmet go sci-fi. Maybe the Flowers are from her robot lover. Oh my gosh, crazy, you're right, that's so cute. I slept a little. Only on the Flowers. So silly. Yeah, I need to make an alternate version of this. Christmas ready for outer space. Sometimes we do the before and after and I'm just like that get better or not I don't know. I her mouth is like. Very different from the reference what I've done. It's ended up giving her a different. Expression and I. I don't dislike it, but I'm going to try getting a little closer to the reference and see if I prefer that. If not I might leave it as is. Like it's kind of like she's. I don't know. I've given her. I almost like a more of A. She's more upset in mine or something. By project, thanks for hanging out. I hope you have a good rest of your day. See you later. Well I like to explain what I'm doing as I go through, but I'm at this stage of the painting where there's there's not like anything. Very big happening. It's like tiny little tweaks. I'm just looking around the painting to see what might be able to improve, testing little details, trying little things out. And usually at this point I just kind of. Move around the painting based on what catches my eye like. What is, if anything, is distracting me in a bad way. If anything catches my eye and I'm like, why don't like that? I'll go there and start working on that area to try to fix it. 'cause I don't want any of the parts of the painting distracting me in a negative way. I want to be able to like look at the painting in a relaxed way. Feel like it's working. So that's usually when I feel like it's a done when I feel like a painting is done is when I stop having that feeling of like what's wrong here. What's wrong here and like going around the painting looking for little things to fix when I finally feel like I could just look at the painting and kind of be a piece. and I know for some people that feeling comes a little bit more. Like slowly or it's more difficult to feel that I'm I'm lucky 'cause I feel like it usually. At some point I do feel like. I've reached at least the Level. I'm happy enough with it. You know, I feel like some artists say there. There they feel like a piece is never done and they just kind of abandoned it. I understand that feeling too. Sometimes I get that, but a lot of times I feel like I do reach a place where I'm like Alright. Well, that's enough for this one or I feel like at my current skill level, this is the best I'm going to do with this one and just end it and keep trying on the next one and. It took me awhile to get to that place because I used to. Sort of work and rework areas were very frustrated manner. But Original picture is a bit more chin and a little less under her lower lip. Yeah, her chin was, yeah oh I see that I see that yeah her chin proportions have been a struggle for me the whole time and see if I can fit that. Red Oh, welcome back my goal, thank you. Thank you were working around here trying to. Figure out some little things with the chin. I think I do think it's better. Thank you, Foster. Sometimes you also need a fresh look. I might take a little break after stream and then come back for this after stepping away from the computer for a little bit. And maybe you know I see something different then. Sometimes that's true. You just need a little bit of a break. But this was fine. Thank you guys for being so like excited about doing portraits. I really enjoyed it. We're going to go for a little bit longer, but we're nearing the end so I'm just going to try to Polish it up and go through some finishing things. Thank you you are a. I'm happy you think so. I think the mixer brush came in and really helped out with that. Her ear has a little bit more like lightness and saturation than what I have done, so I'm going to try to bring in this lick lighter orange color. Just around the edge you'll see in the reference to the warm color to her skin. Just as a little bit more lights to it. So if anybody was painting along for this one, and you do want to share before the end of stream. I would say maybe this is a time to upload your work or upload like a work in progress. I don't want to like rush you and through ending your painting instantly, but if you do want to share wherever your at with this one before we end, I would say. This is a good time to start uploading it somewhere so that you can post it in the chat room quick before before we head off for the day. Oh, by tax and thank you so much for painting with me. I enjoyed your 3D artworks. And thank you for the next comments about my pay days. Think faster. I still need to fix a couple little anatomy things with the ear. I can't per skip out on it. Kevin says, do you ever get halfway through a painting and discover a new style and think oh, that looks good. I think I'll finish there even though it's not where you intended it to end. Yeah, I've had all sorts of things like that happen. You know one thing that's also happened, especially at the beginning when I was first getting into digital painting is I would you know, you're learning a lot in a short time 'cause everything is new, so you're learning all the tools and everything and I would have quite a few circumstances where. Uhm, I would start with a painting and by the halfway through or or somewhere around there I would be like Oh my gosh I would have done this so differently just based on everything you learn during the process of doing that one painting I would think Oh my gosh, I would have started this so differently if I was going to restart it and it sometimes it gets the point where you're just like you know what. I'm just going to call it done here and just apply what I learned to the next one because it's too hard to kind of try to save this and I'm realizing now that. I did some fundamental things wrong at the beginning kind of thing, so I had a lot of unfinished paintings when I very first got into digital 'cause I was just learning so much and I was. It was hard by the end of a painting to finish it, 'cause I would be like, Oh, you know what I now I know how to do it. I'm just going to do it differently now and so I would just kind of move along. I've left unfinished ones from the early days, but it does get a little easier with that whole thing. But randomly, yeah, you know I don't finish all the. Well, when I say don't finish, I don't finish to a quality that I would publish online at everything that I do like I do a lot of studies that I just say OK, well there was an hour. There was two hours. I learned something I don't really love it, but I learned something and I'll get to apply that knowledge in future projects. And I'm just going to call this one done, you know, not every artwork that I do is something that I want to. Publish and share and look at forever. You know, sometimes we just do something for the experience of doing it. I don't always even save the paintings that I make like sometimes, especially in evenings. If I'm just going to do like a little sketch, sometimes they just open Photoshop and it kind of paint. This is when I sometimes just paying from my head to like almost always when I study, I use reference and when I'm even more in personal work, I'll gather references to get the best results. But sometimes I'll just doodle around without reference and sometimes they don't even save those files. I just kind of come in here, paint random stuff, and then just like close it. Ann It's just I don't know. It's just too totally relaxed. And just enjoy the experience of painting and not worry one bit about. Saving it or needing to share it or making anything that's. You know? Presentable in any specific way is just about messing around. Sometimes it's fun to do that. As the same idea with like drawing with sidewalk chalk or something like that, it's like sometimes it's fun to just make an art even if it's going to get washed away with the rain and. And that's all that it was. Was just having some fun making it, doing a little sketch. Gareth says I really relate to that. Sometimes I can really psych myself out thinking it has to be good enough to post before I even start. Yeah, I know. I know that feeling that's when I started doing these time studies. Then I kind of like let myself relax from that a bit and I was like look, this is just a study you don't need to post it, just do it for yourself. An overtime after a while of doing those. Then I ended up slowly finding ones that I liked enough to share and I shared a bunch of the studies that I do on Instagram, but I don't share all of them. Today I'm sure you guys remember once that I've worked on that haven't shown up on line. I don't post all of them, but it's nice to not have that pressure in mind when you're starting something you know. And just if it comes out great, you can share it, but don't feel like you have to. Claire, she says not quite finished, but happy. I'm at least getting faster. Clearly that is amazing. You are getting a lot faster. Nice colours, Yeah. The pallet is nice. I like the motion in the hair. Nice twist. Very pretty the wrinkles. The little huge shifts from yellow to like Pinkish on the skin. That's awesome, clearly I'm really happy for you. You're having a very good period of growth of your art right now. It's very. It's very exciting to see. Yeah, if anybody was painting along and you want to share work in progress, feel free to, but don't feel. Pressure to if you don't feel it's ready, you can always post on social media and tag me if you want to share it later. And you can also share in my discord. I can post the link to discord in my in the chat right now. Both that there's also a link below in the stream description that you can find. Bye Ryan. Have a good rest of your day. Sounds good, take care. Yeah, for anybody that came in during the second painting of the day, I'll show you what we did I think I'm going to be ending my painting here now. I think it's possible I'll come back and do more with this, but probably after a bit of a break. But honestly, even if I had to be done here, I can get the. I don't know. I'm happy I'm happy enough with it, but I might. I might try to sort something more things out with like the. The mouth later. But he was our first painting of the day. It's cool how different the color schemes are. This ones all like cyan, magenta, warm Browns. Much more loose. This one's a bit more. A Titan like these. Oranges, yellows, Reds, totally different mood. That's kind of cool. Yeah. So that was the stream we've been live nearing five hours. So thank you so much everyone who is here. It was really nice. I appreciate the company and all the good conversation. But art and portraits and all the things. So if you guys want to share your work like I was saying, if anybody didn't get a chance to share during stream, just post and share it with me whenever. Or you can share it during the next stream. I'll be here again next Wednesday. I'm here every Wednesday at 12 noon. My time which is. 6:00 AM East Coast. I know that's a bit early, but we do stream for awhile, so if we can pop in whenever it's possible for those of you who are in different time zones. Thank you. Well thanks Ricardo Janice thanks everyone. If you guys have any any questions we can we say from from next stream or pop in the discord? We've got a good art community in their sharing art and inspiration, tutorials and things like that. Thanks, Crazy Foster. Thank you Kevin. Fishing, I appreciate it. Seriously love that first one. Thank you, I will. I will post these I think. Yeah, so you guys can find my Instagram below stream in description. I'll be posting these on Instagram and or on be. Hence I usually just post my more polished stuff here, but maybe I'll add these 'cause I do like them. Thank you you are a. Finished mine, let me post it OK right? Yeah yeah yeah we'll wait for red. I'll just, I'll just stall for a couple minutes. First one is super dreamy for share your love it. Thank you. I wonder you know. I would have liked to have gotten a similar vibe to the second one, but I honestly find it more difficult to paint. Um, loosely, like I feel like the lighting in this made it easier for me to paint. This way. I don't know why, but it just felt natural to paint that way because I feel like light sometimes naturally distorts things when there's like a glow. But when it comes to something like this, the light was so everything was very clean in the actual photo and it was harder for me too. To paint loosely, so I don't know, maybe that's an experiment for next time. Thank you Andrew. Thanks Gene Jennifer. Wow, thank you Michael. That's amazing, thank you so much for hanging out with us and I'm happy to hear that. Thank you yes and Ari. Thanks you guys well. I'm just going to hang out until we can see Reds pink thing out there. We go, perfect timing quickly. Thank you read that was that was fast, no worries. OK, we're going to check this out how pretty, I'm really glad we waited for this. That is beautiful. Yeah, the the shading. The values are really good. You can just feel that lighting I. I feel like you made the lighting more. Almost like more intense or more sunny than the reference, I really like that the cloth. The way that looks that texture. Super cool. Well, I hope you're feeling happy with this one red. I know your other portraits. You worked on the other day you were like not feeling so good. This is really nice. Yeah, you should be happy. I hope you're happy. Look at the hair, you can feel the curve of the head here. The shine of the hair. All the shiny parts are so satisfying. Yeah, very, very nice. Yeah. Alright, well I hope I'm not cutting off too early before anyone else wants to share, but you can share in the discord or in social media or next week. On Wednesday, I'll be happy to check it out then, but that's it for now. You guys stay safe. They carry yourself. Thanks for the company. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. And yeah, I will see you again soon.

Good afternoon, good evening, welcome whatever time it is for you. Thanks for being here. I hope you're having a good day so far. We are going to do some landscape painting today. I just wanted to honestly just wanted to do some fun comfort zone kind of painting. I love this kind of landscape environment. I thought it be nice to take a day and just to do something like that. We do a lot of studies here and a lot of times trying to push outside our comfort zone and try new things. And yeah, it's also good to have those days where you relax and paint something you really really love. So I know we all have different tastes. I don't know if this is. Everyone's favorite type of topic, but I hope you'll enjoy landscape painting today. This is a nice Canyon scene with like a River and trees and foliage around the outside. High-tech girl, how are you? Can you hear me? I hope the audio is working but welcome. So we might have time to do 2 paintings today. I'm kind of hoping for that, but we'll see how things go. I have a couple of other landscape photos set aside depending on what we have time for, so. Yeah, we're going to start with this one. Hey Brad, it dreamt about cupcakes. Oh my gosh, did you get to eat them in your dream? I hope so. I hope so. OK good good tech girl. Thank you. Just checking just checking. So if you guys want to paint with me, if you like the reference image and you're interested in doing a study with me, you can find the link below. The stream in the description there's a link to the original photograph posted by the photographer on Unsplash, and the reference can also be found above the chat. There's an info tab. You can also get it there. Hi Michael, Hi Owen, thank you. Thank you thank you. Hey Mandy. Welcome everybody, yeah yeah tech girl, you can definitely share the sketch in chat. That's totally fine, so I'm going to make a new canvas. We're going to put the I'm going to put my reference over here on the other monitor next to chat so I can see you guys and see the picture. And we'll use pure ref to hold a little thumbnail. View up here. So that should be good. And let's see what size are canvases so the size of the reference image was 1351 by 9:01. That's not very big. I'd like to work a little bit larger just because I really like this scene. Maybe if it comes out great, I'll want to make a print of it or something like that so we can be. It might be a little optimistic, but hey, why not? So let's go 4000. Actually, maybe? Maybe not. That much will go 3003 thousand. Pixels by 2000 pixels that this is really not a great size for making a print. Let's see if we go to inches. Put this at 300 DPI really. You want to take into account. If you want to make it a print, if you know ahead of time you want to make it a parent, you probably should work in 300 resolution. So let's do. Yeah, let's do 4000 by 2300. That should be enough. If we do want to make like a small print. And let me say this and then we will begin. So that's my size. About 4000 by 2000 pixels. If anybody's interested, I get that question a lot. So let's see this and then will begin. I baked them but don't eat them all. Alright, let me see this. Let's check out tech girls working on real quick before we start. All this is very cute. Did you create this character or is this like an already existing character? This is a sketch from tech girl in the chat. Um? Sketch for his upcoming Commission. Well, best of luck with that. And thanks for sharing the work in progress. OK, so we're going to get started. I'm going to explain my process as we go through the painting, and if you guys have any questions let me know. But I will talk about what I'm doing. Here. Hi Anthony, Welcome I can read you in the chat. OK, so. We're going to start with landscapes. I like to work back to front, but most of the time I like to start with a little bit of a sketch. So let's at least sketch stuff in and then will begin with the painting going from Sky and then closer closer and closer to us. So I like to start with figuring out roughly where the horizon line is. I think for this composition were looking at basically the bottom third of the canvas. Maybe I made that too high, but we can move things around easily in photo shop, so I like to put the horizon line on its own layer like this, and then make a new one to paint everything on top of. Or sketch everything on top of it. Because you know, in case you put something in front and you want to move that around, it's a lot easier to not have to erase around that original line. So I like to keep that line on its own layer, and then we go on top. So we've got some. I'm going to try to focus on big shape, so this isn't going to be a very fancy looking sketch, it's just trying to figure out shapes and where things are going to go. So look at the shape of the water trying to break this down into the basic basic form that I see here. Hi Brock, welcome. Got the River coming towards us, then the side. This kind of rocky. Area here and then. On top of that, we've got some nice fluffy foliage. And again, these are really, really rough sketch, but just to think about where things are going to go. And then we will really figure out the shapes in the painting phase. Get into making things look nice. I think my sketches often look like cartoons, which is kind of funny. Hi Amy. Well, good luck. Take girl. He was or a welcome. Hope your day is going well. Hey Machiavelli, good to see you all. Thanks for coming over. We're painting a desert scene to start off with today. If we have the time will do another landscape after this one, but. Yeah, I love these colors. And I thought I'd be nice to do something to some pretty relaxing landscapes today. So we've got these mountains in the back. Trying to keep them roughly in proportion. And then on a new layer. So, so here's something as I go. Sometimes I will erase out, like for example, if we don't need the horizon line behind here anymore and merge what we have. Then if you are, if you lower the opacity on this, it's a little easier to draw on top of it. So for example if I want to draw this tree now over here, if I lower the opacity of that sketch, that portion of the sketch, it makes it a little bit easier for me to see what I'm doing, so I don't know about you guys, but I find it kind of confusing when I've all the dark lines and I'm trying to draw on top of it. So a lower the opacity of the background and then we can paint this tree or sketch this tree and I can see what I'm doing. My day is great so far. You know why I don't wait what happened. I am very happy to hear good news so please fill me in. I've almost finished putting together My Portfolio to go to art school. Whoa, that's exciting. That's super exciting regularly, Congrats. Hi Kenny, think what day is today? Oh it's April 1st right has something to do with that. It has something to do with that, right? I almost forgot today is April Fools Day. Oh Man, I always people always get me I always forget. At home, San help says, should I start choosing photo shop over illustrator? It's your birthday today. Oh my God, I didn't remember or no I I don't think I knew that that April 1st is your birthday or I didn't remember it. I'm sorry about that. That's the case, but Happy Birthday Missouri. I wish I could give you a big hug, but you know, give you an Internet hug. I hope you have a great birthday. Hope you get to do something nice for yourself today. About 7 cups question. It depends on what kind of Art you want to do or what kind of design you want to do. What are you looking to do? Do you want to do a digital painting, digital art, or do you want to do graphic design? Tell me a little bit more about what kind of Art you want to do. Because if you want to do painting, digital painting, then photo shop is a good option. I think the best option. But if you want to do graphic design web design stuff like that illustrator then both will be handy. But in that case illustrator might be more handy. Um? Hi Roger, welcome, thank you. Thank you, I hope you're doing well. Happy birthday virtual hugs. Yeah all that's so nice Missouri, that's a great idea. I'm glad you guys are doing that. Webcam party my sister and my mom were having a little webcam party the other day. Nice. All right, so we've got that reshape here. And now we can bring back the rest of the background now. Do a higher opacity. And I think I might merge those layers together. OK, so. We've got. Our composition here. I think this is roughly what I want. So will start painting. I'm going to put the layer on, multiply, lower the opacity. That way I can. See through the layer more easily and I will lock the layer so that I don't accidentally paint on it. Let me turn the Opacity down a little bit more. That's good. Will lock the layer so this is just this. Sketch is just as a guide for me. I'm going to be painting underneath of it and eventually the sketch won't be needed anymore. So I like to start with the Sky when it comes to landscape because it's the furthest furthest away it. Usually it takes up a large portion of the. Um, the painting and it's also sets the whole mood for the scene, the Sky, the light from the Sky, whatever time of day it is whatever type of whether it is that's going to affect the whole mood of the scene and how colors work in the whole rest of the painting. So starting off with the Sky is a good way to start getting feeling for that stuff. So. Gonna paint nice purple background, I'll just paint everything purple. This can serve kind of his underpainting for the rest of the rest of the scene. Spending my birthday, watching you, drawing some peaceful landscape while playing Animal Crossing, living a dream that sounds very relaxing. I'm glad to hear that I'm glad to hear that Missouri sounds nice. Hope you enjoy. So I'm trying to get the right color here. I'm not color picking from the reference, so it takes me some time to trial and error to get the right color, but I'm using the airbrush to create a gradient from the top of the Sky down. So we're going more and more towards this. Whatever this color is like white, almost. All the way down at the horizon so. A nice gradient. OK, I'm going to merge that down. So basically we have this now is our background and sketch on top of that. And then we'll make a new layer in between those two and that's where we'll start with like the furthest mountain. Then the closer mountain, and then probably the foliage and the water. Ajax and welcome. Welcome welcome, I hope you're doing good today where painting. We're starting with this desert Canyon and River landscape and maybe we'll do another landscape after this depending on time, but I really like this scene. This is like this is a great combination for me because as you guys know I love painting canyons. I like the colors, those warm colors and then the Purples. And. We're going to get a chance to use do do that and then also have a bunch of foliage so it's like all my favorite things. Hi Allie, welcome. I am using a tablet. I have a Wakame Centriq 22 is the model that I have so I'm using the stylus right on the screen. But there's a tons of different types of tablets out there. If you're looking to get into digital art for the first time. I would recommend maybe something. There are tablets like into a style tablets from welcome that are a little bit less less expensive to 1st jump in, but let me give real quick a link. In the chat, just in case it's helpful. Actually I have this link is below in the stream description as well. There's a link to a resources page with a lot of information, but beyond that I want to share specific link from that. That group of resources. This is a blog that does a lot of really nice. Tablet reviews of tons of different types of tablets, different brands, different styles of tablet. So check that out. If you're looking to get in at 2 digital art and looking to get a tablet for first time, there's so many it's really hard for me to give advice on the best tablet for you, because for each person their budget is very different than there can be a lot of little things that can affect which one is probably the best for you, but you'll be able to find it there. I think if you read through, yeah, no problem. Your welcome Pilar. Ellie Barack yeah, no problem. If you have any specific questions, maybe I can help, but I haven't used a ton of different tablets so I haven't tried them all myself. OK, so we're going to start with blocking things in now there's a couple of different ways to do this, so if you're going for speed. You can. You can choose to make selections rather than painting with A paintbrush. That's like a really, really fast way to do this. You can make a selection tracing over your sketch of the area you want to paint in. Like for example, this mountain in the background. You can select that whole thing and then take a color pick whatever color you want, and you can kind of fill that in, and that's a very, very quick way to paint that in, but I think I might use brushes because the style I'm going for it isn't going to be so clean it's going to be more like. Like a traditional painting kind of look. Ah thanks you guys Rosa Manish. Good to have you here if you guys have any questions let me know. So instead of using the lasso tool, which I often use when I'm trying to paint quick, I think I am going to just take my actual paint brush and paint right on here to begin the painting rather than the selection. So we'll see how that goes. I want to show a tool really quick that I use often that you might find interesting. Maybe, maybe not, but it's called underbrush settings. It's called color dynamics. I'm a big fan of this, and basically what color dynamics does if you go to your brush palette. If you click this, if you look at the settings, there are settings of Hue, saturation and brightness jitter, so there's two. Well, there's a couple ways that I use this, so for example, let me turn this up more so it's more obvious when you make your brush stroke. Every time that it creates a stamp of your brush, it's going to slightly alter the color based on the Hue, saturation and brightness jitter here. So you can make it a lot less dramatic. You can make it something like this. It's like barely noticeable, but it's still there. The striping is still there, and this is kind of cool 'cause it gives a lot of little Hue variations and your painting, and it can look like more like traditional oil painting with all those all these tiny little Hue shifts. There's a lot of ways to use this, but. Instead of having it applied per tip, you can uncheck this. And then as you paint, it's going to still apply this variation here. But instead of applying it for each stamp of the brush, each brush stroke that you make is going to apply the different colour. So this is kind of a way to give a little bit of a quick variation to your painting without actually having to change the color every brushstroke, so it can be useful in situations like this. If you look at how this mountain looks in the background. You know, if I were to come here and just start painting it, making these brush strokes if I have the color dynamics and apply for tipper tip unchecked then every brushstroke that I make here it's giving a slight alteration to the color so it kind of with me doing a little bit less work. It kind of makes it look more painterly and like I've done more work here like a little bit of an impressionist kind of look to the painting so that's an interesting thing that I didn't know about for a long time that I recently have become obsessed with. Hi Martin, welcome, thanks for being here Windsor. I'm doing good thanks. Hi Anet welcome welcome welcome, good to see you all. Yeah, if you have any questions let me know, but I'm going to explain my process as we go through here so the early stages of the painting are always going to be. The Mecias Tan in my opinion, also potentially the most confusing because until you get everything blocked in in at least a basic way, it's a little. It's kind of confusing to take in the whole painting that's part of the reason I like to get rid of the whitespace as soon as possible, and so that's why I kind of went with the Sky color and just covered the whole background with it. If you turn the painting into black-and-white, you'll see that gives like a Gray look to the whole canvas. This is just the value range, the level of light to dark. The background is more in the in the middle range is actually still pretty late. I color pic. It's actually later than I thought, but the idea is it's not pure white. Background isn't pure white and it's a little bit easier to pick your colors when you don't have a pure white. It's a little bit easier to do the shading and things like that, so so we're painting now. Just trying to block in the basic shapes of the Canyon Mountains in the background and I'm leaving color dynamics on the brush so it's. Choosing all these crazy colors for me, which is kind of fun. I'm going to go on top of this later and sort of rain it in a little bit and put the brush. Put some of these colors more like pick them more precisely myself, but it gives such a nice. First step. Oh thanks thanks Missouri. Yeah, it's one thing that I like about using the color dynamics is it brings a little bit of like happy accidents into your work. A lot of times with digital you have a little bit in my opinion 'cause I do traditional and digital an in digital in a lot of ways you have more control over what you're doing and you can fix mistakes more easily than in a lot of traditional mediums. So you have a lot of control, but sometimes the negative to that is that. You get less of those happy accidents like things that you don't expect to happen when you're painting that kind of turn out cool so color dynamics is one way to introduce these. Like little unexpected surprises into your painting, because it sort of puts some. Colors into the work that you might not expect and things like that. I also like playing with adjustment layers and things like that for the same reason is sometimes you get unexpected things happening that I can. You can find something that you like that you didn't think about before. Hey Carl, thank you. Makes the initial block in less flat. That's so true. That's so true. I would always blocking with flat colors and it it's hard to start to see the life in it. You have to paint for quite awhile. So this is a way to kind of feel like you can move along that a little bit more easily. So what I'm doing right now is painting in the foreground here on these rocks on the side of the River, painting those, and there are a lot more muted in color less. Less vibrant than the background, which is getting that really bright light hitting it, so I definitely want that contrast because I really want the background to like pop out and be really bright and vibrant. So if we keep this pretty desaturated relatively then that will help the contrast between those to stand out more. So I'm going to try to be reserved even though I like bright colors. The colour dynamics are really does make it look like a real painting that's so cool I think so too. Oh, thank you is fine. Thank you very much for being here and thanks for the nice comments. Again, if anybody likes the reference image an you'd like to paint with me, you're welcome to take the image. It's below in the stream description or also in the info panel. You can above the chat, you can find the link to the reference image there, and I know some of you might be busy with other things, but if you do have time to paint and you want to join in, then you're welcome to and you're welcome to post any sketches or paintings that you do in the chat and share with us and this I do. I do this every Wednesday. So if today is not a good day for you to join in, but you're interested in doing that in the future, then yeah, I hope to see you next next Wednesday. Maybe can join in then. OK, so. We're still in the early messy phase, but it's starting to get more fun. Let's move over to the right side of the water, get some of these. Rocks painted in. I like to use a brush that is square or rectangular. You know that has a lot of sharp edges. I like to use these types of brushes when I'm painting rocks, mountains, buildings, things that have hard edges and that you want to appear more hard. I think it's a lot easier than using a round brush. Personally, I know some people are like all about the hard round brush, and that's totally cool, but I like a hard brush for stuff like this. Feel like it makes it easier. OK, so I mentioned earlier when I'm painting a landscape I like to work back to front. So far this things first and then getting closer to us. But there is kind of an exception sometimes sometimes and for me I think the water here is a little bit of an exception because it's so prominent. It's such a big part of the image. It look how big of a space that actually takes up in the picture, so I think I want to paint the water or at least start blocking in the water now. Even though technically some of the foliage might be further back if we're going to go back to front, but I want to get the water out of the way, or at least start getting something in there for the water first. So I'm going to do that and then will paint. The foliage will save my favorite for lasts, 'cause it's definitely my favorite. I love painting grass and foliage and trees and all that stuff. I'm going to give it a try, but I'm not sure if were able to post images here. Hey, I see us you can. You cannot post an image, but if you post your image anywhere else and then you get an URL, you can put the URL in the chat and then I can look at it. If it's up to you. But if you posted it on social media or on like injure or here on, be hands if you post it here anywhere on your profile then you can put the link in chat and then that's how I would be able to see it. But you're right, I don't think you can just post the picture right in, that's that's true. Oh, thank you Pilar, thank you. Yeah, this picture. This reference gives a really, really good example of atmospheric perspective, so that's the idea that when things get further away from you, they're going to generally be lighter in value. This is more obvious if we put it in black and white, so less contrast overall. Much lighter and. More color of the Sky in the atmosphere is going to affect the mountains, so like the trees are mostly appearing in their real color. 'cause I really close to us. But these mountains back here there a little bit more hazy and purple so it shows the distance. And I really, really like this effect in landscape painting 'cause it can give you the feeling that you're there. So I'm going to make a new layer. I think underneath. This one, so I think it makes sense when I'm painting the water to paint underneath of this layer, so we're going to do that and I'm going to try to pick the right colors. If you look down here. So for me when I'm trying to decide what colors to use here, I'm looking. At the bottom left and you can see that the water is almost the same value as the foliage in the bill, and it's only a little bit brighter, so I'm going to color pic from here and use that as a starting point and. Maybe shift a little bit warmer, but this is a difficult one when it comes to painting water, like in a scene like this, because the water isn't it isn't blue, or it isn't the Aqua kind of color you imagine when you think of water because mostly it's just reflecting everything around it. This water is basically like a mirror of the environment, so you see some greens from all the plans that we haven't painted in yet. But they're coming, uh, a lot of greens in the water. And also. Reflection of the Sky. So that was part of the reason when I chose the color for the Sky. I just painted the entire canvas that color because I also knew that showing through to that color in the water and some other areas was going to be handy. So. I'm sticking with a this big square brush for awhile because right now I'm just blocking in the very basic forms and I don't want to get too detailed, so I'm going to stick with this brush even though it doesn't give a very realistic look 'cause it's pretty big and Blockish, but I will will will be able to tone down. Will be able to choose a different brush for later when we want to do polishing up and stuff like that, but this is like a trick that I learned from a traditional artist. If anybody is familiar with James Gurney, he's a really amazing. Painter and he does a lot of traditional work and traditional tutorials on YouTube. His link to his YouTube and his book is in my resources page below the description if you're interested in finding that you can find it there, but his name is James Gurney, you guys might be familiar with them already, but he does a lot of teaching about color and light. Has a book on that subject and it's something that he talks about in his YouTube channels a lot or his videos on his YouTube channel. A lot. But one of his one of his suggestions was for traditional painters to use the biggest brush they can. For the longest time that they can, before scaling down to smaller brush an in traditional. That's a little easier, because if you're using a big brush, yeah, you cannot. If you're still using that brush, then you can only paint that a certain size. So kind of restricts you there, but with digital. It's a lot easier to switch sizes of your brush. I have my brush. That make the brush bigger and smaller. Those are I'm using shortcut keys on my keyboard, so I'm pressing keyboard keys to make my brush bigger and smaller. There's so many different ways to do this, you can use the buttons on your tablet. If you have a tablet with buttons on it, you can use. You can set your stylus. You can set these two you know. There's just so many ways to personalize your shortcuts. So for me I have my shortcuts on my keyboard and I find that a lot of times I even when I'm trying not to go make my brush small. It's hard because I have such a subconscious habit. I'm like doing it without thinking, so it's really hard to control that, but I try to keep it in mind. Don't go too small too soon where still blocking things in and we want to get the big picture. So one thing that can help with that is not zooming in like I'm trying not to zoom in and I'm trying to keep my whole canvas visible 'cause once you zoom in then you're like going into detail on this one part and forgetting about the rest. And eventually there can be a time for that, like when you're polishing up at the end. But early on try to stay zoomed out when you're painting, so that way you're making sure that everything works in. Respect to each other. The colours and the values like the darks and lights there. That they all work together in a way that makes sense and I like to have a little thumbnail version of my reference too, 'cause that helps me keeping them keeping them smaller. The images smaller helps. OK, so I think that's an OK start for the water. I might actually merge these together now. I like to merge often, but don't feel like you have to do this. I just. I find that if I emerge more quickly than I more decisive with my painting, I find it a little bit more fun and it I don't second guess my decisions and try to like go back and change things as much. Mostly when I'm doing studies, I'll merge pretty often if I'm doing work that I'm really concerned that it comes out very good. If I'm doing like some client work or something that I'm going to want to want to be able to change things, then maybe I will. Maybe I will not merge as much, but in studies especially I merge pretty often just so I can kind of keep the flow. So. Welcome everyone who's just getting here. Welcome sharmin. I hope I'm saying your name right. Thank you AJ D. Hey Tanager. Well, thanks for coming over. I like how the brush makes me feel like I'm in a poorly rendered game from the 90s, right? Or like your take your glasses off or something. Yeah, we'll get there. Will get there. OK so I'm going to make a new layer on top of this one. And. Let's finally add some foliage so. I'm going to color pic from this color here. This is about to my. I feel like this is about the darkest. Color in my painting and that's where it is. So we have a little bit more room to go darker and I think we probably should go a little bit darker and we obviously want to come over here for to get a nice green. So let's start blocking us in. So one thing that I've noticed in painting a lot of foliage is that in the. Shadows these greens will often appear more like blue, like a deep green with like more blue, or at least at least less saturated cooler Blues color, blue greens and anytime that you get a green that's being hit by the light, like if there's a plant that has light either shining through or shining on leaves, you'll often get a lot more like yellow green, so that's something to think about. So I'm going to try not to get too detailed yet, but. We're going to start getting into a place soon where I'm going to need to choose a different brush if I. If I want to get. The texture and the feeling of views in technically you can always just use one brush for the whole painting and just you're going to have to scale it down to smaller size and maybe it'll be a little bit more labor intensive to hand paint all the details rather than using like some kind of foliage brushes or things like that. There's lots of different ways. Pens on your. Your style and your taste, but I found that experimenting with different workflows and different tools. Is really fun and will help you find your style. I'm still like doing that too. I'm experimenting all the time like even this one. This one is a little bit more. Is a little bit different I think. I'm always experimenting and trying to see. You know what we're going to figure out trying to find and you better workflow. I guess my biggest goal right now is trying to combine my. Egg wash. What I've been learning from doing traditional painting and gouache. I'm trying to combine what I've learned from that with my digital paintings. I really love the look of that kind of traditional medium, but I love working in Photoshop and I love all the advantages of digital art so I'm trying to like as much as possible bring. Bring some of those things into into the digital painting, so I'm working on a brush set right now. I'm actually using it right now, but it's not ready yet to be like released for everyone to use its. I'm still like testing and changing some of the brush settings and things, but eventually this brush that will be shared. There is a brush set below the stream. In the description there's a free brush set that I used mostly and for a long time up until I've been making this custom one so. If you are looking for some brushes that are nice to use, I really love a lot of brushes in that set. Thank you Martin. I'll save just in case. I do have just the control S, you know. I press that a lot. I don't even think I. I am thinking about half the time anymore 'cause I kind of got in the habit of doing it, but. When you change the angle of your stylist, does it change the angle of the brush or is it random? So there are some settings you can use to. For that to work, foster. So if you go to the shape dynamics, I believe the angle jitter. If you set that to pen tilt then it is going to take into account your angle of your brush. I find some of those pen tilt settings difficulty use like I kind of like it to just be in the regular regular setting, but you can set this in many different ways, but if you set it to pen tilt then it will do what you're saying, but if you don't set it too. To pen tilt then. Then it will. It will not that it won't affect anything. So to take a moment and sort of. Critique my own work here. I think over here I've lost some of the interesting shapes going on in this in the reference. I think it's too much of like the same shape, the same height over and over. So let's try to do something about that. Make it more interesting. Maybe this can be a little higher up here and then kind of race out a little bit and make this. A little lower. And then have. In this little tree coming up here with some space in between. Sometimes when I'm painting I have to fight that little autopilot that happens where you just kind of painting and repeating the same shapes. I don't know why it happens, but. It does sometimes. OK. Same thing over here. I think we can go a little bit more. Brave with some of these shapes, this one can come up higher. Alright, so now that we're painting in some of the green, another thing I'm noticing is we need to go a little bit darker on the rocks below there, so you could either paint right on this layer if you're feeling really brave, or you can make a new layer in between the two paint there. I'm just going to pay right on the layer and hope for the best. I, Richard said working in regular water cooler this morning, but after what you just said, I switched from a #6 Sable round to number 10. Really let me check it out. Oh, this is awesome. Yeah, I hope you don't mind if I show the image on the screen here. Beautiful. Yeah, I hope that idea helps. The idea of working with a larger brush for longer. I've personally found that really helpful. Kenny says, here's a Commission I recently completed. Um Oh I. I think Kenny. I think you need to upload that somewhere and then put the URL in chat. 'cause it looks like it just taking the file from your PC but there's not currently away to upload images into the directly into the chat, but if you post that to your be hands or like social media or post it to imgur or something like that then you can take that link and post it in the chat. But I'm sorry were not able to see your link. But hey, I'm glad you're I'm glad you're enjoying your. Your painting makes me happy. I want to get into digital painting, but I'm not sure where to start. Any tips? Sure, I actually have a link below the stream in the description. I'll post the link in chat too for anyone in case it's not showing up or anything like that, but. This is our resource page I've just been collecting over the past six 6 1/2 years that I've been doing digital art since I first got involved in it and. Things that helped me along the way an I add to it all the time when I find a new resources that I think are useful. There's some guides on tablets, so there's some software and hardware information on there, and there's a lot of tutorials for like YouTube and so there's some free and some paid resources on there, so you gotta browse through it and see what you're looking for. Oh I'm sorry, faster, I can tell you the abbreviated version of the answer. Though. Long story short, you can turn your angle jitter under shape dynamics. You can turn your angle jitter onto pen. I know, I'm sorry under pen tilt, if you do that then it will do what you're saying with the tilt. If you don't then it will. It will not. So it's a specific. It's a specific setting to make that happen, but it is possible. You're welcome, Julian. If you along the way, if you run into any specific questions, you're welcome to come by my streams and ask anytime, but that has a lot of like general info that I hope will help. Right, so we're adding some darker shadows here and there's random rocks and things. Some are bigger than the others, so it's nice to use the. The rectangle brush. Always find difficulties in grass and stone ground surface. Yeah, I find Stonean Rock really difficult to paint, so I understand on that one. But hey, that's part of the reason I'm doing these photo studies as I think they do help. So we just gotta keep practicing. There we go. OK, I'm able to see this link now. Kenny, thank you. This is Kenny's work and chat. Really nice work. I like the textures a lot of very traditional feeling textures going on in here too. Hey Jesper, welcome it is relatively knew so. Open. A lot of fun. Find digital painting more enjoyable. When I'm not trying too hard and let the brush flow, I really relate to that. I really relate to that. It's hard sometimes to let go. You know 'cause you want to make good work. Everyone wants to make good work, but I do think that my most enjoyable painting sessions have come from when I'm just kind of relaxed and not worried about how things turn out. I think for me the biggest thing was. Starting to do studies that I had no plans on posting on social media, like doing some studies just for yourself just for your own enjoyment and not thinking. Oh this has to be really good because I'm going to share it or this has to be really good. 'cause I'm going to make a print of it. You know, just having fun with the art. Just having fun with the study and being open to the fact that this might just be an hour or two study that I never look at again. I have done a lot of those over the past couple of years that I never did before. So so for some of you this might be old news. But for me I used to put a lot of effort into every single painting, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wouldn't do any studies. I was only making paintings and spending a lot of time on the paintings. I wasn't making mixing in any quick studies, and when I started doing that, it changed everything. It really got me to relax more with my art, knowing that not everything that I've painted was going to be. Perfect and letting myself make mistakes in those studies. Took a lot of the pressure off so. I definitely. It definitely encourage everyone to do some studies. Do some photo studies or some experiments where you really just relax and don't worry about the results so much. OK, so here let's go over what layers I have real quick. We've got the background. Which is just this gradient that we painted with the. Um? Airbrush then we have this layer which is the water and the rocks and mountains and then this layer which is the beginning of the foliage. But it's still pretty abstract. On top of that is is the sketch which eventually we won't need anymore, but we still need. Still need it right now. This is. Men DG brush. That's Cute. That's really cool. This is one thing that I like about. Uhm, this is from Sathish in the in the chat. This is one thing I like about using digital format instead of or as an alternate to printed books. You can have these little animations that really bring things alive. I think that's cool. I think that's really something. Even just a little bit, just the snow coming down. I like that. OK, let's. Get this tree blocked in. I'm going to use the same brush just a little bit smaller. And you know, maybe I should change my brush up. I want to be able to get a point at the end of these branches, so let's do that. Let's change to a brush that. Let me get a more. More point the end. So in the reference you can see the branches kind of curve in out and around. From Scotland welcome, thanks for being here. I've been to Scotland one time and it was so beautiful. I've been wanting to go back. I was Super Lucky I went there and family vacation. And we had a great weather the whole time. It was Super Sunny and beautiful. And. Yeah, I, uh people, the locals kept telling me like, Oh, you're so lucky to have this weather. Now I live in the Netherlands, so I'm also used to a lot of rain. Originally from the US. Alright, so I'm just painting in the branches I I've always liked to do the branches 1st and then add the. The leaves, 'cause I find that it helps too. Give me an idea where to concentrate the leaves, you know. If I don't have, it's like drawing a person and kind of sorting out the skeleton first or the anatomy first before adding clothes on top. You know it really helps you to know what you're doing. I like painting dark on dark backgrounds. Oh cool, so first of all, your work is awesome, but you're saying You started this. On a black background, like maybe something of this color was like the background. Nicely done. Oh yeah, I'm curious. Curious, oh, I see at the bottom I see at the bottom so you started with the blue yeah, rather than a than a white white background. I hope I'm understanding that correctly, but nice work. Really nice work. A related link projects here, not just inspiration, not my personal projects. I prefer if people are sharing art that it's their own work. You guys are. Yeah, I would prefer that. I have a discord community for anybody that doesn't know, there's a share inspiration channel in the discord. If you want to share stuff there, that's awesome, but if you're sharing here, I would prefer to be your own work that you have. Yeah, just to make sure everyone has permissions for what they're sharing. OK, so we've got our tree. I'm going to make a new layer and start painting some of the. Leaves and stuff on top of the tree. First, had the Sky is the background, but the last two are on darks cool. Yeah I used. I did kind of the same thing. This one is all Sky background and then. Going on top. Thanks Jesper. I'm going to color pic from the. The tree 3 branch that's a nice dark. Green Brown color and use that to bring a couple textures now. So here's the brush I'm using right now. This is another brush I made that I'm working on tweaking, but I like it. It it gives a little bit of a look of dry brushing like I I like to use a flat. Hum. Flat brush when I paint in Gouache and for foliage and stuff I like to. Have the brush a little bit more dry and this is supposed to imitate that kind of texture. So we'll try to try to do that up here too, so I'm looking at the reference to to give me some idea of how dense the leaves should be, and we want to keep it pretty area up here. I think down here the foliage is a little bit more dense, but up here in the tree we've got a lot of space in between the leaves, and it's pretty pretty late in area, so I think I will probably either erase out or paint the Sky back in between, but they'll probably be a little bit of back and forth until I get the texture that I like. But Yeah, I'm a big fan of this look. Painting a little bit more more loose and the idea that hopefully this is going to look. Hopefully will look like leaves or give the impression of leaves and branches, but I'm not painting any individual. Any individual leaves. Just something that from a distance will look like that I hope. And you can take a different brush with a different texture an erase out that can create a cool look. And again, with the happy accidents, this can be a way that you might use a brush that you don't know how the texture will react with the other brush. So using a different texture to erase out that can make some cool effects. Also, I like to flip my canvas. I haven't been doing it a lot this. Stream yet, but I really should be doing it more. Flipping the canvas aurizon to Lee is a nice way to get like a fresh look at your image and sometimes it will point out to you if things are a little wonky, but it looks OK so far. Brush that's a little bit harder shapes. And. Add some little kind of individual leaf type shapes here. So here's something to note I've been painting with A green color that's a little bit lighter than the. The tree trunk and the branches. If I want the branches to still remain the darkest thing I can put this layer instead of on normal mode. I can put it on dark in, So what that does is. The what I've painted on this layer is only going to affect. Um areas that are lighter than the color that I'm painting, so. Basically this green is lighter than the branches, so it won't lighten them anymore. Only things will be allowed to darken, not lighten things below them. I hope it makes sense. So yeah, I. Can turn on dark in if I turn it back to normal you'll see the difference, so this is normal. And this is dark, and so it depends on what you're looking for. I think I will leave it on normal mode, but I just wanted to play with that and see if I see how it looked to see what we liked. Alright, so I'll flip this back. Just wanted to take a little look from the other angle. If anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well and you're enjoying a painting that's the most important thing. Hope you're having fun. Hi Steve, I am using a tablet. I have a Wakame Centriq 22. That's the model of tablet that I have and. Yeah, this kind of painting would be very, very difficult to do with the mouse. It doesn't mean that you have to run out and buy a super expensive tablet, but I think a tablet would be needed and the reason for that is I'm using brushes that have pressure sensitivity alot. So that means so if you look at your my brush palette here I have transfer checked. So what this does is it allows me to press really light. And then press really dark and you see the difference and you really need to have a tablet to be able to detect this difference in how you're pressing. If you're using a mouse, you're basically going to have everything at like the full darkness. You can go up and adjust opacity here, but it's a much more time consuming process, so while you can do a lot of digital art with a mouse, especially like vector art and maybe some matte painting photo bashing type stuff, I really advise if you're going to get into digital painting and you want a more natural look. To at least just look into tablets, there's they've really come down in price, and there's a lot of different brands available so you don't need to rush out and get an expensive one, but a tablet really is needed for the type of our time doing here. At least to make it. More pleasant experience. Hi, are a welcome. So I'm going over some of the edges of these of the foliage and just giving them hopefully the look of some texture and leaves. I like over here on the right there's some branches that come up a little higher. Are you currently following any art cores? Are you self employed? I am self employed. I am a full time streamer and content creator and painter but. As far as taking any courses, I am always doing something. I'm always watching some kind of video on YouTube or gum road or what not. I'm not in any official schools or anything like that at the moment, but I'm always watching some kind of on line course, it's. There's just so much out there and I'm always trying to improve, and I'm also just interested in it. I'm it's kind of like a hobby, aside from what I do professionally. I really like watching videos and seeing other artists workflows and learning. What they're up to? Is it OK to suggest the cheap tablet for beginners I I'm going to share a link with you guys that I shared earlier and you may not have been here, so let me make sure it's in the chat. This is a link to a tablet review website that's really good and goes over a wide range of beginner tablets and more experienced once it goes all the way down the line and he's got different brands of tablets and different. Styles of tablet. And I would look into that because I have a really hard time suggesting tablets because. There's so many like for one person, their budget can be really, really different. I would say I've heard a lot of good things about XP pen. If you're looking for a cheap tablet that has a has a screen they actually have, I think the least expensive screen tablet right now. So it depends on if you're looking for a tablet, the screen, the Wakame Intuos is a really good option for a non sweetened tablet. I wouldn't call it cheap, but for the for the. Price you get a very good quality tablet that will potentially last for years and be able to scale up with you as your skill level grows. There's a lot of professional artists using the welcome intuos, and it's also good one to start on. But if you're looking for a screen tablet and you don't want to spend too much money, I think XP pen is really good. But I haven't tried them myself so far I've been. I've been using walk home all the way through so I can only recommend based on reviews that I've watched and what I've heard other people talk about. Yeah, that's right. I CS pressure. The pressure levels is super super important. Thank you bro. Yeah if you guys have used any particular tablets and you want to chime in with your experience, that's always welcome. I always appreciate the first hand experience commentary when we have questions like that, so red can recommend Huey on tablets. I've also heard really good things about Huey on. I'm not sure. Again, it depends on your price range. I think that they might possibly be a little bit more expensive than XP pen, but I've heard only good things so far. OK, so I want to go back to this layer and add in between the foliage and the rock layer in the background. I'd like to add some more bright colors. Love the intuos pro medium. Been using it for a long time now. That's why I always hear about people using the into US. They seem to last a long time. Nice, Julian. Seems like a good deal. Yeah, it's really amazing. The prices of tablets Luckily has have come down a lot in the past, like over the last five years it's been crazy. So it's. Going in the right direction as far as making it more accessible. I want to keep this. I want to keep the color really really bright, especially right behind the. Right behind the foliage, so I'm going to go to color dynamics and again turn that on so we get these cool color variations back here. Read says it's the same price range than XP pen. I had two one note screen and one of the screen completely in love. Offered the no screen one through a friend. When I received the screen one for my birthday. Oh, that's really nice red. I'm glad to hear you had such a good experience. So if you look up here at the top left, you'll see that there's some. Sort of striping kind of effect on the. Mountain back here from the light hitting and getting these kind of detailed columns. Started with a bamboo. Had into us at work. Great surface drawing. Now I'm using a mobile studio which is fantastic but he's like hell sometimes that's what I see. It says in the chat. Yeah. The bamboo that was a classic one. I never had a bamboo. I feel a little left out. But I heard that those tablets lasted a long time. OK, so just to explain what I'm doing right now, I'm just kind of going back to my block in of the mountain in the background and adding more detail. So I'm doing this on another layer. Can turn the layer on and off and see. Hopefully we're going in a good direction. Sometimes I end up saying, oh, I'm going to erase out something that I did. Sometimes you paint for awhile and then you look at the before and after and you're like it didn't really go in the direction I wanted, but. Yes, I like to. Keep the layers, keep the new update that I'm doing on a layer above what already exists there. If I'm happy with that and then you can kind of paint for awhile. Check out your work, see if it's going well, and then finally merge it down. If you do like it, that's kind of what I like to do in these scenarios, so I do like to keep merging fairly quickly and keep things on minimal layers. But I also want to make sure that I like what I've done before I merge it down. Nice I frame. Yeah I have recently tried the iPad for painting for the first time. Well, I say recently but. Time is going by. It was for Christmas that I got one and I was also really impressed. Been happy with it so far. Although most of the painting that I do is still on PC but it's really nice to play around with. Hopefully I can get more familiar. Alright, so I will merge these down now. And also I think I'm going to turn off the sketch layer because I think everything that I had planned to do in the sketches now in. So I don't think we need to sketch layer anymore to guide us. I'll leave it there. Just turn the visibility off just in case. I don't throw it away. Um? Yeah, let's keep going. So make a new layer. And come to the. The mountain here maybe a race out. And I want to bring in some of these details. I'm going to turn off color dynamics now 'cause I need to be more precise. So I don't want my colors to be all over the place. I want to bring in some of these little. Shadows and things. Is there any focus on the work this morning? Just an icepick Waterstones true Sky yeah this so this painting isn't really in any kind of theme. It's not part of our the art club studies or anything like that. I just wanted to paint something nice and relaxing today and this scene is got a lot of my favorite things in it because I love painting Canyon scenes and I also love foliage and there's a little bit of both. In this one so. Just the types I did take a day to relax and paint something pretty. But my focus as far as like what I'm trying to work on in this scene, is mostly. I want to work on brushwork using some interesting brushwork and hopefully capturing the mood of the scene. So I've been trying to work on, you know, painting in a more painterly style. So having my paintings appear more like traditional painting. And the idea that you get across the mood of the scene even if we don't paint it hyper. Realistically, you can still get across the mood in the feeling of being there. Am I too late for this loan or how long we work on it? I want to paint along but it is early here. I'm bleary. I know it's really early for you. I'm sorry, clever. Let me take a peek at what time it is. So we've been. We've been. Live for. Yeah, it's been almost an hour. Not quite yet. Actually, it has been an hour. I forgot I've started early earlier. Yeah, I will probably work it be working on this for I imagine another hour at least to get all the try to get nice details in and get it to a more finished place. I would imagine another hour and then we might work on another study after, but you're always welcome to continue on this one if you need more than an hour, for example. We might work on another study directly after this one. So there's some little Tufts of grass is, and things coming up in between rocks here in there, so I want to kind of pop in these little green bits. Going to try this or similar in Frisco. I would love to see that. That's a great idea. And back here in the. As the River curves around the foliage is coming all the way down here to the where the water meets up with the land and it's just all green. Al Green down there. Bring in some of these little. Details so those of you who have been watching this from the beginning or from earlier on, you'll see that the process kind of does slow down. At some point the early stages of this painting go really, really fast, but depending on what you want your. Level of Polish to be. It does take some time, it thinks do kind of slow down. Once you start getting into, you know starting to flesh out details and starting to clean things up, so that's kind of where I am now. Things have slowed down a little bit, but. Yeah, it will pay off. I think we get things looking a little nicer. There's a rock that comes out over here, that's a. Bit of a. Square rectangular shape. I think I will add that in. A little darker overall in the shadows over here. And there's a bit of rim lighting, which I'm a big fan of. I mean, who isn't but a little bit of light hitting the top of this. This rock over here. Little bit of warm light tops that out. I'm here too. Blood or not, that's rim lighting, but give it a little lighting. So. I think. I'm getting close to wanting to merge the foliage layer onto the layer of the mountains and just paint that all is one. Have the freedom to just paint the wherever? So let's just. Erase out a couple more things that I think. That I don't love and then we'll just merge them. OK, so here's our layers. Basically, the background gradients and then everything else. I think it might be nice to paint a little bit in the Sky. I can basically just take any. Any brush and I don't want to ruin the nice gradient we have there, but if I am trying to give this nice traditional kind of feeling, it might be nice to just put some brush strokes in the Sky just as like a stylistic thing, but we don't need to. It doesn't really need to make sense, it just needs to look cool. Sometimes we can have our brush strokes kind of aiming in towards the focal point. Now if you were to use this, indicate cloud something like that you could add some clouds this scene. But you know, sometimes there's these light wispy clouds up in the Sky, so even just some of these light brush strokes can indicate just a little bit of clouds without us needing to really over explain them or get too specific with the clouds and it just keeps things a little interesting, so I'm going to keep the brushstrokes aiming inward towards the focal point. You can lower the Opacity on that if it's too much, but it's fun to experiment with. Alright, I will merge that down so some barely there brush strokes in this guy think is kind of cool. We can always come back to it later since that layer is on its own. It's pretty safe. Take a moment for some tea. OK. So painting on a layer above the. The rocks and everything. And this is a little bit of trial and error here, but I'm grabbing some brushes that I think can give a little bit of a wispy kind of texture for some of these random grasses and things going on here. And I'm trying to stick to natural looking green, so I'm keeping them pretty desaturated. I'm trying not to go with any like bright bright greens. You know, those like Saint Patrick's Day kind of greens. It took me along time painting foliage to be able to choose more natural looking greens. I always would oversaturate them, and again, that could be a style could be a style that if you're if you paint very cold, very colorful, and that's your thing, something wrong with it, but I was going for a realistic looking. I was struggling to get that, and one of the biggest things that I learned. Was that a lot of times green has more yellow than you think. It's more towards like an olive yellow color than you might think to get some of these. These realistic looking green colors, so that might be happening to you too. If you feel any struggle with your green paintings, try adding a little more yellow. Some nice little. Tufts down here. I think it is important for them to be darker at the bottom. Later at the top. So you can turn the layer on and off. I do find that once I've merged a bunch of layers, I find a lot more. I make a lot more quick progress after that step. Then I find it a lot more freedom to just paint wherever I want to paint over mistakes rather than trying to go back to whatever layer that was on and maybe erase it or whatever you know, just paint over it there. Kings on one layer, nice. Of course, depending on the art style you're going for, that might not work. If you want things to be very clean and you've got like line art and then separate layers, then you don't want to merge it down and they have a pain later when you're trying to separate things. So it depends. One of my favorite things in painting foliage is when you get an effect of a lighter background shining through the trees or plants and you get this a lot with, you know, the nice bright Sky shining through and back. Here we have a situation where the. Light is shining on these mountains, and that's creating the same kind of effect, and so let me choose a brush for this. But basically you can do fun things like leaving color pic from this bright orange and then find a couple places and just paint that back in. In this big blob BLOB BLOB of Green. And it looks like little spaces in between the. Bush is in the trees, you know, at least to me. I think it's working. And that's pretty cool. Hi welcome everybody. Yeah, you can paint this little dots. Merge it down and then I make a new layer so I do a lot of like merging and then immediately making a new layer. And that's because I like the overall of. Process of having the merged, but I do like to have the ability to paint on that separate layer kind of check my work before merging it down so it's a little bit of for me. It's kinda best of both worlds. That's my workflow. So I'm going to take a darker color and start trying to paint in some. Indication of stones and. Rocks and things over here. There's also pretty. Dark shadow over here under this rock so. As we get as things get closer and closer to us, then we're going to get more of those real colors. Those local colors and. Also, darker shadows. Overall like everything back here, these mountains. Nothing is going to be really really dark there, so I'm going to be pretty light, but here we're getting into the darker things. I have customized these brushes and they are not available yet because I'm still working on making them, but when they're finished I will. They will be for sale. But there is a free brush pack under the description. You may maybe saw it already, but there is a free brush back that I used for quite a long time and I still love is a good brush pack. That's what I was using up before I started trying to make these so there's a lot of good brushes there. If you need some. Of traditional textures and things, but at the moment the one I'm using right now I'm in the process of testing it, so I'm sorry I can't share it yet. But what I'm doing today and with a lot of these recent streams is I've just been using this brush set so that I can test it and tweak the textures and as soon as it's ready then it will be available. Bye. But I want it to be really good. I don't want any weird glitches or anything, so we're taking our time. Going to switch to a flat brush. Try to get some of these shines in the water. So back here the water does have some. Dark. Areas, and that's part of what makes it look shiny, so. For anybody who needs any tips on painting shiny things, one thing that I noticed is it really helps if you put high contrasts. A lot of what makes things look shiny is high contrast, very bright and very dark areas next to each other. That will make something look shiny and hard edges, so it's kind of tough. But gotta be bold. Gotta go. High contrast. Be brave. Then it will be shiny promise. So there's a lot of pink in the water. I in the reference, that's what I'm seeing and I think it's a lot of reflection of this back here. It's like a. This all this light from the mountain reflecting kind of pink and. Non colors in the water. I think it's pretty. There's some kind of ripple effects, so I'm going to try to paint those in. I'm basically painting. It's hard to see right now, but I'm painting like little angle strokes like this down here. I'm trying to get. These like ripple. Triple shapes. And some will be highlights and some will be rolled darker, darker ripples. I still feel like this area on the left is not quite dark enough, let's. Let's go a little bit darker. In the water. There's a lot of shadow. From all this foliage. And it should be a little bit more dark. Trying to find the right color. But I'm trying to keep my brush strokes going in the direction of the water is flowing. I hope that's going to give it some kind of motion. Anne will flip the canvas. 'cause I haven't flipped in awhile maybe? Maybe this helps. Sometimes I flip my canvas o'clock when I'm painting, but I hope it doesn't annoy anyone. To watch. But I find it really helpful if anybody is wondering. It just kind of gives you a fresh look at what you're doing. Sort of forces your brain to reprocess the image somehow, and like you'll notice little wonky things sometimes. What brushes do you use for your initial blocking? So I am using brushes from a brush pack that I'm creating so they're not available yet, but there's a brush very similar to the one that I used to block this in. If you download the brush pack in the description below. There's brush called rectangle texture, and that's a great brush for blocking things in. It's got a little bit of it's a rectangle brush, which is similar to what I was using an it's got a lot of. Well, it has a nice texture. It's not too strong. But I have hard edges and it's really good for blocking things in, so I would try that one and eventually hopefully soon I'll be able to share the one that I was actually using. But I'm still working on it. Up Great tip getting shiny nice, thanks for him and I really hope it helps. I remember paintings honestly. The first part when I when I started to realize that about shiny textures, I was doing some fan art of. Catwoman and I was painting her outfit, which was very shiny, and I was being there is being very careful. I was being timid with the texture and it was looking very mad. And then eventually after studying a lot of pictures of like latex, I realized that. You really need to go super bold with the darks and lights. And anyway I learned that lesson. It's helped alot in other subjects to other than painting costume Catwoman but yeah I hope it helps. I see us as I find it a bit faster to change the blending mode of the brush rather than than the color really. So you like to turn the brush onto like color, Dodge or something like that instead of. Instead of. Changing the color. I do like using blending modes, but I generally use them to kind of alter and edit what I've done usually later in the painting process. Rather than a lot of times during the painting, but that has changed, I used to use blending modes a lot more often. I think that as I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with choosing my own colors, yeah, I feel like I'm choosing the colors I want more quickly in the painting process. Then before so I'm using normal layer more often, but I really like color Dodge overlay. Multiply all those for helping to alter things that I've done. Yeah, Catwoman has a lot of shine, so true high manual welcome. Thanks for being here. OK, so I want to work on this sort of outcropping or she wants to call it, but this area of land that comes protrudes out into the water. I feel like how I've painted mine right now is just not. It's just not enough. There's too much water and I really like the shapes of these rocks coming out and I'm going to block in a bigger area here. Maybe we'll go back to the initial. Brush that I was using to block things in but we need. Need more land? Come out. There's like a little beach type. All thanks could you? I thought that was you. I thought that was you. Thanks for coming over. Hope you're having a good day. Do you ever bake all the layers and use the camera raw filter to tweak the colors and value? Uhm, I have not, but that's an interesting idea. But I have not done that. what I usually do for tweaking that stuff personally is I'll use adjustment layers. So yeah, I'll just use adjustment layers that they at the end or sometimes during the process if I'm stuck on something, I'll use adjustment layers to help figure it out, so that's usually my way of doing it, but there's so many ways to do things there's so many different ways to do things in photo shop, so a lot of it will come down to what you find comfortable in your workflow. There's a lot of ways to answer certain questions. Different ways to do it. Are red shared a study from a reference from pixels, let's see. Ooh, I love this kind of environment. I was actually thinking of painting something like this today. That's beautiful red oops. OK, there goes my whole. All my stuff, sorry about that you guys. Anyway. There's a like a shortcut that closed on my windows. Bring everything back now. Anyway, beautiful work read. I hope you guys can see this. I love the lighting and I love all these leaves especially in this area. Let's see if I can bring back the chat there. We go trying hard to do environment stuff while you're doing very well. I love this group of leaves. He ran in this area with the high contrast and the light shining through. Gives a really really pretty 5. Well done. Very well done. Thanks for sharing. Yeah, I'm wait the depending on what we have time for today we might do. Do a waterfall scene that's like some of my favourites. Subject matters of paint. I find waterfalls actually pretty difficult to paint, but for some reason I still like painting them. So like such a such a beautiful, lush environment, usually surrounding waterfalls. Alright, so back to our little. Area here. So the before and after. I think it's getting better, but we still gotta keep going. Bring this out further. It's just a little bit more interesting. This coming out into the water and then we get these nice texture texture variety between the. The shiny water reflective and then the very matte surface of this sand. I think that's really nice contrast. And there's some little rocks in the water. I don't know if I will include all of them. I think it's a bit busy. It's easier to read the scene maybe without so many, but a couple of them I think will do the job. So let's try it on another layer, 'cause I'm like happy with what we have so far. Let's try another layer in case I don't like what I do. And I will just paint in some rocks. And also erase out. The bottom if we don't get a flat enough, we need the bottom to be really flexed, basically disappearing below the water so. On their own layer, we're going to add a bunch of rocks here. What I'm doing is making a creating a like a Dome shape and then holding shift and using my eraser to erase out, whoops, wrong. Actually go to the eraser using my eraser to erase out the bottom. So let me do it up here so that it makes sense so you can see it more clearly will do big one. So making like a Dome shaped like this then hold shift. And erase out the bottom. So then we have a nice flat edge down there. That's the fastest way I think to do this. Or you can use the lasso tool to make a selection, but sometimes it racing back into shape is really handy, especially because it's kind of nice if use a textured eraser and in this case. Don't erase out everything but kind of do something like this. That's kind of cool. 'cause then when you fit that into the water, it just looks like there's a little bit of water coming up over the Rock You know? So I think that's nice rather than a perfectly to make it look like there's a little splash or something by erasing out. So it's really fun to think about how you can use your eraser like this. Sometimes it's hard to paint these creative shapes with the just with the brush, but if you paint the shape and erase out you can come up with something more interesting. We got a bunch of little rocks here and I'm also just considering the shape right now. I'm not even thinking about color because it's on its own layer. It's going to be really easy to change the colors of these with the clipping mask or just lock the transparency in paint on top of it. So for example, you can press this button up here. The checkerboard button. This will lock the layer transparency so that what that means is the only area that I'm going to be able to paint on is the area of already painted on, which is the shape of these rocks so I can choose a lighter color. And then go right on top like this and the color I'm painting it is only going to affect. Within that rock shape, so it's really easy to paint in the lines you know I can just take any color and add a little bit of a highlight, and I don't even have to be precise about it, 'cause it's not going to go out of the lines and you just pop in a little highlight. So that's that. Now these rocks are a little bit bigger than in the reference. We can decide if we like that. You know we have freedoms in our work. You can have artistic license. We don't have to do everything exactly like the reference. I'm just trying to learn about the. The colors in the mood basically is what I'm trying to take from this reference, but we can make changes to little things. I'd like to get more brave with taking making changes, but I want to find the balance because if I let myself go, if I let me get myself go off too much, then I don't think I'll be learning as much from the reference. I still have a lot to learn and I want to keep learning about colors and shapes of things, and so I think if I go too far off the reference then I'm more referencing my own ideas in my head and less of a study where I'm learning from what you see here in front of us. So trying to find balance. Thank you, thanks machiavelli, I'm glad you think so. I'm happy with it so far. I think I'm going to merge down these rocks. Let's do it. So we're back. I want to get us back to our background layer and then everything else here on top of it. And then we start again with a new layer, keep going. I think it'll be fun to put little splashes in the water, so I haven't zoomed in yet on my reference. I do have it full screen. Oh yeah, that's what I'm missing. Pure ref. OK, be rough is back. So I have my reference full screen next to, well, not quite full screen but larger version next to chat so I can see that, but at some point I might actually zoom in on that so we can see some little more little details and. We need to. Thank you Sathish, thank you. Appreciate it. I'm surprised actually. I thought earlier on I was going to want to come back and do a lot more to the mountain. But I think it's kind of cool the way it looks. Maybe I'll leave it loose like that. We're going to keep painting the stuff closer to us first, 'cause That's a little bit more important to look cleaner stuff a little bit closer to us. And then we'll decide if we want to do more on that mountain back there or not. There's one thing I'm noticing in the reference, and that is a pretty dark line. Like a Ridge of foliage that's a little bit darker. Back here and then later coming towards us. and I have that going on in mind, but I think it could be a little stronger so want to bring this. Dark shadow down here. Especially at the bottom of each of these, Bush is and things it tends to start out in Shadow and then come up and the tops of the Bushes are reaching out into the light a little bit. I'm going to make a selection over here because I want to use it as a stencil for myself. And make a selection of the area that I want to be able to paint with in and then I can just go like this. And have these grass is come up from in between these rocks here and I don't want to have to worry about. The bottom edge being clean. Ryan Oh my God. Hey Ryan, how are you guys? Don't be alarmed, Ryan is kidding. Oh That's. I hope you're doing good. I want to say that before anyone starts yelling at you in the chat. I think the amount looks great, maybe more detailed their River compared to the mountain. I think you're right, the River needs the River needs to really feel crisp, at least in one area at least. Maybe here where it's like the focal area we need more crisp details in the water and then the rest can be slightly looser and we can get away with it I think. But I like that idea. OK, so let's do it. Whoops, wrong brush. I like using flat brushes for. These are grass is and things and this is the same thing with the traditional. I also like to do this if you've got grass is growing like out of the ground using these types of brushes is a really easy way to block them in like that so. Yeah it is. It is already one almost two o'clock here in the Netherlands. Yeah, we just had our time change so. We are now. Ahead of one more hour from. EST time zone. Which is sad for me since my family mostly lives in EST, but. That's OK. We're getting used to it. You can have some little more little Tufts of green here. In between these rocks. Trying to be brave at this flatbread 'cause it's pretty bold shapes that's making, although it doesn't help us to make strong shapes, it's kind of hard to. Avoid it when you're using a brush like this. OK, so let's work on this little area of land coming out into the water and the. The water itself too. I think you actually where is this? It might say it on the end splash page. Let's take a look at the original post. Odds ion its Zion National Park. This shouldn't surprise me. This is I have to visit this place someday. Is the original photographers post on unsplash Kevin and go? Yeah, I absolutely love any pictures that I've seen from Zion National Park. I hope I can visit there someday. I've painted a few different. Landscapes from this park. Only from photos though. But one day I'll visit. Yeah, yeah, it's a famous one. Maybe a lot. It maybe guys recognized that I should have guessed that. That's absolutely beautiful. You guys are welcome to use that reference image if you like it. It's below. The link is below in the description and it's a. I like to use pixels and Unsplash, Pixabay places like that to find reference images for studying. Because they are they've been uploaded their free to use the photographers. I've made them free to use so you don't have to worry about. Infringing And use them for studies. Yeah, we're getting there cleaning up cleaning up over here. All right, what can we do with the water? I think I'm actually going to zoom in finally. Utah and USB seen beautiful sort of stuff nearby at Arches National Park. That's a good recommendation. Clever, maybe I can look up some images from there too. Did you prank owl this morning? No, I didn't. I'm not much of a prankster to be honest like I. I don't know if I've ever done any April fools pranks. Maybe when I was a kid. Yeah, I'm a little boring when it comes to that stuff. And I like to scare people. Think I've actually been in or near this stream to be honest, just start doing the study. This photo will see how it turns out. Nice ramen, good luck. OK. Have fun with it and if you need more time, don't worry about taking. You know. Don't worry about trying to keep up with me, 'cause I've obviously got quite a Head Start here, so take your time. So I want to put some little darker shadows in the water ripples. Near the rocks to make it look a little more convincing. Like there. Infecting the environments around them like there's some shadows because of them. April 1st has been canceled this year, right? My heart can't take it. I can't take it. Oh my gosh, yeah, I'm glad your wife stepped in on that one. Brian. Two cruel. Too cruel. Oh Oh my gosh. After that, they're never going to listen to you going back to school every time they're going to be like. Do we believe it? Can you believe it? Alright, darkening up the shadow on the left. So I think the shadow is really important. This is a shadow, but it's also reflection in the water of all these trees which are in shadow is part of what we get all these dark. Dark colors in the water over here. I like to use a lot of horizontal and vertical strokes to in water to give this shiny and. Reflective look. So even when I'm not really seeing it there in the water, in this scene a ton, I've painted a lot of water scenes where I've seen this happen, so I know that. It kind of works. There's one thing that's one benefit of painting a lot of. Studies is that sometimes you start to learn certain patterns, and even if you're painting a scene where that particular thing isn't happening there you've painted enough similar scenes to say, OK, well, I can still use this technique. I've learned it from other scenes, and I know that it will work here, and it might look cool, you know, so I can paint these kind of vertical. Vertical paint strokes in here and I think it will work. Painting is witchcraft. Hey Pavlos, there does seem like there's some magic involved. Alright, turn that on and off. Make sure we're going in the right direction, and I think overall, yes. Let me flip this too 'cause it might be a little annoying to see that going the opposite direction. I'm going to still bring some of these. Darker Blue Green. Shadows. Kind of indicate these ripples. There's a lot of detail in the water. I'm not going for photo realism. Then I would lose my mind in this one. So we're just trying to get the the overall effect in a hopefully simpler way illustrating it. But there's all these little. Ripples and splashes and things are going to start getting some of these in there. Hey. Hey your friends. How are you? We're doing good here. Painting one of my favorite types of environments, so I'm happy. When I. Trader Put a little bit of texture in the water here to make it look like these little bubbles and ripples and things. We'll see how that goes. There's a lot of this, like disruption in the water. And that's also pretty because you get that contrast between the areas where there's a lot of like ripples in bubbles and then the area where it's a little bit more glassy and smooth and shiny. So I think that's pretty contrast. Maybe it takes a little more time. It's too much. Do we like it? I don't know yet. I don't know yet. I can't murder down yet I'm not convinced. Add some more highlights, so going back and forth with highlights and shadows. Bring back some of the pink Oh yeah, I can move this back now. Sometimes it's nice to zoom out. Yeah, you can see the difference in what's going on with mine and the reference. So I need to bring some. From the highlights out here. I've sort of. Organize all my highlights in the center. Really, this whole area needs more brightness based on what I'm seeing when I zoom out because a lot more clear to compare mine to the reference. With tablet, are you using of Centriq 13 HD and it's cool, but it feels so slippery like have a lot more control when I'm sketching on paper then of honest antique. So I am using the Wakeham Centriq 22 and I I do know what you're talking about. I'm personally I'm happy with the 22, but I feel like overtime this antique. They have been improving the feeling of the tablet, my. Previous tablet I had the 2424 HD an I felt like that surface was a very very smooth and it took me along time to get used to it. I mean I love the tablet. It was a nice big screen and I'm not complaining but yeah it was a difficult at the beginning because of how slippery it was and I was coming from traditional painting so I was. Definitely not used to that type of difference from paper to the slippery screen, but I think that there are improving overtime because now I have the new 22 and it feels a lot better. It's a lot less slippery and more a little bit more. Matt, a little bit more like saten for lack of better explanation, but it's still not quite like paper, but I like the surface on this one. So that might be something that's slowly improving. You might be able to buy some kind of. She, like a protective sheet to put on top. I'm not sure I've heard of those for like the iPad. I don't know if there's one person teak or not, but you might be able to buy something that goes on top that adds more texture. But I'm sorry that it's feeling slippery and then not super happy with it and he's a good tablet. The 13 HD is a good tablet, but I. Think. Yeah, a lot of the tablets suffer from that a bit. I don't think the technology with any of the tablets is quite to the point where it's like exactly like paper, but it might eventually be there, but it's getting closer. It's getting getting overall getting better as time goes on. So I'm adding little highlights to the foliage back here. Right now we've got a big mass of darker green, but I'm trying to add little. Little circular Tufts and things to show. Light hitting and different branches. Jasper says added a piece of paper on top of into Uspro gives it more grip. That's cool. I mean, especially if you don't. If you're using a tablet that doesn't have a screen, you don't. You can just put a piece of paper and it's not like it's blocking you from seeing anything so. I imagine that you might use up your nibs a little bit more quickly, but. It might be worth it if the painting is that much more. Comfortable. Yeah. That makes sense. All right, so we're getting closer to finishing this one. Not quite there yet, but we're getting there. I'm going to make a new layer in between the background and everything else, but the layer an overlay and grab an airbrush. I want to experiment with like warming up the Sky just a little bit, actually maybe overlays in the right color. Be ready, just need to go right in and paint it on normal because it's already really great, but I want a little bit of a warmer Sky. You see the before and after 4 after. That works on the interest on it as well. Thanks. Like a good trick. So here's what I was talking about earlier regarding adjustment layers and things. I'm going to bring my layers pile out here so you can see 'cause I think it was going behind my. Webcam, so when I get to a certain point in the process, especially like basically near the end, I like to use adjustment layers to modify things a little bit and. Uh. Maybe tweak colors a little little bit before I paint the final details on. Thank you Jasper, thanks, appreciate that. I'm going to make a new layer and go to image, apply image and just this creates emerged version of everything below. So it's basically the Sky and everything else is together. So I'm going to use the adjustment layer. So I'm going to go to the half circle here and we can go through some of these and take a look at what we can do with them. So let's try levels first levels helps with your values, the darks and lights so you can go through shadows. Midtones and highlights and adjust the different brightnesses. Maybe you find that this can help push the mood more. Thank you, Papa Lowe's. Gaussian hi there. Sometimes I end up adding a little bit more contrast in this step. But it's just to play around with and I like to just play around with it and see if there's anything I can do to improve things. I also like to go through color balance. And go through The Shadows, Midtones and highlights, and just kind of play around. This is something that I do almost every time, whether I think the painting needs it or not. Sometimes you can find different ways to make it better. So do we want more of a green cast? What about more weapon genta? I think the magenta is more Moody, but you don't always have to change. You don't have to change anything. Blue and green. I prefer not to change anything there. Let's try midtones. The nice thing is that this is not destructive, it's on a separate. It's an adjustment layer so you can go back and either lower the opacity you can mask out these adjustments, or you can just get rid of them completely. You can tell them down, you don't have to. Be stuck with what you do here. Let's try highlights finally. Like look how different you can make this mood. I don't really like any of that anyway, but sometimes sometimes these can really save you if you're struggling to. You're struggling to. Get a certain mood. Sometimes you can find the answer here with adjustment layers. So after doing a bunch of stuff, I'll turn the layer on and off, so this is before, after, before, after, and see if I like the adjustment, 'cause sometimes I won't. In this case I'm going to lower the opacity of it and just have a little bit of a little bit of a showing through. This is before and after of those two little bit more. Contrast. And finally, selective color is something that I use a fair amount. It's super super powerful. When I first discovered slipped selective color, it kind of blew my mind so you can select your color here that you want to play with and basically go through these sliders and it's going to only alter the colors in this range like the Reds. So now I can decide, do I want more or less cyan in my reads in the Reds? Tone, so you can really, really change things. And then the magenta is. I mean, look at this difference. And this is without going back and re painting stuff and you can totally change the mood. So I like them or orange. So we're going to add some yellow. And then that you can change the values, darks and lights of this. So that feels good. So if I show the before and after there before after it's been more saturated and you can go through another selective color. Or you can do it all on the one layer. And you don't have to go through all these, but you know sometimes it's fun to do. It had more of a glow. What about the greens? I think playing with things like this can really really spark some creativity, because you maybe there's a color scheme that you wouldn't naturally think of. But through playing with these adjustment layers and things you can come up with something interesting and maybe yeah, maybe it opens you up to a new style even. Look at that. OK, so let's. Look at the before and after. I was kind of going through those really quickly so. Will keep a little bit of the adjustments, but we can. Move this layer up to see the before and after all of the adjustments so this. Yeah, this is before. Hold on, let me do this properly. Play image. Yeah, so this would be like before and after 4 after. It's actually not like a huge. Huge change. I've gone through more extreme changes with these, but it's definitely. Definitely bit warmer. So I'm going to get rid of the adjustment layers. Technically, you might want to keep those if you want the ability to paint in a non destructive manner. I just wanted to show how they worked. I don't really need to have all those layers around. Hi Rick, welcome welcome welcome. I'll put this back over here. So there's some other things that I like to do in the finishing steps. I make a new layer and put it on multiply and this isn't in every scene, but I think it'll work in this one. I'm going to choose a warm color, maybe this warm Brown or warm purple would actually be nice. And I'm going to use the airbrush to make sort of a vig net around the outside. Of the scene. Now this is a little bit too heavy, but I just wanted to be able to see what I was doing and show you guys, but I usually go pretty heavy on it and then erase out and lower the Opacity until it's like at a level that I like. So just a little bit like this, you really don't want it to look like you've done anything but it just kind of helps focus the viewers. I more towards the centre or more towards the focal areas rather than the outside so just darkening outside a little bit. And. The opposite would be bringing more light towards the. The focal area so we can put a layer on color Dodge. I'm going to double click. We're going to uncheck transparency shapes layer. If you uncheck this, it changes how color dog behaves just a little bit an I'd like the effect more. It's a little bit more saturated. I think it just effects the colors a little bit. All thank you Rick, thanks. So I want to choose a warm orangey yellow color and. We're going to put a nice Big Airbrush and put this glow behind the. Foliage on everything back there. And Yeah, it's over exposing a little bit. That's kind of what we get in the actual photo reference to. So before, after, before, after can lower the Opacity. If it's doing a little too much, it's kind of intense. We can also go for like a green. You want. Newer photo shop has a color wheel too. Yeah, that's right, that's right pablos. So I have um Coulouris extension, but if you have Photoshop CC 2019 or later or you know any more recent ones, you can go to window color and there is a color wheel here. So if you prefer it might be showing up as the Hue Cube, but if you go to this menu you can change it to color wheel. This was very nice for people like me that prefer the triangle. I still use color is because I've already paid for it and. It does have some extra features, gamut masks and things like that that are nice, but yeah, if you're looking just for the triangle color wheel, Photoshop has that now and it's I prefer it. I don't know. It's a personal preference thing. You know, some people still prefer the cube, but I like the color wheel. All right, so if we show the before and after this is before after of the vig net and the. The extra brightness behind the tree so it really changes where your eye focuses for me, I'm a less looking at the water and more looking towards the tree were not finished yet, but it's just interesting how those little changes can affect where your viewer is going to look in the scene, so it's nice to think about. But I want to go back in now and do some more painting. So. Let's look at. I actually have some brushes that I intended to be for the purpose of painting foliage and stuff like that, which I haven't even really used in this painting, and I'm not sure if it's like too late to bring him out, but I've got some that have. Some leave kind of leaf effects and things, and maybe at least in the foreground it could be nice to put in some of that. Some of these individual little. Shapes looking like leaves. Not sure if I like it, but let's do a little bit more. I like to use brushes like this to help with like these silhouettes. If I want the shape of these little individual leaves the pop out here, it's nice to have. Not have to paint every individual one. Fresh looks like this. We also have some leaves coming down from the top right here and I think I will probably. Maybe I'll paint these myself, or maybe we'll just block him in and then paint on top. It kind of works out. Bring a branch down. I like this because it makes it feel like you're really in the scene, doesn't it? Having this little branch come down? What's the story behind this work? Is it for a client or project? It's just a study, there's no. Nothing too interesting storywise behind it. Just a photo study. To show a just showing my process in digital painting. I do a lot of photos. Studies actually do this every Wednesday here, and I go through showing. Showing my process and talking through work workflow. And anybody is welcome to join in. I always share my references. Below that, the stream in the description, you can find the reference image and. We like to paint together to do some studies. So I want to add in with the. With that what I did with the brush here. I'm going to make selections. For individual leaves. Did you do any streams that Adobe live? No, no, I haven't just on my just here on on be hands. On my own channel. OK, so I'm making a selection for some more more leaves. I'd like to have some of them overlapping and I like the idea that summer little darker than others. The light shining through. Going to lock the transparency and dark in some of the other leaves so they kind of blend in more. I think we're getting there. Thanks Makaveli, nice the branch brings it back to the focal point. Yeah, the branch. Kind of Swoopes and inward a little bit. Although one thing I need to be careful of is I think the. The branch is a little bit more interesting in the reference because it has this nice little opening. Space in there, so we'll make sure we leave that in. Give some breathing room. Give some negative space. All thank you. Thanks Ryan. I I have to admit that a lot of that came from the color dynamics. Brushes were experimenting with that and going pretty intense with like letting the color dynamics effect work. And then I went back in and like did a little bit of my own thing on top. But I was really amazed how well it worked out with the colour dynamics. I turned off apply per tip and let it just change each brush stroke slightly was really fun. I will probably do it again. So right now we're kind of doing finishing touches and things, adding some last little. Textures. Yes, I am achin. I am from the US English. My first language. I'm living in the Netherlands now and I am learning Dutch but not well enough to stream this dream in it. But yeah, I think I will always dream in English anyway just because it's. Ability to. For I think I think for more viewers to understand. I know for a lot of you guys, English as a second language, so I really appreciate. Your effort to speak. Speak in English to me so we can hang out together and I'm as I'm learning a second language now. I really can appreciate it more. English is my first language. I'm going to put some little. Some more little breaks in the foliage here. Looking through to the Sky, although I think that brush might be a little bit too much. Will find something less intense. The only problem with making I'm making a. A new brush there right now. What other things that I find sometimes is I'm doing trial and error. I have a bunch of brushes that I'm not super familiar with yet, so I'm kind of like sorting through my brushes, trying to find the right one so. Sorry for that. Alright, so if anybody was if anybody was painting along, if you'd like to share your painting, you're welcome to post it in the chat. If you need more time to work on it, then no worries, you're welcome to take your time. Stream isn't over yet, and you can share it whenever you're ready. But I might be soon working, moving on to another painting. And leaving this one as finished. We could go on and on and on detailing this, but for me it was just meant to be a. Couple hour photo study and I think, thinking that time that I'm. Pretty ready to call it done. Um, do I am a full time streamer. I stream here and also on Twitch. And. I also sell my I'm a digital and traditional painter. I also saw my traditional paintings so basically just. Working working for myself at the moment. So if you guys painted along and you want to share, you can just post in the chat. You don't need any special permissions or anything. I'm just going to add a few more leaves here. I keep thinking I'm done and then seeing like one more thing I want to do. Typical. Oh that's OK. Clever, no worries. I think you also gotta. I had quite a Head Start before some of you have joined in, so no worries you take take your time. Thanks Rick. OK, well I will post this after stream. Well, maybe not immediately after stream but I will post this study. And I'll share my. Actually my Instagram is in the below the stream in the description, but I'll post in chat as well if that's more convenient. I post a lot of these studies on my Instagram and I also like to post them here on behalf, of course, but I kind of like to save my very best ones for big hands 'cause it's more of a portfolio for me, so we'll see if this one is going to make the cut or not, but I'll definitely post it on my Instagram and maybe I'll post it here too. But this, I think is finished for now. Thank you, Brad. Thank you. I wanna do one more painting Study together today. Also those of you who are going to share your work. Yeah, take your time. No rush. I'm going to take a very quick break to get some more water in between these paintings. So I've been talking a lot, but I'm going to. Paint next, I think something maybe something nice and green. Maybe next green waterfall if you guys want to stick around. If anybody came in during the stream and you're interested in to see a painting from the beginning, will be starting a new one from a blank canvas. Project I Madeon chat. This looks amazing. Hey project, thank you, thank you. Yeah this is a. This was really fun. What do you do? More paint with dynamic size or dynamic opacity? Dynamic size? Well actually both, but I've been leaning more and more towards opaque brushes rather than using a lot of transparency. But I do use both. Thank you I see us. Thanks Leandro, thanks for the nice comments. I'm going to take a very quick break. I will put on a slide show of some of my previous artworks so you can see those while I'm gone for like a couple minutes. Hi Jane, for anyone is coming in I'm sorry to leave you but I'll be back in a 2 minutes and we will begin anew painting so I hope you stick around and I'll see you soon. Hey guys, thank you very much for waiting for me. We're back to do some more painting, but let's see if I missed anything. Jackson Joker says beautiful worth Mattie. Here's my take alright, let's see. See what Jackson painted with us? Oh wow, this came out awesome. Check this out, you guys. Let me get this reference out of the way so we can see. That is beautiful. I absolutely love it. The tree and the mountain back here. Probably my favorite areas which works well. River coming back around. Yeah, it's a very nice composition and beautiful rendering. Hi Cody, welcome. This is a beautiful work by Jackson Joker in the chat. I like the dimension you gave to the foliage is really nice with the lighter green on top. Feels very 3D. Oh, I'm glad you painted with us. This is awesome. I really like and I like the style on the top left, top left mountain 2. Glove back on. And yeah, we're going to start and you painting. So let me grab a reference image. This is going to be something a little different. With intense lighting, so this is going to be. This is another reference from pixels, actually the other one from today was Unsplash. This is pixels and I will share the link. In chat and I will also post it. Um? I also post it below in the stream description, so give me one moment. Sorry for the way guys, I just need to update everything for people that want to paint along so you can find the reference. So the second image has been added below and. I'll also. Add it to the links above, the chat and the info panel. I'm going to add it there too. So. Do that. You saw this one. Yeah, when you showed me the waterfall you painted earlier that it reminded me of this kind of similar lighting. All right, so this is the next one. We're going to paint. Uploading my to be hands rushing. Don't brush clever. Take your time. It's totally fine unless you need to go or something, but stream isn't ending so you have time. There's no need to rush. OK, so let's do reference to. We're going to post. This in the. Info tab and then we should have everything updated. OK so if you guys wanted to grab that reference image you should be able to find it and description an info tab were good and I'm going to use pure ref to put a. Little thumbnail view appear. Move that over actually. I will move this one to the other monitor next to chat. Let's get a new canvas here. So the reference image size was 1500 by 2250 pixels. I'm going to make my painting a little bit bigger, just in case. Just in case. So go out about 4000 by 2500 pixels. Going to save this. Waterfall study. I JS. Alright, so I think we're set. If anybody has any questions or if you have any trouble finding the reference images, let me know and we'll make sure we fix it. But I will be talking through my process as we go here, and if you have any questions let me know. Will try to go step by step. So I think I will start with a sketch on this one. I usually I bake. I use a sketch like 8 out of 10 times. I use the sketch most of the time, but sometimes I don't. But I think I will for this one. It really helps me to plan out what I'm doing, so I'm just going to look at what's going on right here on this reference and try to match that as much as possible. And if anything. I'd like to try to simplify some of what's there, so that means you know looking for opportunities to stylize or simplify. If there's a lot of busy stuff going on, trying to pick out the most important thing and just focus on that. So, for example this branch. It's got a lot of little branches and Twigs coming out. But maybe just getting the main branch and picking a couple of the most important ones, that sort of a way to start I think. And then we can add more if needed and get into that kind of details. Yeah, yeah you can. There's a link in the description to my discord server, so you're welcome to join that if you like, and you can post. There are channels in there for sharing your art for sharing work in progress, things like that and. Then if you want to share, if you're painting along with these studies and you want to share, that's a place you can post your image and then take the URL and post it in the chat. You can't post images directly from your PC into the chat, but you can upload them to somewhere like discord or any social media site, and then put the link in chat and that should work fine. So we've got a pretty big like Boulder up here and then these Little Rock, so a way of simplifying. I'm looking at these. These are actually two rocks, but starting with one line. To start breaking that up and then we can kind of divide them up within that. OK, let's see clever joined us for the last one. Is loading slowly for me for some reason there we go alright. Check this out guys. This is from clever. Beautiful colors. I'm a big fan of this warm. Like Would you call this almost almost like burnt Sienna? Kind of color? Nice atmospheric perspective. The lighter mountain in the background. Very pretty clever. I know you did this super fast because you started halfway when I was already halfway done so. Nice work, thank you for joining. It's it's very nice to have company with these studies. Oh cool pablos. I wish I knew how to do that also. Well good luck with your with your fonts. Yeah, you're always welcome to join in the future. So now I'm dividing up this these rocks into. But two different ones, but starting out just with that one gesture. And it's nice to be able to move the stuff around. It's part of the reason I like to keep my sketches on multiple layers at the beginning, like if I have one rock and I have a tree in front. I'm going to keep the tree on a separate layer 'cause it can easily move these things around. And then. Merge them at the end. Fresco has a time-lapse, cool, awesome so the one that we just looked at on the artwork from clever in the chat was done in Frisco. You can check out clevers page if you want to see it. Did you also upload the time lapse to your page? I love that it automatically that can automatically save a time lapse like that. It would be awesome if Photoshop has that in the future too. That would be very happy. Alright, so I'm kind of trying to pull out the interesting angles that I'm seeing here. Got this little area, the waterfall pouring out. Coming down like this. Not a proper font. You can't type with. It basically shapes that are letters only to be used for headlines. That's cool. I do I have a Wakeham Centriq 22. That's the model. Of my tablet. Alright, so I'm going to merge these layers so we've got our sketch and I think I gave a little bit of more space. Yeah, let's go. Let's give a little bit. Like that? Interested to see how you paint the waterfall, thanks. Well I will try to do something good. I like the house splashy, it is, there's a lot of water droplets and it's pretty like it's got a nice like little explosion so this is different than a lot of watercolors that waterfalls that I painted before that have been more at a distance. And you get that big stream. So I think this is cool. I'm going to put my layer on, multiply an lower the opacity that will make it easier to see through my sketch as we're painting below and anywhere between 20 and 30%. Usually opacity, and then I'll lock the layer so I can paint underneath and I don't accidentally paint on this layer because yeah, that happens. It happens to us also if you lock the layer, it's less likely to paint on it, so. Let's let's begin, so I'm going to take a little. Trick I guess from traditional painting and use a an underpainting this color this kind of warm color is very popular to use for under paintings in traditional. That's what I was talking about with this sort of burnt Sienna color. So I'm just going to pretend this is like a bill canvas. Paint the whole background in. This is nice 'cause it gets rid of the white. I don't know about you guys, but I hate painting when there's a white on the canvas. It's hard for me to visualize the lights and darks in the scene, so. Um? This will be a good. Start. And then we can actually add a little bit of shading if you want to kind of think through the what the values are going to be like in the scene. It's a lot of rim light at the top and then shadows, so I'm a big fan. I love this kind of lighting. Light shining through the greens so we've got something roughly like this going on. I'm sorry, foster yeah. I hope your Internet fixed to this is not a time when you want to have Internet problems, but I'm glad you were able to at least paint with us despite it. This is our background, so we're going to make a new layer an now start painting on top of this. And. Let's have some fun with brushes. I might try some some different textures and things. I'm going to go with a real bright green appear. Well, that's that's a little too much. That's a little brighter like I wanted a bright green, but let's not put that one. Let's try something like a little bit more natural feeling. So OK, I'm not going to worry about painting over the branch and all that stuff. We're going to paint the branch on top. This is just starting back to front. So I will turn on color dynamics. We really liked this last time it was fun, so I'm going to uncheck apply protip so each brush stroke that I make, it's going to slightly alter the color based on the amount of Hue, saturation and brightness jitter that I chose there, so. Do use a mouse for painting high badanai. Use a tablet, a screen tablet. So my model is the Wakeham Centriq 22, so it's I'm using this stylus to draw on the screen. But there's a lot of different types of tablets out there. If you're looking for information. If you type actually, you know what I'm giving you. Yeah, I'm going in autopilot here. Let me let me paste the link in the chat for what I wanted to share. This page. Uh. That I just posted in the chat that will have a section about tablets and some links to some different blogs with information and things like that. If you're looking to get into it and you need some guidance on what kind of tablet to get, there's a lot of information there. You don't have to jump in and get the same type of tablet I have. It's a little bit more of a high end one, but there's a lot of good tablets out there that are in all different price ranges so. You can check that out if you're interested. All right, so we've got a background starting very abstract at the moment, but it's really fun to paint this way. It's very like for me, it's very relaxing. Van live logs highbar welcome. Book login. Let's go to a darker color. I'm looking at this color here. It looks almost black, but we're going to go a little bit more like Purples and Browns and Blues. I try to stay away from using pure black in my painting and find other colors that might be suitable and give a stronger mood sense of mood. So we can start with. That and then this rock has a lot of Grays and. Purples and greens. Oh, thank you. You are a all that makes me really happy I am. I'm very excited to finally share it. Trying to speed that process along, but my guess is it's probably going to be another. It might be another few weeks just being totally realistic, but I I hope that. Like around a month from now, it will be. It will be out. That's that's my goal. So I'm going to try to make that happen. But there's there's certain there's a couple of effects yet that I haven't created a good brush for, and I want it to be like well rounded, so I'm still working on that. But thank you for saying that. Right, so blocking in this over on the left. If you are struggling at all, picking your colors is OK to color pic from the reference and see what the real color is. Sometimes that can help provide some clarity. Um? So if I color pick, this is the actual color of what's going on over there. Thanks, Sarah, thank you. But we don't have to paint everything exactly like the reference. Of course we can put a little bit of our own taste into it. So I tend to like to start with the mid tones and then move on to shadows and highlights. So this scene there's not a ton of Midtones. Comparatively speaking, there's everything is like pretty dark, and then there's pretty bright areas. It's like very high contrast, so it didn't take long to move on to the step of adding these darker areas. There's a really cool glow kind of affect coming up from the water down here. So right now I'm sticking with one brush in the last painting I kind of did the same thing like it went through the early stages of blocking and everything, just with one brush. It's kind of nice to move fast and go through the painting and not worry about changing brushes a million times. And anyway, we're painting pretty large right now. When we get into little specific textures, we might look at nuances of. Brushes more, but right now we're just kind of walking in. So I'm going to put a little bit of. Color on some of these areas that are going to have a. A bright Papa flight come in soon. I'm still going to give them some color now and try to cover up that underpainting and we're going to lighten him up from here. But dark to light is what we're doing. If it helps, while you guys are doing studies, photo studies and things, I really recommend checking your values as you go, like turning your painting into black-and-white. This is something that I try to do as I go. I didn't do it that much on the last painting. I probably should have done it more, but you can do the same with your reference and with the painting and that really help you see where things are going well and where they can improve. So if you feel like you can't figure something out with your study. Change it into black and white and I can show you a shortcut for that. You do have to set it up so this isn't a default shortcut in Photoshop, but it's super handy, so it's like worth setting it up if you go to view. Proof set up custom. Click that and then under the proof conditions under the device to simulate, you just want to select working Gray gained 20% from the drop from the huge drop down. Yeah, so you select working Gray dot gain 20% and press OK and then anytime that you press CTRL Y it's going to turn into your painting into black-and-white. Once you've done that one time, so then you should be good to go. And the great thing about this is you can actually color pic and paint while you're in this mode. So while you're looking at values only, you can still you can still paint. And you can still color pic from the real. The real colors in your painting and paint this way, and it's super handy. So. If you get stuck, there have been times where this is saved. A painting for me like things really weren't working. I couldn't figure it out and I turned into black and white and I just painted like this for awhile, just not even considering color. Just trying to make the values work. And then turn it back. And suddenly I was in a lot better situation. Oh, thank you, Johnny, thank you for saying that and for hanging out with us. I appreciate the company. Hope you're all doing well. Alright, I think I will be brave and merge this stuff down now. You don't have to merge now, but I like to do. It makes me feel like OK, we're moving on to the next step. It's like more definitive so I'm going to merge and then just make a new layer and keep going. So let's work on down here. The water needs a little more love. So it's a little darker, of course around the outside outside here and then in towards where the waterfall is crashing down. There's just nice flash of light. It works out beautifully. It's really, really nice photo. Nor for proof of the news that stream that during my University project. Whoops, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to be about influence. But thanks for hanging out with this. OK I am like ansi to start putting highlights in here. I don't know about you guys. I'm I like to go in like an orderly fashion with my workflow, so I'm. Trying to hold off a little bit more, build our way up to those highlights, but I'm like ready. OK, let's just let's just do it. So a new layer. And I might actually finally switched to a different brush. Again, I'm testing out these brushes so bear with me if I have to trial and error a little bit which one I want to use the situation? This one will be good. But I want to pick a nice bright color for the rock up. Here we're going to get. Um, some bright bright light shining right on it. So I brush that has a little bit textures cool because that'll help give the look of texture on the rock. When you're painting. And you want to kind of minimize the amount of work, but get a big affect. You can, instead of texturing everywhere, you can focus your areas of texture in areas of high contrast in your work. So anytime that you've got this really intense. Follow my sketch. You've got these really intense areas of highlight. And shadow next to each other that's creating intense contrast. So let's just look at the reference really quick as I'll show you what I mean over here. This rock all has texture, of course. It's all textured down here, but it's really dark and there's not a lot of contrast. It's kind of hard to see the texture, but the texture is really obvious right here, like you can really get the feeling for the what that rock would feel like if you touched it, and that's because of the way the light is hitting and all these little grooves are getting illuminated in the shadows, and so, yeah. Of the textures, like very, very obvious. So you can like for example in this scene we can put a lot of details in that area and it's going to be nice and interesting. And then the rest of the scene with the areas of the rock. We don't have to like go quite as detailed as this, and your brain kind of fills in the textures elsewhere, which is super nice. Thanks, Norbert, thank you. So it's nice for a quick study, but also depending on your style, 'cause some people are more into more realistic styles and then Kate. In that case they might go. Forward with more texturing anyway, but if you're trying to kind of capture something a little bit more simply, then. But there's something to note. So you get a little bit more of the this Moss on the rock over here. Coming down. Across this area. And I think over here on the left we also have some. And it's very much in shadow back here and maybe even go a little bit more towards blue. Desaturate. It's not in the light, so we're not going to get those really really bright saturated greens. Are using a pad to paint. I am using a screen tablet so it's not one of the pads that's like where your mouse pad would be and then looking up at the monitor. It's like I'm drawing actually right on the screen. That's the style tablet that I have. It's the model. I'll type it in the chat. It's the rock com centriq 22. The one that I have. OK. But for anybody looking to get into this, I just want to keep stressing this 'cause. There's a lot of different styles of tablet out there, and there's a lot of. A lot of different different price range tablets so. Don't be alarmed if you look up the Sintec 22 because it's a little bit of. It's a little bit more pricey, although realistically I Salat. It's a lot they've come down in price from what they used to be so. I'm happy with my tablet and the quality of it and everything not necessarily complaining. But I'm just saying I don't want anyone to look up that tablet and think that's that's what you need to spend to get into Digital Art. 'cause That's not true. Both answers which photos did did you use for drawing when you are a beginner? I mean the images with minimal amount of shadows, textures etc. That's a good question. Well, let me post some information in the chat for you really quick I think. So I think you'll have to kind of use your own decision-making on what is going to be difficult or easy for you, 'cause for each person some subjects might be easier, another you know what I mean, something that might be difficult for me might be easier for you depending on what you like and what your experiences, but you can browse for images. Also give you some websites. Bees websites here. Thank you, Kenny. Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay and Workfile. They all have free to use images, so you're like safe to make studies of those and post them. You can even make prints of your work from them, and it's free to use images so that I always kind of recommend those, and you can browse through and just try to find something simple without too much crazy detail, you know, and you'll know, I think when you're looking at something, if it if you feel like it's a little too overwhelming, and then maybe look for something more simple, I can show you another website that I also use a ton and I know. Not the only one. I love using map crunch to find things to paint. You have to do it a little bit more of like a treasure hunt on here. So basically this website. Takes images from Google Street View Car and it will give you a random view whenever you click go and so it'll be anywhere in the world and look. I mean I think this is really pretty. Just the beautiful clouds and light Rays and tree shapes and everything. I mean, it's just the side of the road, but you find all these really pretty areas and they're nice to practice. And it's literally endless 'cause it's like. How many places in the world the Google Street View car has been and it's quite a lot. So you can just click go and you get random place. So if you want to find a specific type of environment to paint, you can click the options here and select a certain country like if you're looking for something tropical or snowy or whatever, you can find a place like this. You can also click map and then you can drag and drop. Like this and you'll end up. You know, getting different places based on where you drop a little little person so you can find places this way, and sometimes they're more complicated than others, so again, you just gotta be careful. I'll post the link to this in the chat too. And if you guys are looking for this kind of thing, it's called Virtual Plein air painting, and there's a lot of artists doing this. Like I said, I didn't invent that. I love doing it, but I'll put. I'll type in the chat. It's called Virtual Plein Air Painting. This whole idea of the Google Street View images and studying those. Thanks Sarah. Yeah, if you look on social media for like virtual pleinair tag hashtag, go find so many good artists like I love following that hashtag because it's really fun to see what people post under it. And. Yeah, so that's a recommendation in my discord server we have a channel for Virtual Plein air, so. There's a lot of people posting good images that they find in the in that. Channel, so I'm going to post a link to my discord server in the chat. There's also one below in the stream description, so if you are looking for some Anuar having bad luck because sometimes you get a bunch of good scenes when you use map crunch and other times you get like the boring side of the road and it you know there's nothing there. So it depends like there's some days that are hit or miss on if you're going to find anything good, but my communities been like posting in the discord whenever we find a good spot. So if you want to just browse through those rather than searching for hours on map crunch, you can. Find a bunch of that way too, so you can just scroll up through the channel in discord to find them. But I love to paint from those. A lot of what I've done here on behalf has been virtual plane errors painting not all the streams today we're doing or painting right from photos, but I often use the Google Street View Photos. I just didn't find anything this morning I was planning what to paint today and I'm I wasn't feeling it. So I picked some photos that I really liked. Alright, so I want some more variety in the greens up here sort of background so it looks like the yellow green is concentrated a little bit more up here at the top. So again, I'm painting pretty abstract for the moment. Things are going to get a little bit more crisp when some of these darker leaves come and hang down in front of this background, then will start making them a little bit more precise leaf shapes, but right now we're just getting a backdrop. And we can go a little bit more gradient. Down into. Like a blue green. So I want to show you something if you have the situation where you're painting mostly on one layer, like for example I don't have these rocks on a separate layer from the background it's altogether, but if you want to paint within the just the background, one thing you can do is just take a lasso tool like this and trace over the area that you want to paint within. And then it's very simple to then take your brush and kind of go like this and you don't have to worry about painting in the lines. I don't have to worry about accidentally going and painting over top of the rock cycle. Paint nice and free like this, almost as if it was on. Did you know separate layer so that's part of the reason that I feel comfortable merging so often is like there's lots of different ways with the tools that you can still work around things even with having the merged. Hello is love a picture? Reminds me of a place that was near my home when I was growing up. We would go swimming there all that sounds beautiful. I'm glad you like it. Thank you. It's good to see you usually paint with one brush or swap around. I usually swap around quite a bit but not at the very beginning. That's a good question. I usually start off with one brush for awhile when I'm blocking in like the basic shapes and then when I get into more details and different textures then I will use different brushes but usually at the beginning one brush for awhile. It always feels faster when you're just using one brush, but eventually I will start switching switching around. Probably soon. So I want to work on this transition between the purple black dark shadows on the Rock and transitioning up into the Midtones and highlights. I haven't really sorted that one out yet. I feel like there's some kind of color that I'm missing here. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you. I really appreciate it. OK, I think I will start with the tree up top now so will make a new layer for that because it is going to be right on top of everything else and I want my little feeling of security that it's. Not painted right on the layer we will merge it down once I feel like I like what I've done but will try it out like this first. Separate layer. So it reshaped going across the top. The nice thing about keeping this on a separate layer is you can use things like the luck. Transparency Hi Eric, I'm doing good thanks. How are you? I'm enjoying the painting today. I can give a quick peek for you and anyone who is just coming in now. We did one other painting before starting this one and this was the previous one. So if if later anybody wants to go back and watch the video to see this, this was the first one that we did. Now we're doing a watercolor scene. Kind of my favorite thing to paint. Especially with all these grass isn't. OK, so we have this tree on its own layer. I'm going to press the lock transparency tool up here. So that means that anything that I paint is only going to allow me to paint with a metry layer. Um? Like this watch appearance, how can I get it? Oh, are you talking about the cooler is here so if you look asthma if you look below my description the stream description there's a link to Coulouris and there's also a discount code and that's how you would get the color wheel coulouris color wheel if you do have Photoshop CC 2019 or later, you can go to window color and you will have a similar color wheel. It doesn't have all of the features of colors, but it is. So triangle color wheel format, so if that's what you're looking for, Photoshop CC 2019 and later already has this. So you can just just go from the Hue Cuban search bound to color wheel and you'll find it. Yeah, I like the color wheel to the triangle one. Hey ODI, I hope you're doing well. Thank you very much, Eric, I appreciate that. So I want to get this nice green look at look at that green light on the branch. It's like there's so much light shining through all of these leaves that it's creating this green glow. So again, because my layer is locked, I can just paint within that shape of the. The The Tree and it's like I don't even have to worry about painting in the lines. It's super easy. To paint it within the shape. So love it, love to use that with stuff like this. And maybe we could throw a little bit of a bounce light on the bottom. I don't see it strongly in the reference, but it just feels like it should be there. To me I'm going to put a little bit of light. I feel like there's a lot of light bouncing off of this area and to me it just feels like it might be nice for the tree to have a little bit of that light up here. Oh yeah, no problem asthma. Yeah, so we're going to go with that and then I will check the lock transparency. So that way I can now paint outside of the lines of that tree and let's. Let's add some branches so we have him. In this sketch there's some branches coming down here. And this one comes all the way down and we can think about like we don't have to paint everything exactly like it is in the reference. If we find that something else might be better for the composition, we can go with that. Like maybe it would look better to have a little broken. To have a little broken piece here. Aiming down and still within this negative space. We can have some others. Coming off too. Some other branches. You can experiment with this. It's a separate layer from the background, so we have a bit of freedom. And there's also branches coming up, so I might make a layer below 'cause it's it easier way to put this branch right behind, so this branch will be coming up like this. And we're going to Add all kinds of leaves too, so the branches are just. I like to do them first because I don't know. It seems logical to me. I can't figure out where the leaves are going to go until I pick it. Put the branches I like to do like the skeleton of the tree 1st and then add onto that. Let's put another little one out here. Another thing I struggle with sometimes when painting natural things is accidentally making them too perfect. You know what I mean? Like matching the shapes of the branches to each other too much. I want to try to force myself to put like some twigs going in the opposite direction. You know sometimes it looks a lot more natural if you don't have everything matching everything perfect, because in nature it doesn't look like that, and sometimes even in you have to change something from the reference. Sometimes even the reference looks too perfect groups would I press. Press to random shortcut key. OK, so we've got these altogether. I think I can turn off my sketch layer now that was the tree was like the last thing that was missing from the sketch. I think. Well, we have to still painting the waterfall, but. Other than that, so I think will will do that, so I'm going to go make a new layer underneath of the tree and work on Darkening some of these areas. Right now the tree looks like it's awkwardly floating, but if we put some more shadows here, the trees coming close to these rocks and creating a pretty dark shadow there, and so that's going to feel more like it's going to make more sense to be dark in these areas. Just like the reference were just looking over here, let's see what to do. And same thing over here, there's a lot of leaves that are going to hang down, but I haven't painted in yet. So we can kind of paint in some abstract. Green up here, but the idea is we just want more. Shadows up here. And I think that's OK for now. I'm trying to think what I should maybe I should block in at least block in the waterfall and then work upon the foliage more. Want to keep painting the tree, but I feel like I don't want to let the waterfall go too too long before we add it. I try to remind myself to like work around the scene and not take any one area to a very finished place while the other areas need a lot of work. I think it. I've noticed that I have better results when I work this way. I used to really focus in on one little area and make it super detailed and then go to the next area in the next area and I feel like I've gotten better results with my work when it kind of forced myself out of that pattern and try to move around more evenly. Like spend some time in one area and then leave it move to another area, work on that area. And just keep working around until everything comes to a finished place, like roughly at the same time as much as possible. So we'll add the waterfall. Right now I'm just working on the rock that the the waterfalls cascading over, so I'm going to. Fix up this area 1st and then we'll add the water. Not exactly sure how I'm going to do that either. Hum. Because I've been making a lot of brushes and there might be some but that work well for this. If you look at the reference, you'll see that the water is not really white, but more like a shadowy blue color or something like. This may be a little bit more more blue. Yeah, so we get a color like this and then we'll add little white highlights, but it's very blue and sometimes you have to even color pic to really see like I've painted a lot of waterfalls so I've started to see this pattern, but. It's really a Gray blue, and it's not too bright at all really, and then some of these really, really bright spots appear will be super bright, so we want to save these bright areas for where we want that most affect splash of light. So we gotta keep these pretty dark so that that area can stand out. So that's the plan. But what? But what brush? Hey Matthew are welcome. I'm doing this on a separate layer so I can erase out if I don't like what I do. Have that problem to find it hard not to get too focused on details too early. Ohmygosh that was such a big thing for me and I still have to like consciously work against doing that. But one of the things that helped was staying zoomed out. I don't know if this is something that you already do, but. That's like the biggest thing that helped me was like forcing myself not to zoom in too much. 'cause then you like you can't? There's only so many details you can do if you stay at like a full view of your image. So that was like my. My trick through help avoid doing that 'cause I had no self control like I had to find a way to just not allow myself to do it and that was the so just don't seem in there you go well until the end and then you can zoom in. OK so I got this brush with some crazy texture. I'm trying to use to make some splashes. Also erasing back in towards that texture so that can be a nice way to get some interesting effects so painting and then erasing with a different texture brush. So I think that's nice because the splash effect here has like a lot of random little spaces in between the droplets and stuff. So. I try not to zoom in too much, but then I still want to do details so subconsciously make my brush really small. You like painting with a one pixel brush like I'm not zoomed in. It doesn't count. Hey, that's alright. I think as long as you're thinking about it and making an effort that's better than than nothing. Just letting yourself go on autopilot. I think that's like just one of the biggest things with art. And with getting better, probably even outside of Art. But like anything that you're trying to improve on is like keeping that that you're staying conscious with what you're doing. Instead of like kind of going into autopilot. Yeah, I hope it helps if anybody, if anybody tries that out. I'm going to test out a couple different brushes, 'cause I'm still not happy with how the waterfall is looking and I'm trying to create a brush set that's going to give. It's going to give a wider range of like help with different textures, so I made a brush that was supposed to work for this kind of thing. I guess we can try it out. You got the color wheel also nice. I really hope you enjoy it. I hope. I hope it helps. Makes things a little easier color picking wise. So this brush is. Emulating like a splatter texture. The traditional splatter texture I actually used my watercolors and Gouache paints to make a bunch of splatters. And then I scanned them and that's how I made this a brush so it's really from traditional textures. Trying to make it work here. So far. I think I might start again. With the waterfall. But that's why we do it on this upper layer. Nice on, I'm really glad you like them. Thanks for saying so. Enjoy. So I think this brushes and ice was the word like compliment. I don't think this is going to paint the whole waterfall, but I think if we want to add a little extra splatters onto it this would be nice for that purpose. But I still gotta find. How to paint this? The main shape of it. Yeah, this is nice for a little extra splatter, but it's not doing not going to do it all. OK, so let's get rid of the other layer. And I will turn that one off too. And. Let's try this one. Thank you for the next comments you guys and thanks for being patient. Will figure out how to how to do this. That's a painting. There's a lot of trial and error so. And tried different eraser. We basically we want to get that effect of the water being more together as it's about to Cascade over the waterfall and then kind of. Falling apart kind of all these little space is coming between there and just kind of tumbling over. I like these kind of like Kris Kross. Affects that I'm seeing. It's because of the water, the water, the properties of water, the water tension, like little droplets, are kind of trying to stick to each other, even as they're falling down. So. And we've got water coming over the rock here, and it's very much. And shadow, we get these purple Blues in the area. Back here is going to have a bright light hitting. I think it's going to be nice. Let's start getting some of that color in. It would be satisfying. Funny facts first ever. Photo shop had only one undo. Oh, that's definitely hard mode. Only one control Z. What are so hard to paint it is it is really hard to paint and I love painting it but. I also find it difficult. Uh-huh Yeah, I will be painting the bright spot. I tend to douche midtones then. Shadows and highlights. So sometimes the highlights come like as the last step. So. We will get there. Do use the dropper. Told the sample colors from reference photos I don't. I also don't have a problem with people doing it or think it's like sometimes people have strong opinion on this and think that you shouldn't do it. I personally don't think it's a problem to do it necessarily, but the reason I don't do it is because I'm trying to practice. Picking my own colors and I want more freedom. Like when I first started doing digital painting, I had to really color pic from the photos because I couldn't choose my own colors. I just they were totally off when I would try to do it an after doing a lot of these studies an. Practicing just looking at the color and trying to select it for myself, I slowly got better with that and I feel a lot more freedom in my painting now like I can choose my own colors. It helps me understand color theory better and it's just been more fun by project. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks for hanging out. So yeah, I tried to not call her pick from the reference just for my own. Just to get better at choosing the colours myself, and it's definitely been beneficial, is like feel like I can paint a lot faster now. Because of that. And less restricted love digital painting too. Yeah I do. I love digital painting and I also love traditional painting. I get a lot of questions about like which one do I like best and I find it really, really hard to pick because I really like I really like both and I would never want to give up either. And I like doing both 'cause I feel like it kind of. I get inspiration from one and I want to try things in the other. It's part of the reason that my I've been going for this really traditional work in my digital paintings from Thanksgiving traditional painting and then kind of falling in love with that. Wanting those textures here. I'm going to go back to my original brush that I was using to paint this whole scene to begin with. Think that'll help me give me more consistency. And here's a bright. Here's the bright spot. Well, one of the bright spots we were waiting for. That should help. We're going to add a bunch of little shines and things here, so it'll be almost pireway for those. Is there somewhere we can use your brushes in illustrator? I don't think so unfortunately on, but I I don't use illustrator. I don't have a lot of knowledge about how it works or if you can use the brushes in there, but to my knowledge I don't think you can use Photoshop brushes in illustrator, but maybe. I'm wrong, anybody can correct me, but I don't think you can. All thank you asthma. Well if you have any questions, you're welcome to ask me. I'm happy if I can answer them. I don't know all the answers. As with songs question, I'm sorry, but I know more with photo shop then the other programs I've used illustrator along time ago. But it really was a while ago. And I don't remember a lot. It was very briefly. So right now I'm painting these highlights, hitting the side of the rock over here. Remember lights coming from the back shining through these areas are getting a lot of bright. Pops of light and I'm a big fan of how this how the green is bright green looks when the lights shining on it and love that color. It's very lively. Here too. Little little bit so far. Plants, analogy and all kinds of stuff. Growing here. So we still have that other layer, that splash layer will see if we end up using that. How do you keep the reference photo of you on photo shop? Well, that's a good question, so it's not part of Photoshop. This is a separate. Um? App or program and let me get the link to it. It's called pure ref. Is very popular actually for. Organizing reference images and making like mood boards and reference sheets and stuff. All at it below the stream in the description. But yeah, it's called pure if you can download it for free. I think that they leave it up to you if you want to make a donation or not when you download the program, so you can choose to do that if you want, but I think you can download it for free. Ah, thanks Sarah, you're welcome. I try. I tried to organise them like the more brushes you have, the more you need to organize them or else you can never find anything. Thank you. Alright, little down over here. Rock as well as the. Green And put some. Put some little noisy texture on this too. Bright greens And appear too can be a little later, I think. So we went from using the same brush for quite a lot of this too. Now I'm like trying every brush trying to figure out what nice little textures we can get in. It's not necessarily super efficient to do this, but when you are trying to get that look at traditional look. Sometimes you gotta mess around with these different textures. Hi Gary. Thank you, thank you very much. I'm glad you're enjoying the stream. I will post a link in chat for you. This is a blog that talks a lot about different tablets in different price ranges and. Their screen, tablets, and. Regular tablets and all kinds of things. I find it difficult to recommend 1 tablet for anyone because there's so many things regarding your individual budget and stuff that can come into play and how much you think that you would prefer screen tablet versus a regular tablet. But check out that link. Um, if you're looking for a screen tablet, the. The the some of the less expensive ones would be XP pen and Huey and I've heard good things about them. I'm using a welcome which is which I love, but it's a little bit more expensive, so if you're just starting I would say. If you're looking for, if you want the quality of welcome, you could try an intuos or something like that. Those are there types that don't have a screen, but they have great pressure sensitivity. And. Yeah, it's just. It's really hard to pick a tablet for someone because there's so many little things to consider, but I hope that that blog helps you make a more informed decision. Jackson says, not sure how to tackle the leaves while keeping the painting kind of loose. You have some plans for that. Not yet, but the previous painting. This area, I think worked out pretty well so. Maybe I'll do a combination of a brush and then some selections. Basically the way the leaves look here, I think I'd be pretty happy with something similar to that on this one. So maybe a brush? To start with and then some individual painted leaves on top to like clean up a couple. Where do you find your reference photos? I will post in the chat. Pexels, unsplash, pixabay, word file. These are the most mostly the ones that I use. Haley arts and good morning. Like you're hearing on tablets. Thanks for Chiming in. Those of you who have different tablets and. Have an opinion one way or the other toys? Nice to share. We've had this conversation a couple of times today and don't feel bad about asking. Important question when you're first getting into stuff. If you look below the stream in the description, there's a link it says resources page or resources that also has a bunch of links to tablet related information beyond just the. The one that I posted in the chat, so there's more stuff there, as well as just general tutorials and things. Hi Gina, I am. I'm using the Centriq 22. The welcome Cindy 22 is the tablet that I have. So that is a screen tablet. Alright, maybe we should, uh, paint. Some of those leaves soon. I want to work on the waterfall a little bit more because I feel like I'm still still haven't figured that out yet. Can you show how you draw? Yeah, just hang out and watch. That's what I've been doing. If you want to see from the beginning. I started this from a blank white canvas, so after the stream it usually takes a couple hours for the stream to process and then it's available. If you go to my profile and click the videos tab, you can watch any of my past livestreams there and I always start from a blank canvas and show the whole painting process as I create something and I try to explain as I go. So if you want to watch any of those then yeah then you can see. Unless you're asking like to see my tablet like maybe if that's what you're saying when you say show you trying to see the tablet since we're talking about tablets. I don't have an easy way of doing it without disrupting my whole camera setup, so I'm sorry I do have. If you look at my Instagram link below the description. Of the stream, if you Scroll down quite a bit on my Instagram, there is a photo of my setup so you can get an idea of what it looks like. But I don't have an easy way of showing it right now without messing up everything. I need to take a new picture. 4. For that purpose soon it's been awhile. But yeah, I'll just type it in the chat. what I have. So if you look it up you know you'll see what it looks like. Yeah, no worries. This is getting a little little muddy in the waterfall area here, but. We will. Continue anyway. Trying to figure it out. So I think having vertical strokes is important to look like it's falling down. Give the effect of gravity, but then we also want little splash effects coming off. Thank you, Maarten. Thank you very much. I think this one is maybe going to be my favorite from today actually, just. I can figure out what to do with the waterfall. Then I'll be happy. But hey, that's what we do studies for so we can studies are basically like troubleshooting. There's always going to be something that you can't figure out how to do, and you've got to try a bunch of different methods and then eventually you get it, and then that was the point. That was the point, right? Those appointed doing studies, although it's always nice when everything goes smoothly, but I think you learn the most when you have these kind of moments and you have to. Try things out. Thanks, Shama, that's that's what I'm trying. I'm trying to go for that. In the past my style was a little bit more realistic I guess. But I I really love the idea of just capturing the mood of a scene instead of painting it super super realistically. So I've been trying to work on that even though my natural tendencies are to just like copy the reference. But I've been trying to to avoid just copying the reference. Try to put a little bit of my own style into it. All right, so we've got the waterfall tumbling over from the side. How many waterfalls sounds refreshing? It is going to be refreshing, I hope. Try out those splatter brushes when were time. I've got some. Brushes that might work that have little dots, textures and things. We'll see. Got some splatters. Works pretty well. Oh thank you mother ship. Thank you. Hear that. Yeah, this splatter brushes nice. The waterfall is really splashing alot like it's very Misty and. Splash explosion, sometimes in waterfalls. The water is like one thick stream, but this one is very splashy, so I want to get that look. That's what the speed sketches are for. Oftentimes a technique is stumbled upon that can create certain texture for another project exactly exactly. It's always a good feeling when you find something like that. Thanks Julie and enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks for hanging out with us. Have to get back to work. This is my learning lunch break. Really enjoyed watching and learning from you. Will def watch rest later. Also I'm thanks Sarah. I really appreciate the kind words and the company enjoy the rest of your day. And we'll see you later. For anybody who is knew, I stream every Wednesday at the same time. So also you can find me back here. Be hands next Wednesday as well. Love the energy of the slashes. Yes, yes, thank you. I'm trying to get that started off. Little bit of struggle, but we're getting there getting there Hiriko, I'm going to flip the canvas. I think it's been too long from one side and this might help. This might refresh our view a little bit. Let's flip it. Hi Bernadette, thank you. Thank you. I think having a little bit of. Painting the water and then painting the background color back in is helping to make things not so precise and a little bit more chaotic. 'cause That's the big thing that's hard to capture about this. This waterfall is like there's a lot of little. It's a little bit chaotic, but you still have gravity pulling it down in. There's some kind of order. Not much of a balance. Ha ha ha. Hey Gary and thanks for coming over welcome. Yeah, so paint in and then paint over it would be kind of the same idea if you're erasing out. So the idea is creating a shape with the brush and then kind of cutting back into that shape. To change it up a little bit. And these little spaces in between the water. Not quite there yet. There's also these little like they're kind of connected these little. Crisscross openings It's not important effect is having these enclosed little circles. Maggie Valley says I can easily imagine some fantasy adventure characters approaching the waterfall, as if there's something magical about it. Cat Biggs I think. I think the like bright light up here helps 'cause like you get that a lot in games and movies when there's like a magical something magical about that. Whatever it is, it's going to have that nice Mr. Gold glow. The light perfectly hitting it. Get that idea. OK, well I think I actually like that enough to merge it down and say, OK, we're going. We're going somewhere. New layer I want to add this splash down here where the water was hitting the water. This. So we're going to do the same thing and start with a like a blue. Color this is basically what the water looks like in Shadow, and then we're going to add. Some highlights. So we'll add the bright, almost white. Thanks Makaveli. I'm really glad this one so. Turning out well. Another thing that you can do is since we've got this on its own layer right now, we can lock the layer and we can. Paint inside of that with a different brush so we can really. Bring it up with something softer. I think that might be a nice look. Got a little bit darker. Below here. We have some really warm greens in the water here. Oh Pablos, that's so nice of you, really. Yeah, it should take only like 10 minutes for you to be allowed to post in there. Thank you. Made a quick many design with the font. I mean that's awesome. Well I'm excited to see it when it when it allows you to post. Had some great greens, little little splashes of color in here. There's actually a lot of little ripples catching the light. Not sure if there's a way for me to kind of indicate that without painting at all, 'cause it seems like a lot. I want to see. Alright, let's leave the waterfall for a little bit and work on the top, because like I said earlier, I'm going to try not to go too detailed on any part of the scene. While other areas are falling behind and right now, I think the top needs a little bit of love with the all the leaves and stuff on there, so let's work on that. So I'm going to make a new layer underneath of the. The branch and. My idea will see if it's going to work is I have a brush that does. Some leaf textures and things, so I might begin with that. It's a pretty abstract look. So that will work here I think. And we can begin with this kind of. Texture and then paint on top will paint some individual leaves to kind of give it a more crisp look. This will be our starting point. So we want to add some different greens. It's a bunch of different greens in the reference. Blue greens A lot of it is pretty dark because there. The lights coming from behind and then the. Leaves are blocking it. So it's kind of a shadow depending on where the lights hitting this can produce really really bright leaves, but these are mostly mostly creating dark, so the way. And that makes a lot more sense. The lighting on the. The rock up here now that we have these leaves kind of makes sense that they're blocking some of the light and causing this patchy patchy lay situation. The leaves come down over here around. I'll try to be brave. Some of these need to be really, really dark and it feels like a bit extreme, but I think it will make more sense if we do some really dark ones. Feels more. Yeah, I just feels more lush, feels more like we're in this enclosed kind of place. Leaves pointing in towards the focal point. So I'm going to merge all the leaf layers until one this. And we can go to image, adjust Hue, saturation again like lighten them or add more saturation or shift the Hue. But I think I'm overall like happy with how it is. And then I will go on top of this layer and now we can make some of our own leaves too, 'cause these leaves in the image, they have a specific look. So what I'm doing is just taking the lasso tool and selecting. Based on the reference how the leaves look, the shape of them. I'm not sure the name of this type of tree. Maybe you guys recognize it, but I've definitely seen these before. And then we can fill it in. So then you get this kind of look. The downside to this is it's very. It can be sort of a digital look, depending on how the shapes that you make, because you get that very, very crisp lasso tool outline. One thing that you can do to help with that is lock the layer and use a textured brush of some kind to paint inside of there so we could choose something with like a canvas E texture or something like that, and then paint in that shape and that can be kind of cool, but I don't know. I don't think it's too bad. I don't think it's too obvious. I don't know. Let's just keep painting and see how it goes. There's other ways to paint it into the scene. So we'll get to that. And try them out. But I think I'm basically just going to add a bunch of little leaves like this. Oops, wrong brush. Uncheck the lot of transparency in paint a bunch in like that. It doesn't take too much, so my idea is one thing you can do to make it feel more painterly is then take another brush. An paint on top. So if you look at the reference some of these leaves actually quite a lot of them have bounce light, like a teal blue bounce light. So if we paint on top like this. We're adding that little bounce light that little highlight on the leaf, and so it kind of makes it look a little bit more hand painted. 'cause you're adding a little hand painted element to it. These over here I kind of like those two twigs like not having any leaves on them. I like that being kind of sparse up there. I'm not sure. Just put these guys somewhere. Yeah, I like that better. I like this just pointing out. OK, here it is. Fairly basic though, so don't get overrides OK, let's see. Oh you pick my favorite colors by the way. Thank you. Super cool yeah. The teal teal blue. Gradients I'm a fan. Maybe you notice that by some of my other like branding stuff I don't know, but nice color choice and thank you. How sweet of you. I'm going to add some were shadows over here. I'm just realizing this could be a little darker. So I'm kind of in the stage where now I feel a little bit more like everything is at least present right. The waterfall is there, the trees there. So now I can kind of move around the scene as I want and clean things up, add more details and just have fun painting around and. Polishing I guess we're in the polishing phase now. I think we can definitely use some layer blending modes to bump up the drama. In this one. We can definitely do that. Nice well. It's a great color, great color combo. Blue Antilock Wise. Always been my favorite color but I'm starting to starting also. Really love green as you may be compelled from these kind of paintings that I do. I really love green also, but blue was always my favorite from childhood to now. So at this phase I'm also trying to stay pretty zoomed out because I'm trying to see how everything's working together. We did zoom in a couple times, we zoomed in on the waterfall and we zoomed in on the trees and so was treating some of that stuff on top, but now we are back to zooming out and trying to take in the whole scene here and make sure it makes sense. Altogether. I'm a really big fan of dry brushing in traditional, so I try to. I like to get that kind of look. I'm trying to figure out how to do that in. My digital work too. Let's do a little bit of. Layer layer blending modes and stuff like that, and then we'll. Will keep painting. So. I'm going to make a new layer and I think basically what I'm looking for is color. Dodge will put a layer on color Dodge. I'm going to double click that layer an unchecked transparency shapes layer. I do this almost every time that I use color Dodge 'cause I prefer the look when that is unchecked, so we'll go to the airbrush. I almost always use the Airbrush when I do these kind of little effects. So I'm just going to choose a bright warm color. And just pop that in. And you can see how it's going to overexpose really, really quickly. So we gotta be careful, but just a little bit like this. And here at the waterfall. And put a little bit of light right on those splashes. And anywhere that you want it to feel like the light is really shining strongly. Maybe we can put up more green in the water. So before after, before after, it's really magic. Oh nice, Martin, that's awesome. Thanks, thanks for sharing that. That makes me happy. So I think what I'm going to do now is make a new layer and go to image apply image, so I'm at those phase where I kind of want everything to be merged and start doing finishing touches, but I don't really want to like get rid of everything else I've done below an like merge it all and lose it. So I'm just going to kind of group these and keep them just in case we will make it group so we look like we're organized and then we'll keep painting on top of this layer. So there's my. Little compromise. Color Dodge is really nice, but cannot get out of hand quickly. That is so true. Absolutely yeah, I feel that I have to stop myself from going overboard and sometimes they don't succeed. Sometimes I sometimes I go overboard. Do you wanna hi Mattie, do you use a hardcover film to protect your tablet? Thank you lot. You're amazing. Oh thank you. Thank you for the nice comments. I do not use any type of film on my tablet, but I think it depends on what kind of tablet you're using. If you want to use something like that. So for the Centriq, it's not really required like the tablet screen can hold up without getting scratches on it. With normal use like the Stylus is not going to scratch it. I haven't scratched it anyway yet. I haven't experienced it getting scratches, so it's pretty sturdy and doesn't have a problem with that, so I don't like to put anything on top of it because I prefer as little parallax as possible. So that means like this the as you put your stylus against the screen. There's that little bit of glass that makes it feel like you're not right on the paper, but there's that little space in between and that's gotten a lot better with the newer models and overtime it's just. Gotten better and better, but there is that little weirdness and I don't like to put any extra layers on there unless I absolutely have to. And so it doesn't really need the extra protection so I don't put it on, but some tablets might have a different a screen that's made out of something different, and maybe it would benefit you to have a protective layer on top. I'm not 100% sure. I've definitely heard people using things like that on their tablets, but. I don't think. For mine that I wouldn't bother with it. So if I turn this later on and off, you can see what I'm adding. I'm just going in with some different colors of green, some more vibrant ones, and just popping in little little pop so late in between in between here. Hungarian. I'm happy you're feeling inspired, but I'm sorry that you're having that experience. All I can tell you is I started doing these virtual Plein Air Studies about like it's at least a year and a half ago now an I made a lot of bad paintings like I promise you, especially at the beginning when I first started doing these because I used to paint primarily paint characters, and I've shown some of the early ones on my Twitch stream before. Just kind of reminiscing. And yeah, you just have to take my word for it. There was a lot of really rough. Change things at the beginning and even now like I have some days where things are just off and it's just not working for me. But overall it's it's yeah it's. It's gotten better, but. My point is, it takes a lot of practice with doing these and they do get it does get better. So if you feel like things aren't working just hang in there and anytime that you do want to go studies it's. It's adding to your visual library is adding to your experience, and as you go there's going to be less failures. An more fun at the beginning if you're trying something new, like if you are doing more landscape painting and you haven't or any little anything really, those it's really hard at first. I'm very lucky that I had my life stream community to hang out and encourage each other and people encourage me to keep going while I was feeling that way, you know? And I'm very thankful for that because. It's hard, it's hard to push through when you're having. Those days are just feeling like nothing is working. But I promise that anybody that's gotten good at painting landscapes or anything is definitely felt that way. It's like, Super Normal. This is so beautiful. Well then you love the idea of using Google images in Google Maps. Going to try this. Nice thanks Alice. Yeah, it's really really fun and you can if you do share your work, use the hashtag virtual plein air, and then people can. You can see if they're looking for that, take about it. Hi Andy logo. Hope you're doing well. I think I'm going to add a couple more little branches. I kept the branches really come to a minimum in my painting, but I don't know. I feel like we're missing something. So in the in the reference, there's a. Random little branches coming down like this. I think I'm going to try to add them. Sorry for the background noise by the way. My boyfriend's working from home now like a lot of us. So there's little background noise. Do you have Instagram? I do it should be the link should be in the description below the stream video. And if you can't find it, let me know. I'll post it in the chat. Maybe you could do movies, TV show stills as well. Yeah, I've thought about that so many times and. Rarely done it, but it's a really good idea. What I have done is a bunch of video game Screenshots, which probably isn't as beneficial, but is also fun and fun is important. I'm an architect and do a lot of architectural visualization sketches, but it's hard to switch my style. Oh, that's awesome. That's awesome. Must be cool to design things that actually get get built. But yeah, I can imagine that you're used to a pretty precise way of working. Yeah, thanks for asking Alex. Just adding little highlight to the branch here. Yeah, I think I like that. I think I like that he had a couple more. I'm going to get carried away. Yeah, that's nice. Let's try let's try a couple more. It's at least one more, and then we'll add some leaves and then we should be good. It's nice these branches bringing RI back into the scene. There's also branches coming in from the side over here, so we can take a look at that. Do it on its own layer, just in case. Just in case. We don't like it. So here's an example of something that I really like in paintings when it happens so. Having to do with the values, if we turn this into black-and-white, this is this. Green mossy area is lighter than the branch coming out, but the branch comes out into the light at a perfect time. Where the background here is in shadow. Technically, in the reference, this wasn't happening in such a dramatic fashion, but I tried to exaggerate it because I love when this happens and it makes it much easier for the viewer to see what's going on. Because you get that contrast, it's popping either way, so this is a popular thing. In portrait painting, you know to have, like. The background is dark over here and then the person's face is light and then as it shifts, its the opposite on the other side. So you can see what's going on even though we have that shift. So up over here, we want to bring these. Yeah, that's definitely going to help. There's all these mossy. Branches there really green. I don't think I got the right color yet, but this is the idea. They're going to come down from over here. Yeah, that would be nice. What kind of do our own thing? They don't have to be exactly like the reference, but it's working, so maybe just the stick pretty close to what is there. The colors are so good. Thank you. These colors make me happy. It's like my favorite. The Bright, Bright Green's a little bit of warm light. I love I love these kind of. Scenarios. Alright, I think it's a little weird how these are all stopping right here, so we're going to do the same thing. We're going to have them come out in front here and. Be a little bit darker. So we can see them. Something like that. And maybe another one. Is also going to reach out? Or maybe this one will have another little branch come off of it. Something like that. Maybe it's too small. I can barely see it. We need leaves. I think. Let's add some leaves on this one. Liquor selection Cute little leaves. It looks kind of funny. All thanks, thank you James. I'm glad you think so. And look at the upper area with the rocks cleans. It reads better than the reference. Thank you. I've been trying to get better at like simplifying the references a little bit, especially ones like this. They're kind of overwhelming with a lot of detail, so I'm glad you like that choice. It's. Something I've been working on and it's like a little hit or miss when I make the right choices with that stuff. I want to get some more of these leaves with a little bit of bounce light shine that blue that adds a lot of depth to foliage I think. Alright, now I'm going to zoom in on the branches over here on the left a little bit because I think they're a little flat. what I have going on here? I'm going to lock the layer, let's color pic from it and choose a little bit of a darker color and give like a tiny bit of a shadow to the branches on the underside. Feel like their little flat with just the one color and their little close to the viewer to have such little detail. So even just a little bit something. And we'll add some more leaves over here. I'm just looking at the reference and there's some little little leaves up and out, and having that shine on there, it's just. Good addition, we got going on. Could you grab the airbrush or any softer brush? Something like this up like this up a little bit. Maybe we'll put that layer underneath the branch. I do want some leaves there, but I don't know if I like that. A lot of trial and error. OK. So. Let's Merge this stuff. And I think we're kind of at the point where we're going to put some finishing finishing touches here. What I tend to do sometimes is after after stream I'll kind of put down a painting for a little bit and then, like a day later, so I'll take another look at it and see if I get any ideas. It's a really nice luxury if you have an artwork you're working on where you don't have to immediately post it or publish it or send it in. Sometimes you have deadlines and that's how it is. You have a deadline, but if you don't it's nice to have a couple like a day or. In a couple of days to think about your leave your art alone and then look at it again. And a lot of times you'll come up with some different ideas of things to change or ad. I feel like I've significantly improved paintings in the past by waiting a little bit longer before posting them, and then suddenly like a big mistake is visible to me. Or, you know, just something that could be improved a lot, and when you're looking at something for a long time, sometimes you become blind to those little things, so some other reason it's good to ask for. Second opinion if you have artist, friends and things like that. If any of you guys are looking for. That kind of. Feedback on your work. You're welcome to join my discord. There's like a share your art section, and there's a place to share your art. And there's a place to ask for critique. So if you want to share your art without. Asking for critique that still fine, but there's critique section if you want. And anyway, yeah, that can also help get a another look at it for exercise, but for me a lot of times I just like to give myself a little break between posting. And yeah, I don't know if you guys have ever had this, but for some reason it seems like the second you post something that's when you notice the thing that's wrong with it. Like instantly after being posted like oh, why did I post it so quick, so yeah. Long story short, I will probably after the stream I will probably take a break from this painting. Maybe come back to it. Tomorrow or so and then see if it's really done, and then that'll be it. Share it. I'll probably post this one here on be hands 'cause I like how it's coming out. Thank you, great depth in your pic. Thank you Robert. I really love these kind of lighting scenarios because there's a lot of opportunity to show depth. I think it's. More so than. Some areas that don't have as dramatic lighting, so I'd look painting dramatic lighting. This. I'm gonna go one more time over it with the splash brush. By the way, if anybody was painting along and you want to share. I will probably be finishing up kind of soon, so if you'd like me to be able to look at and show your artwork on the screen. Think about maybe uploading it soon, no rush if you're not ready, you can always still just post it later in my discord. If you'd like to share it there or during the feature stream. The way to rush through your work, but I just wanted to give a heads up. Alright, so we got some little splashes. OK like that, duplicate the layer if we want to make it a little bit more intense, but I don't think so. I think it's fine. Work a little bit more in the waterfall. We're done. I think I should pay more waterfalls like I love these types of scenes, but I found the waterfall, the actual waterfall. You know, the water really difficult to paint, so that means we should probably paint more of these. I don't think I would mind too much, but I need to practice. I paint a lot of waterfalls, scenes or I have painted a lot of waterfall scenes from further away, and that's very different because the the water just kind of becomes one big stream. That's like a lot easier to Stylize. But this one was like. Much more difficult bobbies. Things happening. Thank you auntie pixel. Thanks very much. Painting along rushing again. Oh, clever, don't don't rush too much. You're always welcome to share it later. I don't want to ruin your painting experience here. My take might finish it another day. Alright, so we've got so far from Jackson Joker. I love how your water came out. What do you think about it? I hope you like it. Captures a feeling of motion. It really feels like it's moving and flowing down and this area down here. I'm gonna think I'm gonna take some hints from what you did. Look at this look at this area. This shift from. Teal green gold warm olivey green. That's really pretty. I think this is working too. Yeah, that's awesome, beautiful. Beautiful. Oh my gosh, I love it. Thank you for painting with me. Thank you. Thanks everyone who's painting along. I'll share my study in the discord later. Still not really far with it. Oh, I totally get it. No worries. Like I said, I probably will. I might spend a little bit more time on this too on another day before I finally call it done, but I think I think it's not a good place for now for me. Larious isn't really new with digital painting. It's also encouraging hearing your story. I wish I could remember to know each time you drop a helpful trick all like the lasso thing. Well, thank you if you find it helpful to watch again later. I don't know if it's too long for something like that, but my video any of my past stream videos are available on my page. If you go to my profile here on the hands and click the videos tab there all there and there's actually something really nice that be hands has the. It's called a tool timeline and it's not visible when I'm live, but if you watch any of my past videos, it's recording as I stream. It's recording the tools that I'm using an like the brushes and colors that I'm picking and everything, and it will show that during the playback. So if you if I'm going too fast for anything then you will be able to see it in the tool timeline. It's super cool, you check it out and all the streams are recorded there. Bottom half I'm happy with top half not so much. Yeah, it's I. I feel like that in a sense like for me I feel like this area is. It's like. I don't know. I feel like it's maybe not quite done, but I'm not sure why. I don't know yet. I'm going to like sit on it a little bit will be a little bit, but I'll show you guys what we did today for anybody who came in during the latter part of stream. This was the first painting of the day. Different mood, but still beautiful lighting, right? That's like what inspires me. That's what makes me want to paint something is when I see lighting. Whether it's beautiful daytime scene with dappled lighting, or like sunset or sunrise, these type of lighting situations. Are my favorite thing, so this was the first painting and this is the second one. They're both photo studies. You can find the reference images below. The stream in the description and they were both started from. From Blank canvas. So if anybody wants to watch those later, they'll be available. Thank you, pablo's. There is a lot of new people here today. I really appreciate you guys popping in and keeping US company. Thank you. Burn it. The things everybody I will be here again on be hands next Wednesday and will be doing more of this. You guys are always welcome to paint along with me. If you like. I will share my references. I know sometimes it's hard to finish at the same time, but you're always welcome to share your work. Whether you finish early or if you need a little more time, you can always post in my discord or tag me on social media. When you post your work. Thanks Ryan. Thanks everybody, well, I guess that's it for today. If you guys want to keep in touch in between streams, you can join my discord community. Link is in the description below and the that's that's it. Thank you for AC. Thanks everyone. I hope you all safe. Stay safe, take care of yourselves and hope you have a good rest of your day. An I will see you next time. Thanks Jackson, thanks everybody, will see you later.

print anyway. But yeah, it's a good size. I think so. Um. Well, I'm glad you came over Reaper. Are you staying close to the ref or stylizing a bit more well. I think I always stylize some amount whether I want to or not just because I'm not painting. I'm never painting in like a hyper realistic manner. So there's always going to be a little bit of stylization to it. I generally lean a bit more towards like semi realism like kind of idealizing some of the features and the smoothing things out of it, I guess. But. Lately, I've been really favoring a more traditional painting style to the artworks through the paintings. If that makes sense. So I like to use textured brushes. I like to use things that resemble oil painting or gouache painting or watercolor. I like I like going for a traditional kind of look in my digital painting, but I'm very much doing like style explorations lately so. We'll see how it goes you might see some I might I'm going to be using my painterly brush set so if you guys want to download that it is, you can find it. Again, on the screen in the stream description or in the info panel. This is a free brush set and I've made some of the brushes and some were collected overtime. You can download it. Like I said it's free to download and there's a lot of. Textures like this, let me show real quick. Some of the brushes that I like have this kind of texture to them. So it's a little bit to imitate traditional type of painting look and also for anybody who has the Adobe If you have the subscription to photo shop. If you have Adobe. CC then you can download the Kyle Webster brushes as well. And those have a lot of good traditional textures, and a lot of awesome awesome effects. Traditional type affect so those are good to look at 2. But. Yeah, that's my plan that's my plan today will see what we end up with. But Yes, it will most certainly certainly be a little bit stylized so I'm going to start out with a Gray background just because I think it's a little bit more relaxing to look at and easier to start with so we'll start with a Gray background and I'm going to use my pencil brush and Oh actually yes and I also have the reference image over here, we bring it on screen. From my other monitor do why is it stuck. There we go just so you can see what I'm looking at you can download image if you'd like to see a closer. Pilot tiesha welcome how's your day going? I hope you guys are doing good. I'm going to paint the whole image for this one like it's I'm considering this a portrait. But it's also you know, kind of upper body. We're going to get the whole. We're going to get the whole thing in because I need to practice painting fabric folds, and wrinkles and things. I really like this sweater. It's so cozy looking and soft. So we'll try to like really make it look like that. So when I'm painting someone even with like a big fluffy sweater like this, I like to consider there. Their skeletal structure underneath the clothes so I'll kind of do like a little stick person. Because that helps me figure out where to place things if you kind of start painting the outside without thinking about what's going on underneath of it, you're going to end up with a big blob. It's nice to at least think a little bit about where things are going underneath of the underneath of the clothes. Um red it's just allergies. Thank you for being concerned, but I've been getting this question a lot. Lately, an sadly. This is just kind of what I'm going to sound like for the next maybe 2 months. Hopefully not that long, but I have seasonal allergies. I always get really bad allergies in the spring, usually even if I'm taking Medison I end up being stuffy and. Itchy eyes and weird voice and all kinds of stuff. So yeah, don't worry. I'm not sick. I'm just yeah. This is how I am at this time of year spring seems to be starting early here in the Netherlands. We didn't get a proper winter and yeah, there's all kinds of Flowers blooming and it looks nice. But then it makes me like this so. I'm sorry I have some tea, I will be drinking, so that helps a little bit. OK, so. Yeah got a little bit of a sketch like a stick person sketch and then I'll lower the Opacity on that and make a new layer and just start painting on Top or sorry sketching on Top next layer of. Next layer of. Detail. Oh, that's OK read no, I know I don't mind that's OK. I just feel bad 'cause. I've been getting that question a lot feel like I'm concerning you guys over over nothing but this is just like how I am right now. Reaper says my problem with that is every time I try it. They always end up looking through the but I think it's a practice thing I just need to get better at so I like using the stick person to just imagine that it's like this skeleton underneath and then I lower the Opacity and make a new layer and start properly sketching in in a more you know, keeping an eye moron like a 3D kind of. Viewpoint of it. So right now, I'm sketching in the wrinkles. And going around here. And so you can still see where the stick person is inside the sketch, but at least that gives me like an idea of where to put everything and then I don't end up really, really far off you can still be a little bit off. But it helps it helps give some kind of a starting point, I feel like. It can be overwhelming when you're starting to work on something. Do you still have the same food allergies actually it's been a little bit different since moving to the Netherlands Interesting? I guess the produce is a little bit different here. I have, I do have some still have some food allergies, but? It depends it's a little bit less like I can eat some things I couldn't eat before. At least certain brands of things I don't know if that makes sense. But like I'm allergic to some apples, but not all apples. Not all brands of apples. It might have something to do with chemicals being used rather than the actual Apple itself. But yeah, I do? Yeah. But back to the painting. So. Let's bring this arm down here. I will give a little wrinkle over on the side. And we can flip the canvas to get a look at it from over here. I want to get the feeling of her like kind of leaning over a little bit so I think it's working OK, so far. Let me change my. Eraser. I like the post of her hand. I think it's pretty. I like wearing sweaters that have a little bit longer sleeves because it's extra cozy and warm and. Yeah, I can keep your hands warm. I often have cold hands. So I like sweaters like this, I like cats coming up a little higher on her hand. OK Letisha well, thanks for hanging out. Enjoy the lurk. So let's get the head sheep. Hi Mister, Photoshop are how are you? I'm going to add a little bit more tilt to her head. I think I under estimated it. So yeah, will tilt it a little bit more. And that way we can have her hair kind of gravity is sort of affecting. Her hair and it's coming down around an over the shoulder like this. OK so I want to sketch in her facial features. And probably I probably will do this on another layer so I feel OK with how this looks so far, so I'm going to make a new layer that way. I have more flexibility to move things around. I think I made her face a little bit, too big but let's see how it goes. Reaper. Your being torn in different directions. OK, so. Let's make some lines here to try to help guide us on where facial features will go so this will be roughly like the eyes and eyebrows and then the nose and mouth is close to her, her hand is very next to her mouth so that will be down there and then her chin gets covered up by the hand. And her finger should be a little bit more up here in the cheek. So we'll move that and then her other finger. Down there. Sketch in the eyebrows. I like to make these guidelines and then lower the Opacity. And draw on Top of it, so that I can use them to help me figure out where to put things but they don't block my vision, so much. I'm a real. Who are you little question? Are you working with the graphic tablet if yes? Which one I'm doing good thanks and I am using a tablet. I have a welcome centriq 22 and that is a. Screen tablet, but I'm using a stylus to draw on the screen. There's a lot of options out there, though this you don't have to dive in and get something like a centigrade off the back 'cause they're. The generally a little bit more on the high end tablet wise, but I do really love my tablet, but there's a lot of options, you can look into. There's tablets that. You know there's screen tablets and then there's tablets that have it's kind of like your drawing on the mouse pad looking up at your monitor those are generally. Less expensive models, but can still be really good. Yeah, Oh, I forgot to mention that Mills. Yeah, it's really, really great news. Behance just made some some. Upgrades basically behind the scenes. So there will be less delay in the conversation between the chat and and you know what I mean, there's a little less stream delay, so it's going to be easier for us to chat. It's yeah, it's a big improvement high share a little question are you working with the graphics tablet. Oh yeah, yeah, so I'm using a Wakeham Centriq 22. I can post the name in the chat. In case it's easier to read that then my pronunciation, but yeah. I'm drawing on the screen. I think it's really helpful for painting it's not required to have a tablet for all types of. Digital art of course, but if you are painting or drawing and you want to have pressure sensitivity like for example, if you want. If you want your brush to get bigger and darker as you press down that's something that you can't really do with the mouse. You need a tablet some kind. Red cells would you say chatting me or chat and I OK this is one of those things to get off topic from art and go into a grammar. Discussion that's one of those things when I was in school. Apparently saying like chat and I or you know, my friend Susie and I would be technically correct grammar from what I was taught but nobody speaks like that at least not. Where I'm from in America? Most people will say and me, just colloquially more normal to say so. You can certainly say, and I if you want, but Nobody really speaks like that commonly so it's kind of strange but. Hey Drado welcome thanks for joining us. OK so let's sketch in her mouth. Depends on where in the sentence, it is. Yeah, that's also true that's also true. I have definitely don't know the rules enough to start teaching grammar two guys. I just know that normally it's one of those things that it's not a big problem. If you say, and me 'cause you'll just sound like most other people? Hey al, How are you? So I feel like it would be a benefit me to just take a little bit of extra time to sketch in the face and things and we can always fix it a little bit more in the painting phase. It's going OK, Reaper I'm I'm taking classes and that's going well, learning a language is a long journey just like. Yeah, learning an instrument or learning painting, it's something that you have to work on over a longer period of time I don't necessarily feel or see like a drastic improvement from one day to the next but I know I'm doing the right thing. Just studying and keeping going with it. So yeah, it's going OK. Thank you Sammy how are you? Thanks for the next comment. Hi Hun, Ji how are you? So the models like looking at us. So I can put her. Iris and the Right corner of her eye. She is a really pretty. I shape I think in her eyebrows like it. I think I've given her much bigger forehead, then she actually has Bo. Luckily, that's easy to fix one thing I love about digital art is you can just in this case. I'm using the lasso tool. You just make a selection of an area, I can transform it down. I can work it, I can there's just so many ways. You can take your pick. But there's a lot of different ways to easily modify that so I use the transform tool is quite a bit in my sketch phase to fix little things here and there. Hi Phil's how are you? OK, so let's merge these 2 layers together had them separate for awhile. But I think we're good to merge and see what we can do from here. So she has a little bit of a swirl going on in that her hair and the hair part. And then got cheekbone and her finger kind of. Pushing into her cheek a little bit so we get a little bit of an indentation there. And then this finger. And then this one. And then finally little one. We do see her knuckles coming out. And then the sweater. Alright so let me just take a look at the fabric folds because I do want them to be accurate. Since this is one of the main reasons that I'm studying this image is because I want to get some practice painting folds fabric folds. It's something that I generally kind of avoid be honest. And my way of avoiding it is just I'll generally really tone down any folds that exist in fabric when I'm painting someone I find that they can make an image look really messy and they make it hard for you to see the anatomy of the person. I tend to like to paint more fitted clothing. But even when there are wrinkles and things I generally kind of tone him down. A little bit so there's still wrinkles. But maybe not quite as much as you see here so. That said, We're trying to get a little bit of practice on this subject. So I'm going to try to properly illustrate them, take my time to do a better job. Right now, I'm just putting some lines in to show myself where the wrinkles are going to be and then when we start painting. I'll be able to do the shading and. Paint with this sketch to help me. I heard in a video once that the less folds, the better it reads. Yeah, I think I think it's true like I think that you can give the idea of the folds without necessarily having an absolute ton of them. If you I feel like if you especially if you focus the folds in like you know for example, the underarm area, or this you know your elbow anywhere, where you're moving and creating this crease, putting a couple fold. There is great, but I really do think it makes for a cleaner image to not over do it. With the clothing folds. So I'm hoping that these studies will make me get you know. Give me a little bit more practice in painting them properly when I do include them. But I don't think that I will in the future be. Still, trying. I don't think I will have a big change with how I how many folds. I generally paint in a scene that makes sense like hopefully, I'll be able to do a better job with them because of this practice, but I still think I kind of prefer not to over do it. Because exactly what Red said it becomes hard to see the form of the person underneath all the wrinkles. There's also a little bit of extra challenge in that bees. The folds and her whole sweater has stripes alittle bit. There's some kind of striping pattern in the texture of the shirt. It's not printed strikes. But like a textured stripe so we'll see if that's going to make it into the painting. I think I'd like to indicate that kind of texture. It looks nice and soft. But also seems like a lot of extra work. So we'll see if we can give a hint of that type of fabric texture without painting every single line. Hopefully we can, we can do that. Just cleaning up my sketch of her finger a little bit. I made it worse. Alright we'll leave that for now. And clean out more in the painting phase. I'm just cleaning up erasing out some of my lines. They aren't Needed. Read says putting less folds to illustrate how the club is wrapping or moving. I think you can start with adding a bunch and try to erase some to the point. Its most readable for you. That's a good way of doing it. See, which ones you can get away without having. Oh, I'm sorry read I don't know the exact. The number restriction character limit on the chat. Actually, not sure what it is. I'm going to move her hands up a tiny bit more. It's a little bit higher than I had it. I think a little bit closer to her face. Yeah. 200. OK. Hello fire how are you? I'm using work to just modify my sketch of her face. The tiny bit like think I think we're ready to start painting. And I don't think that everything is perfect, with this sketch. But I don't consider my sketches to be like a finished line art or something it really is more of a sketch. What I'll do is put it on multiply so it's easier to see through lower the opacity to like 1820% something you know something around there and then lock. The layer press this button right here and that way. If you try to paint on it, it won't allow you so I do this because I'm going to be painting under this layer and just using it as a guide of like where to paint an I don't want to accidentally pay on the sketch layer. Well, I can pass that on that feedback on red so thanks for letting me know. OK. So we'll save here and we're going on, too. And you A new chapter of this painting so. New layer and I have to decide what order I want to paint things in when I'm painting landscapes. I really like to go back to front. It's just a logical way to do it to paint the Sky first or whatever is furthest away. In this scene, we could do something similar and paint the background first or at least get a base. Kind of color back in there, the only problem I run into when I have a really dark background, which this is a pretty dark. One is once you start painting in a color back there. I'll just do it quick example. Once I start painting in this background. Color then suddenly, we can't see the sketch anymore. And it gets really hard to work. So I think what I'll do is paint in her at least as like a very base base color like will just use a block block. Something in for her. That way we can paint. The background and we can still see our sketch and it will be a little easier, that way so. OK, so I think I will use a soft brush. There's multiple ways to do this. Sometimes if I want to go quickly and fill in a big selection. I'll just take the lasso tool like this select it and just pop pop a paint bucket in like that. That's a really quick way the only downside to this is. You end up with some really sometimes really hard edges to your selection. You can use the feathering on the lasso to help prevent that. But I'm just going to use a soft paint brush to fill in to paint in inside my sketch and the reason for this is I'm hoping to get a nice. Painterly sortof affect to the this artwork. I'd like it to look more hand painted so, so actually painting it in with the brush instead of making a selection it gives a little bit less of A. Technical look to it, it makes it look more handgun so. OK, so now we have a base color an now because of that we can paint behind it, and do things with the background and. It's not a problem we don't sketch doesn't completely disappear, so that's why I'm going in this order. Although I'd really rather do the background first, but now we can do it. So. In the background, we have, like a really dark. Really dark areas. In between these leaves and then the leaves kind of like coming out into the light a little bit. So you get a lot of these deep shadows. So I think a good way to paint this, or what might be a little bit of an easier way is to go sort of dark to light so pick a pretty dark color put that in as the base and then on Top of it start painting leaves coming out of the shadows rather than adding the shadows too. To a lighter painting, I think it will be easier to go dark to light. So that's something to think about. Hail avenged thanks for coming over. How are you? Hi Alexander, I'm doing well thanks. I am excited about this painting actually it's I don't know it has kind of like even though she's wearing modern clothing. She's wearing like this fluffy sweater. I kind of getting like forest. Elf vibes from this reference a little bit with the leaves all over her like it's just very kind of autumn. It's a good feeling so I like this reference. So I'm going to start with this dark background, something very dark Brown green something in the middle there. And yeah, you can just use a paint bucket or fill it in however you want. But there's our background. I'm going to make a new layer on Top of that. And we can start painting some colors coming out from the background, so for example, you can really take any brush. It depends on what style you want to go for and just start painting. Little little shapes like this, it will start looking like little leaf shapes coming out of the shadows so for me. I think it would be nice to choose brushes that are a little bit. Um textured or have a little bit of a look like it's a real paint brush or something like that. I also recently created a whole pack of brushes that has like foliage shapes and all kinds of stuff like that. Some of those might be handy for a quick for a really quick impression of leaves back there. That would be nice and fast, another thing. Is we can choose to put a blur effect on this background so that's something we can do if you look at the image over here on the right is a little bit of a Leica distance. Blair can you see that, like the Camera lens blur and then over here closer to her. It's nice and in focus, so we can also do that in our painting. Sometimes it's nice to to paint in real quick and then you know you can. Just go to filter blur and use like a gausian blur or lens blur or something like that. There's actually a lot of box blur. There's a lot of options that will work. And you can put this blur filter on so look how quick and easy that is. I honestly I think that fastest and easiest way for me to paint this would be to. Yeah, do 1 layer really quick just scribbling in basically and then go ahead and blur it and then paint on Top. So that's going to be my plan. How do you change pen tryst pencil so quick Hey Quinn so I just if you click up here? To your when you have your brush tool selected you can click up here and it brings the drop down menu for your brushes and you can scroll through them and select them you can even set up keyboard shortcuts to automatically switch you to the next brush or to a previous brush or something like that. But I honestly. I usually just scroll through them and pick them out this way. Thanks, Mohammed. Thank you that would be awesome avenged. I'd love if you would join us on this one. Yeah, so let me will just go through and pop in some more leaves like this and then will apply a blur and then will paint another layer on Top so I think that will be. Pretty fast way to do this. And if you want you can use a couple different I'm using uh. Like a plant brush. Sometimes it's nice to use a couple different types of shapes to make it look more natural but realistically with the amount of blur. I'm going to put on this, it probably doesn't matter if we really use a lot of different shapes or not. You could probably just also go in with like any shape brush and it would be fine. Another thing you can do is go to edit transform perspective. And maybe keep in mind that it looks like the. The Flowers or plants to the right are getting smaller and the ones getting closer to us on the left. There are bigger just because of the angle how she is against the wall that's something to think about but. I think. I will just pay attention to that when I get into the next painting fees. OK let's see what this looks like. Filter blur Gaussian blur Gaussian blur ends up being my favorite most of the time it's just like. A real basic blur. Alright I think that's good. So now I've got blurred background and this is just a base for us to paint on Top of this is just making our job a little bit easier. 'cause Can you imagine look at this? How much detail there is coming into this scene having to paint all that it seems a bit overwhelming so having this as a starting point is for me a little bit. More welcoming that we could make a new layer and start painting a little bit nice nicer on Top of it. So. For example, let's find. A brush we want to use I like. This one poops let me show you hear this one, it looks like a paintbrush. If you like this brush or any of the brushes. I'm using there are links below in the stream description. And you can go a little bit both ways. You can choose the dark color from The Shadow and start painting. Some of that in there's going to be a little bit of a disconnect at first just a warning when you're painting on Top of this blurred background and you start using a hard edge brush or something like that. It's going to be a bit jarring at first to see those hard edges. It's going to look like it doesn't belong you have to do some more painting to kind of blend the. The out of focus with the more focused if you want a slightly more subtle transition between the two you could use a brush like this one, which has is a little bit softer, it does have hard edge, but it's a little bit softer, so that might. That might feel better, so we can start painting with this one. So I just want to get the background a little bit more far along it's not I don't want to sit here and paint the whole background before starting the character but or the? The woman in the portrait, but I do want to get a little bit more done just because I personally find that. Having the backgrounds at least blocked in well enough, it helps give the idea of the mood and the environment that the person is in because a lot of times lighting and things in the background will affect your character in this scene. Maybe it's not in a really dramatic way, but often you'll see that. Light will bounce off of something let's say if you character standing next to a blue ball or something light will hit that wall and then hit the person and you'll see like a little bit of blue on their skin. For example, or it'll just tint them a little bit. So the environment around whoever your painting if you're doing a portrait for example, is pretty important to consider early on. Even though you it might be way more excited about painting the person and the environment if you do consider it. It will it will pay off will pay off? So just a few more leaves. Then we'll start painting Our Lady and then we'll take a break from the background for a bit and come back to this later. I try to work around the scene kind of. Alright evenly so I don't want to take any one area and make it completely finished. Before the other areas got a chance to have anything done to them. I like to move around to work around the image and slowly. Get everything towards a finished place so that's why we should probably stop here on the background before I get too carried away. Thank you for choosing to work on this ref the sweater seems intimidating Oh you're welcome. Thank you. I'm glad you like this one. I hope it's gonna go well. I think I think it will. This is also a learning experience for me, I'm happy to teach what I do know and share my process, but As we do these paintings of different different subjects. I'm also learning a lot as we go so there might be a little trial and error along the way here. But OK let's get back to Our Lady now. So just looking at her looking at my reference seeing if there's anything since I've been looking at the background for awhile not looking at her sometimes looking back, you will start just notice something different that you didn't notice before so I think I'm just going to add a little bit more width to the sweater on her on the left side. OK and then. Let's start painting. Your color panel looks so cool well. Thank you Bella. It is an extension. It's Coulouris. I'm going to type in the chat for you. If you want to look it up because it's a little bit of A. Weird spelling so. Yeah, that's That's it if you wanted to look it up. I do really like it, although if you have the recent if you have 2019 or 2020 photo shop. You can go to window color and you can get a color wheel with the triangle now in the past. It was the Hue cube like this, which is still available but you can also go here and switch to color wheel. So this is very similar to Coulouris Coolers, a couple extra functions that I don't use often but I have it. So it will use it. But if you really only care about the triangle you can get it through photo shop. OK, so. I'm going to let's get into painting her so I'm going to lock the layer. This is a super convenient thing because we have this on its own layer. You can press this little checkerboard icon appear and then when I paint on that layer anything that I do anything that I paint is only going to be allowed to affect that shape that I already created so I don't even have to worry. I can just paint. However, I want then it's going to be in the lines so that's really nice. Because then we can do things like for example, pick a shadow color and kind of just come along the edge and swipe in like this and. It's just only only within that shape. So. See what I was talking about earlier with the colors surrounding the character may be affecting them. I'm noticing now that there's a little bit of a green hint to the color of the shadow on her sweater over here and I think that's a little bit of a reflection of the wall, the plant will next door so. I tend to work. Midtones 1st and then shadows and highlights. So what that means is usually in the early in the early phases of my painting things don't have extremely high contrast usually. It's going to be a little bit dark and then it gets brighter towards when it's getting more finished. So. Hi Mads, how are you? And we can choose a warmer color for to start differentiating the skin. From the rest of her and the same for her hair. Choose a Brown. So now we're having a little bit of trouble seeing her head separate from the background. So that's something we can look at later and maybe put some lighter leaves behind her head. So it makes it easier to see or highlights in her hair. We can decide how to do it. But basically one we should probably decide about one thing being slightly later than the other. So we'll be able to see her. Her head more easily. So her hair gets a little bit later towards the edges. A little bit more like Golden warm Brown color. Now there's a lot of different workflows in different ways to go about this. Right now, I'm basically trying to get somewhat of the local color painted in on each area like her hair. Is now a dark Brown her sweater? Is a beige trying to get the right color here? I want to go a little later? And I don't want to get sucked into any little little details on the sweater. Yet like any little wrinkles. I want to look at the big picture so big picture wise her arm is getting late. Splash here and here coming down the middle of course, the light is hitting certain ring. You know certain wrinkles and folds and you're seeing some in shadow, but we're not going to go super into that yet. We just want to establish where the big areas of light are so here. Play is hitting and here. And this arm is a pretty big. Area of way over here. So even my lights are not the brightest they're going to go right now. I want to save that for like. Finishing touches kind of thing at the end, we're going to put in the brightest highlights or maybe not. The very end, but it's something we're working our way up to. There's a hand, I know there's a hand. An extra little challenge. OK, so I'm going to make a new layer. We were painting. All of that basically right on the layer and I'm going to make a new layer now and we're going to make a clipping mask so this is the layer. I'm going to right click, and go to create clipping mask or you can use a shortcut for that. You can hold alt and hover your stylus. In between the new layer and the one you want to clip on to an just press down when you see the arrow icon. Then you have a clipped layer so this is the same thing almost as the lock transparency in the sense that I'm painting, I can only paint in the lines, but I'm painting on a separate layer from my painting, I can move this around they can get rid of it. So it's a little bit of less of a destructive painting method and the nice thing about this is I can paint on this layer and see if I like it if I can see if I like the results before like committing to what I've done so I'm going to switch to the Airbrush. And do a little bit of shading with the airbrush I'm going to put my layer blending mode on multiply because this is really handy for doing shadows multiply blending mode is nice because it it will darken areas. But it also it seems like you've got it tested out and get a feel for it, but It's nice because it preserves more of your detail it darkens everything in it doesn't just like with with a normal mode. If I use this color. It kind of wipes out all detail underneath whereas multiply will darken it. But you'll still be able to see what was already painted so it's a nice way to. Add shadows and modify your painting without having to redo everything. Underneath. Hawaii Gore how are you? I want to pick like a warm dark Brown and I'm going to use that to paint in some shadows and I'm going to take the lasso tool and use it as sort of a stencil so I'm going to use my lasso tool to block off areas that I want to either paint within or I want to avoid painting on so it kind of depends so for example, like this wrinkle over here. I'm going to make a selection of the area that I want to have a shadow and then. Paint in that area. And deselect and now you see that there's a shadow if you want to smudge. You can use the smudge brush if you want to soften that edge a little bit. Height one how are you? In this little there's a little. The wrinkle over here, so I'm going to do the same thing basically and create a little. Block off a little area where I want the darkest shadow to be. And then I just painted in that space. And the nice thing about this is you can create gradients. And like soft shading. And block off areas that you don't want to paint it and so I think it's very nifty. I use it a lot. I use this technique a lot. I think it went a little too, too, dark without wrinkles. So we can just use the airbrush to race out. Also, since we're talking we're doing studies on wrinkles and painting fabric in clothes and things I can say that. A lot of people underestimate how much you can do with just a little bit of Airbrush. Now I really like having textured look to my painting, but I still find that it sometimes it's easy to easier to use the airbrush to create a form. It's almost almost as an effect of like a 3D model sculpt if you do a nice job with the airbrush shading and then you can paint whatever kinds of textures, you'd like on Top. So I'm using the The Airbrush to get me started with putting the. Wrinkles where I want. Yeah, the delay is improved now, so it should be less than before. Um. Yeah, it specifically for. For me for streamers in Europe, it's a big improvement. His surplus how are you? Under her arm, we're going to add. A shadow. And that might be an area where we want to leave kind of hard edge or just a blurry a tiny tiny bit. It's reduced there still is a little bit of a delayed rado, but it's more within like. I think it's pretty normal amount at this point. There's almost always going to be at least a little bit of a delay with streaming. But it's a more minimal it seems. So tired today have a lot of things to do how are you today I'm doing good? I'm doing better than yesterday yesterday? I was feeling how you were feeling now, I was super tired. I didn't get a very good night of sleep, but last night was much better, so I feel alive feel alive today. So thank you doing, good, I hope I hope your day goes well, Despite that surplus. OK so we've got some wrinkles. And there are a bit dark, but we're going to go back in and do. More detail I can tone it down a little bit. Let's work on the face a little bit and we can use the same kind of techniques here. For example, behind the nose on this side of the face. We want we can put a shadow you can actually do the same thing and make a selection to block off the side of the nose. Like that. I like to use this much brush a lot, too kind of tone down my. My selections so they don't really want a hard edge to be seen there. I want a little bit more of a subtle. Little bit more so look. You can hear the birds in the background. I know it's like such a classic spring day feeling going on right here. It's nice weather outside and. Birds chirping. OK, So what I was talking about earlier. I usually work dark to light this painting is looking pretty muddy and pretty dark right now, but hang with me OK. We're going to get some life into it. I'll show you how I'm going to do that. Last thing I want to do shadow wise before we move on is just a painting her eyebrows. And then will start breaking things up here. Oh also beeping. OK so knew layer and I'll either do this next phase on normal layer mode or sometimes something like overlay. Overlay is really nice layer blending mode for sort of brightening things and giving a little extra saturation to them. I really like it for adding like subsurface, scattering to this skin that little effect of like for example, if you have a light shining from behind someone an going through their ear or something like that, and it gets like a pink color that's the subsurface scattering so. This can be really nice for that kind of effect. Right right we're in We're we're a bit in the ugly phase right now. It's like when the painting just doesn't look like what you intended to look like. But you gotta go through the phases, yeah, so we're going to brighten up her face a little bit. And this will also saturate a little bit give a little bit more color to her skin. I do use the layer blending modes of my painting. Some people prefer to paint all on normal mode. I've been doing that, more and more lately just because I think I've as I get more practice. I've been more likely to just pick colors. I like from the beginning with my painting it's not always the case. But. That being said, I do use layer blending modes a lot to like modify things that I've done and improve them so. Just give a little bit more. More life to this. And then now I'll make a new layer an paints with I'll go back to painting with normal. On a normal layer so I'm picking my own my own colors and everything like that. Versus like letting overlay. Give me surprise what's going to happen. So I'm going to choose pink for the lips? Actually, one thing that you can do is color pic from the colour. That's already there, and then modify that Hue shifted to something closer to what you want. Sometimes that'll help get a result, that's not so jarring. Then going to the color wheel picking a random color. All thank you pixel you're so sweet. Thank you. I really like her makeup too. I don't usually I usually like painting portraits where if I'm painting a female portrait. For example, like this one. I usually like going really natural and not putting a lot of makeup on it. On the face, but I think her makeup looks really nice and is kind of this natural earthy tones. So. People go with it. So a lot of times at this Phase I will try to get rid of my sketch. This is with, and without the sketch so you can see that I still kind of need it for some information. So here's my compromise. I'm going to duplicate the sketch. So I can save a layer just in case I need to reference. It later but what I'll do is. On the duplicate I'm going to erase out. Anything that I don't think I need any more. I think most of her outfit. The wrinkles are there enough that I don't really need the sketch anymore? The area that I really need it, I think is still her face. Maybe the eyes for example, 'cause I didn't really paint them in at all yet. So I'm just erasing everything that's not needed and then. Whatever is left we can just merge that down. So now that's part of this layer with her now. Everything's on one layer and this is kind of how I go from painting or from drawing to painting phase. Now I'm no longer going to have that sketch on I will have it in case I need it, but most likely. I'm going to leave it off for the rest of the painting and we're just going to go from here so. Now I can go and paint on Top of the original sketch of the eyes and change them and hopefully improve them and not have to go back and forth between layers to do that I can. Just go from here, so right now. I'm working on a new layer above and on normal mode and I'm just going to paint. I should probably stay zoomed out it's so tempting to zoom in because I'm painting her face and I want to be able to see the details but at the same time. This is uh. This image isn't it just about the portrait. There's also a background that her whole sweater and everything so. I'm gonna stay zoomed out. Until we at least get it further along and then I can look at zoom in. And fix little details and things but I don't think we're like, at that step. Yet we didn't we didn't earn our zoom in you guys, we have to paint more before we can zoom in. That's one of the more helpful things that I started doing with my painting is just staying zoomed out until it's. Until you really need to get it in Polish, it up. And that keeps it just likely that you'll have better proportions. Going on with your painting. Right we do see a little light on her chin down here. And let's start painting in the eyes. I might switch brushes, though I'm painting with A brush that's really difficult to do details because it's so soft. So I'm going to choose a harder edge brush. And here we go. Reading a time study on the salon are taking your time. I'm more taking my time on this one hunji. I'm not planning on working on like multiple paintings. During this stream. I'm going to try to spend more time on this one and take it to a more finished place. I noticed that yesterday yesterday. I was doing some studies these fabric studies and I found them really challenging. And I felt like I needed more time so I'm going to take it a little slower today. Plus, I'd like to actually get a little portrait practice in with this, too, so it's like a double. Study of portrait and. The outfit. Give a little bit more, she's wearing like orange. A bird orange kind of eye shadow, it, fits the autumn vibes around here. I did choose this picture yes. If anybody is you know likes the reference image. You can find it below the stream in the description panel or above the chat and info tab. If you'd like to do a painting with with us you can join in. Yeah, I chose this one. Hi pro designer. I'm doing good thanks how are you? Alright I'm pretty dumb. Sort of anxious to get in there and paint the face. But I'm going to wait on that and spend a little bit more time looking at the picture as a whole and then will zoom in so first thing I want to do is look at the overall shape of her head because looking at it now. I think I added like a whole bunch of poofy hair to the side for some reason I don't know I like painting fluffy hair big, big flowing hair. But. We're going to stay closer to the reference doesn't have quite as much hair over there. So something more like that. And we can go a little bit warmer get some of the lighter colors on the ends of the hair. And we can also just brighten up overall we can go to image adjust. Curves levels these are always to mess with your brightness and contrast levels and just the overall lights lights and darks in the image and you can improve things with that, so we can just brighten things up. You can also go to color balance. We can look at the shadows that we want things to be more you know tended towards any specific color. Maybe we can give a different feel to it or something more accurate. I think it's helpful to do this along the way as you go. I don't know if I like what I did there, but I was kinda just showing the sliders. I think basically the highlights need to be a little bit more cool. That's one thing that I'm feeling in this. Another thing you can do is you can adjust that through the curves also so we could go to red and maybe like tone down the Red Curves, a little bit. Then the blue. Little bit more. Anyway, we've got a lot more painting to do so. Any specific reason about Wednesday streaming. Uhm I just like to stream on a regular schedule. I like to pick a day and. Be able to stick to it, rather than kind of streaming randomly. I know, people have all different kinds of. Schedules and thoughts on that there's a lot of people that stream just like when they have the time. But it helps me to have a schedule so. I like to be able to be here and people if they want can plan to be here if they enjoy the stream. Could you show me what would happen if you do auto color OK? Let's try image adjust? Oh, auto, yeah, auto color there, it is wow. Look how cool that is. It's very, very cool like blue cool. Alright so I want to give a little bit of a highlight to the outside of her head. Just a little bit of a shine, maybe on the hair. I just feel like I'm losing her with the plants behind there, I guess the other option is we could lighten the plants. But. It's just hard to see. See her because she has a dark hair and there's kind of a dark background, so that's a little bit better. OK. That right there was a crazy result, sometimes it looks really good when you use the auto tone or auto color, but other times, not as much? OK, so now we're at the the phase in the painting where it doesn't look so hot, however. Everything is in place. So we can go ahead and just render and have fun with painting it and making it look better. The background is there. The characters there. She's got a lot of work to be done. But she's mainly blocked in the proportions are there and? I find this a good place to be in with the painting as far as like. I feel like I've worked through some of the more difficult parts of the set up and now we can tweak some little things and just carry on. So I'm going to. I'm looking at the reference and I think I missed out on a little bit of like a tilt to her hand. If you guys see that. So. I'm going to. Do that little group will tilt. And. Make a couple adjustments to where things are wall. Everything is still very malleable because we haven't painted a lot of details anywhere. So I don't feel too. That's too precious to adjust and move things around so. For it. Want to move something over. I'm going to do that. And then we can, we can carry on. I wonder why it was so great this is really intense. One thing that I I mistake I used to make was I would get into details, too soon, mostly just because I you know like anyone I didn't like the ugly stage in the painting. You want things to look good, so I had a hard time working around the painting 'cause I would paint. One area until it was more finished just because I wanted to see it be nice. You know, and what I would end up with is if I wanted to make changes it would be kind of difficult 'cause I had already rendered that area. Lots so making a change like that would have been maybe more troublesome. But we're in the place right now where nothing is too detailed so we can move things around. And then when we were like OK, we're good to go then will start. Start painting some nice shading. So I've been using very soft brushes up to now. I think I'm going to soon switch to some brushes that have a little bit more texture to them and like I was talking about the beginning of the stream. I really like the look of sort of traditional painting. In digital work as well so you know imitation of. Oil painting textures, or watercolor gouache? Why not so I'm probably going to go for more of a oil kind of look here. Merge that down. So let's begin I'm going to take a brush called the soft paint round brush and that's because it's something similar to what you would use the hard round Brush War. But it's just got a little bit more of an interesting shape and a little bit more texture than the hard round brush, but it basically serves the same result. Serves the same purpose. And let's start painting on her face. I will zoom in a little bit. I'm going to zoom in on the reference. I have the reference on my other monitor. Let's see maybe I can flip this too. I don't usually. Bother but Let's see this images. Arrange. I don't remember how to do it quickly but it's one extra step. So I hope you guys don't mind if I don't flip that it's just easier for me, I flip my reference on the other monitor my full size reference. I do flip that whenever you see me painting with the canvas flipped I'm not just like. That I'm not just like so brilliant that I can flip it in my head. I am looking at the flipped version. On my other monitor so. Well, after getting after zooming in this is a bit more rough than I thought I think I actually will work with the airbrush a tiny bit more guys before going to the texture brush. This is just going to be easier. And then will start going in with texture so. The airbrushes nice I can add color like this. She has a little bit more warm through her skin than what I have here so we'll start with that. On the eyes and the nose. Um. Mill says in pure ref flip by holding shift alt and dragging the left mouse button in the direction you want to flip. I wonder how many times it will take me to remember that shift alt OK cool. Thank you Mills. Thank you. It's one of those things I gotta commit to my memory because. Probably remember it forget that by the next time Is It. Need to write myself a sticky note. Oh, that was orange, so anyway, yeah, using the The Airbrush to sculpt in give her little shadow under her eyelids. To establish the shape. Up above and below the eyelids. I find the Airbrush and soft brushes really so much more friendly to use for this people have different preferences, you know. I'm I'm kind of at that point where I'm struggling a little bit with deciding making workflow changes because. I do as I was saying, I do like to have a little bit more of that. Painterly, look, but I find that my workflow. I really enjoy working with the airbrush. I like it. It makes me feel almost like I'm creating a 3D model. I just find it really satisfying to get these soft. Shadows and things. So I think my compromise to that is going to be to start. Painting, the using the airbrush method in the early stages, the kind of sculpt in a base for myself and then start using some textured brushes at some point during the? Sort of polishing fees and hopefully get texture that way. We'll see we'll see. I'm still I like to experiment with different workflows and use. These studies in order to do it, so I can try new things. I think he Mills. Well, that's nice. Welcome everybody if anybody is watching or listening and you have any questions. Feel free to ask me. I like to explain as I go. But if there's anything. I'm doing and you're wondering about it, you can just let me know. And also, if you'd like to see or use the reference image. You can find a link to it below the stream or in the info tab. Anyone is welcome to paint along I like to do group studies during my streams. So I am studying this image, doing a little painting of it and if you'd like to also do a study of her. You can take the reference and you're welcome to share whatever you do you can post it in the chat? If you like. OK so this is a before and after of a few minutes of painting with the airbrush so it's still. In the early stages, but you can see that something's happening here we're getting we're getting somewhere. We're cleaning things up. I also like to use the lasso an airbrush combination or things like nostrils and. The space in between the mouth, so let me show you an example. So I'm going to make a selection of the nostril shape. Because generally when you're painting noses an nostrils. You'll get the effect where there's a dark shadow. You're seeing like up inside the nose and so you'll get a dark shadow that kind of fades out so if you make a selection, but select more than you need on the bottom half, so you just get a hard edge on Top you can do something like this. Just using the airbrush to shade in. And then let the bottom the Microsoft sort of dissolve and then deselect and you have something like this. And we need to do more. More work on the nose, but not realize I think it's pretty fast way to do that. Grampa airbrush racer OK and then for the. For the lips for the mouth. You can do something similar and just make a selection tracing along what you want to be the. The bottom of the Top lip for example. And then when you have this election need. And you can hold the shift to add to your selection and all to subtract from it. Once you have your selection. You can then take the Airbrush and just kind of run it along there. And then deselect and you have. Align. Sometimes they'll take me a couple goes you know to decide what shape I want you can use warp and move it around sometimes you get it, the first time. Sometimes not. Um charity has more character thank you. What is your favorite tool in Photoshop except the brush tool? Well, this might be? This might be an obvious answer at the moment but probably the lasso tool probably the last air tool. I guess also having layers of course, I also do traditional art so I. Yeah, in traditional art, I missed having layers for sure. So I mean, you can layer things. But you can't then go and take a layer from your background of your traditional painting and move it around so it would probably be either having layers or the lasso tool. I use those both like obviously constantly. Unbelievable, I was killed myself to make it knows Oh well. I hope that I hope you can use this. I hope you can use this. It's yeah, it was really handy for me. Also, the eyelids. You can do something similar so let me make a selection above the eyelid for example, got a hard edge, there now we can take the. The Airbrush and just go along the edge of the eyelid and deselect so you can see the before and after you can also see that there's a big? Different sometimes in the lasso tool versus the brush that it's not so smooth, sometimes you get little like aliased edges, you can just use the? It's much brush to soften it. Control Z for you read. I know control Z is definitely something I miss in traditional, although to be honest. I don't miss it as much as some other things because I I painted in Gouache, so mostly I can paint over if I make a mistake. So it's not so much the end of the world I missed some of the other convenience tools, even more than controls the older that's of course, a big one. Yeah, so yeah, I'm glad that helps yeah, so you can you can use that kind of method to add it's like a bit of a spray paints kind of approach and you can do it below the lips. I would really suggest, though I mean, depending on what style you want I would suggest using the. Airbrush airbrush lasso tool combination with the smudge tool because you're just going to end up with some really, really hard edges and you might want to have a smudge brush to go back in and soften it. I like the combination of I like having a smudge brush where you can soften in some places an leave a hard edge in other places, if you want to. You don't have to completely soften it everywhere. You can leave leave a hard edge that kind of fades. So. I'm too often like I want to try this, but if I ruin everything. Yeah, sometimes if I'm painting and environment and you have your whole background and then you're going to add like one tree in front like Bob Ross style. That's always. Nerve wracking moments and there's Photoshop. It's like no problem. We can just move it. Erase delay take away the layer and release it. Definitely. OK, so we've got. A face we'd still need to do more here, but It's going I'm just noticing now also her. Her eyelids, I'd like to move them up a little bit more. This is another fun thing to do in photo shop, so I copied her eyelid onto a new layer. There's many ways to do this you can just use liquify tool or something but I just found that I like to do it this way. So I copied her bottom eyelid on to a new layer and just kind of warped it and pulled it up over Top of her eye. A little bit. She just has this little bit of a squint you know it's kind of like the typical model squint going on. And so I didn't really get that in my initial painting. So yeah, I pulled her. I let her eyelid bottom eyelid up over a little bit and I think it gives her a better. You know squint. So that's fine will use that? So let's zoom out, we've been zoomed in for awhile as much as I'm actually really enjoying working on the face. I want to work on this whole image and what I was saying earlier is it's important to work around the image and not get too zoned in on one area and leave other areas neglected in your painting so. I'm going to keep going. But we're going to stay zoomed out and I will paint with the whole scene in mind, not just her, her face. So I will do a little bit more painting on her. Her head, but we're staying zoomed out or staying zoomed out for a bit. And we're going to work on the outfit too. She has this little leaf tucked by her ear, I didn't even paint that in yet. That's going to be something to do soon I think. We see up in between her, her, her apart. So let's give a little peek like that. And maybe a little bit more at the Top of her head. Keep going back and forth 'cause earlier, I had painted in too much. Earlier, I had too much hair. Now, not enough. High rock is how are you? We can add a little bit of machine to the hair, too. There's like a grey grey blue highlight nice shines or her hair and around her part. You can give the look that her hair like sort of curls around. There's a lot of different ways, you can do this since I was kind of showing this whole lasso tool technique. I can show a way that you can use that for this purpose. You can take your lasso tool and make like a shape you can kind of make a squiggly shape. If you want to have a lot of little hair strands, catching the light so you can just kind of. Do this. And maybe some of these curling ones, and then let's pick, a Gray we've got our airbrush and. Just paint in lately. And usually want the darkest part being around the middle of that and then you have. A little. Shine in the hair now in the past. I've done some stylized almost like anime style artwork. San in this case, I would leave the shine very. Sharp. But for something like this, I think it's nice to blur it out a little bit. 'cause I'm trying to paint. Yeah, I'm not trying to paint in the anime style or something at the moment. This reference is not hard it's a really hard. I'm so sorry uh. I'm definitely I'm definitely feeling that this is a difficult one like I keep looking at her and. Yeah, I'm just going to keep going. Hum what did you think of the 2 Wallpapers. I shared in discord? I don't think I saw them Reaper? I'm sorry? You can post one in the chat if you want me to take a look at it. I don't always see everything in there, you can always tag me if you like really want to make sure that I don't miss something though. You guys give me one quick moment I need to grab a tissue. I'm still here. Well, I'll be. I'll be right back. I'll just be a quick moment. OK thanks for waiting. Let me check the link of rebirth shared. Oh, this is cool. So what is the symbol from? It says in the URL Empire emblem, so I'm not sure what that is if it's a game or something but this is really cool. I like the texture on this. It makes it look very old like it's from like an old temple or something. Really really pretty warm and cool colors. Yeah, I like that, a lot, that's a very nice looking wallpaper. OK let's let's keep going on the painting. Let's take a look again at our curves. I feel like I want to. I don't know. I was going to keep painting I do want to darken things but I'm not sure. It was from Star Wars Nice. Some kind of not really super in the loop with Star Wars I've seen like the classic movies. But. It's been awhile. I haven't really kept up with the new ones. OK. Let's Let's go. So new layer I think it is finally time I know I said that earlier, but I think it's finally time I can start using some more interesting brushes. Let's see how it goes. Hopefully it's not going to flatten things out. I find it easier to get a 3D look to my work when I use the airbrush, but I really want to enjoy some more textures in my work so. This was my whole plan. Let's see how it goes. The idea was start with the Airbrush. So you can use it as a tool that I find pretty effective for shading. And then at some point. Like now for example, we're going to switch to continuing our rendering with some textured brushes and there's variety of different brushes. That I have that are supposed to emulate traditional kinds of textures, so I'm just going to. I'm just going to take a couple moments to try things out and find one that I think is going to work well for this type of texture of her sweater. I'm trying your textured brush from your free brushes. Um there's a texture paint and let's see. Rectangle texture. I'm not sure which one exactly you're using I have. I changed the names of the brushes at one point from one of the old versions of the brush pack to one of the newer ones. I changed the name 'cause. I was trying to make them a little bit more. Descriptive some of the original names were not very helpful. Do you only painting or other work in designing only painting illustrate illustration? I don't do design work? I don't really have any specific knowledge in that area, so while I have done a couple. I have done some logos and things in the past they were more illustrated logos. Not very designed logo so for example, I did the type of logo where there was an illustration of the person in the logo like if you know the brands like the Quaker Oats guy or Aunt Jemima or something like that. Those brands that have like a portrait in their logo. I've done a couple like. A few of those type of designs for people that wanted that. But other than that I don't do like a nice clean style logos or that type of design. It takes a whole different area of expertise, which I would. I would it would be really awesome to be able to do. But. Yeah, it's not something that I do. My passion is more in painting, though I do appreciate good design. And I'd super handy to be able to do as well because a lot of artists are also you're kind of your own. You need to be your own brand and marketing and everything so. Being able to create some of those things for Yourself is really nice. That's something that I found a little difficult over the years. OK, so I don't know that I'm really loving this texture, yet, but part of the issue. Is sometimes when you first introduce a new texture? It looks really wrong when there's only one area that's utilizing that texture. Sometimes you gotta commit a little bit more. And before you can really tell what it's going to look like I have the feeling that if I keep going. We're going to get better results. Then just looking at one little corner. Another thing that I have. Learned and I'm trying to put into effect is the idea that you don't have to paint detail everywhere. You can leave some areas pretty smooth and you can focus your areas of detail and texture in places in the painting where well basically there's 2 main places. You can focus your detail and texture. One is anywhere near your focal point, so for example, the focal point will be her face and around her face. The more complicated area of the painting is her hand or face maybe these Flowers. Leaves to the side of her so anything up here. We want to focus more detail and more time and more texture. And so like her sweater near her hand that will be probably the most detailed part of the sweater that we paint. Also anywhere where there's high contrast. Where there's a transition between Shadow and highlight that's also a good opportunity to show texture because the texture becomes more obvious in that area, so those are 2 places where I'm going to try to focus my painting of the texture of the sweater. And we'll see we'll see how that goes. If you end up painting equal texture everywhere, you end up with. Well, either you could end up with maybe like a very, very realistic. Looking painting if you're going for hyper realism or you really want. That level of detail but sometimes it can also detract from your focal point because you really want. One area of painting. One area of your painting to catch the eye of your viewer and be like the area that they engaged with first. And so having that one area be more detailed and more. More textured more contrast more interesting and that's going to benefit you. So there's a lot of good reasons, not to over do it with the detail not to mention we could save some time maybe. I'm flipping my canvas a lot. I do this mostly when I'm painting portraits. I'll still do it. When I'm painting environments. But when I do portraits. That's when you really see me, flipping the canvas. All the time so I hope it's not annoying to watch it. So it helps me see mistakes more easily. When you're looking at something for awhile sometimes you. I don't know if your brain like stop seeing things anymore. When you flip the canvas it kind of tricks your brain into reprocessing the image and you can see, things a little differently. Sometimes that's when you'll notice that something is a little bit wonky. So I've done all this detailing on a separate layer. 'cause I wasn't sure how is going to like it? I didn't know if I wanted to commit to this. Method. One thing you can do is lower, the Opacity and that takes away some of the intensity. I really like, how it looks here. But I'm not a big fan of this area. I think maybe I just started to get more of the hang of it as I went on, but One thing I could do is maybe erase out or soften the shoulder or just take it away. Maybe I should just. Yeah, I get rid of that didn't really like, how it looked. Hey geovanna, um more vector illustration person, but sometimes it miss, this character. That's painted textures, brain do you have any specific tips to help with that? Well, uhm. I'm not very experienced with vector illustration so. I don't know, um about. I mean, I'd love to help but I don't know if I have any good tips for bringing textures into vector illustration just because I don't do much of that. Hum. But. If you're if you're just talking about in painting in general. Uhm I could suggest maybe playing with some different. Playing with some different brushes or playing with some different like you can clip some textures or patterns on to your like if you do more stylized work or if you do more like in vector work. Maybe you can still clip some kind of. Textures are patterns on Top of some of your characters, either like clothing or hair or something where it might fit. So the for flipping the canvas. You have to set up the shortcut. It's not automatically a shortcut by default Sebastian, but if you go to edit. Keyboard shortcuts. You can set it up for yourself, it's under. Let's see I think it's under tools hold on. Let me see if I can find a real quick. 220. No, it's under. Application menus that's right so you can go to image. Flip horizontal so yeah. Application menus. And then Scroll down to image flip horizontal and I set it to control F because I feel like that's pretty easy to remember for flip. But you could pick something else. Now this flips your whole canvas. There's another shortcut. You can also use if you like. You can go to view instead of flipping the whole canvas you can go to view. And there should be a I may have just scrolled past it, but there's a way to flip your view horizontally. And this yeah, here we go flip horizontal you can use this, if you want instead and it will be a little bit easier on your computer to do it. This way or its uses less processing power because it's kind of flipping the view. It's not really like actually flipping your canvas so if you ever are working with like tons of layers and you find that flipping your canvas is causing a big lag you can choose this instead and then? It will be a little bit better. Hey George welcome. OK, so I'm going to keep going. With this little texture up here. But I'm not quite sold that this is the right. But this is the right texture for me to use this feels extremely labor intensive which maybe it just might be. Maybe it might be to paint this way. But I think it's more an issue of I haven't figured out the right balance of. How much texture to have or not have in this in this painting yet? I also have a brush called rectangle texture. That's has some texture to it, but it's more of A. Brush that I used to block things in this could be a nice one because it has a harder edge. So it's not. Going to leave so many of these ragged paintbrush stipends. Thanks anyway, my experiment painting, some textures are vectors using your brushes see how that goes you have that could be fun. Yeah, I'm sorry. I wasn't able to give a good. Good advice for vector painting, but that could be that could be something that might work worth trying anyway, sometimes when you try something new like that, it gives you another idea you know anytime you experiment like that. Even if it doesn't work, maybe trigger some other kind of idea for you. OK, I kind of like this sort of stylised. Pattern. With the square brush. Doesn't necessarily look super realistic but? It has something cool. Um. Jackson says they have the flip canvas shortcut on F4I use it pretty much every 5 minutes or even less. I think I'm using it really often. I think I'm using it really often. Oh. I'm glad I'm not the only one. It's only when I'm streaming is I get a little bit self conscious about it. 'cause I feel like you guys are like watching a little dance over here, she's moving. All you're welcome. Hi Ahmed love your painting Oh. Thank you like you're touching designs is a very kind of you thank you. Today we're doing something a little bit different. Maybe I'm trying to study the. The folds and textures on her sweater, I don't usually paint. I don't usually paint so detailed when it comes to clothing. We were talking about earlier. I usually like to kind of tone down the folds and things, including 'cause. I find it to be sometimes really distracting from the character, but I'm trying to get better with these textures. So we're practicing this anybody who wants to you're welcome to grab the reference image and do a little study with us. If you feel inspired if you like the reference you can join in. And you're welcome to share any. Paintings or sketches, you do. In the chat. I'm going to be working on this for probably a few hours say. Let's see how long has it been. We've been. Working on this for a little under 2 hours. Now we started from a blank page. At the beginning of this stream so if anybody missed the beginning and you're curious how we got here, you can always check it out later after the stream is done. If you go to my page here on Behance. There's a videos tab and you can see all the past livestreams and it's really nice. There's a tool timeline that I have running here. So later when you're watching if you watch the replay. You'll see whatever tools. I'm using the tool timeline is going to show that so there's one really nice thing about watching the replays actually but yeah, you can see this from the beginning, but I'm going to be working on it for a bit longer. I hope to take this through a nice. And Nice. Somewhat level of Polish by the end of stream. Within reason you know, there's only so much you can do with the. 4 or 5 hours but. I think we can I think we've gotten through some of the more difficult parts of this and we can have fun with polishing it up and making it look nice. Now we're just doing texturing. Um Hey bam, how are you? I hope you're having a good day mill says I prefer regular flipping. I think it helps learn more about composition and balance. OK, cool. Well, I'm glad you think I'm glad you feel that way, and it's not annoying. It definitely helps me so. I like this. I like what the texture is doing here, although I have to admit, I don't know if it's coming across to you guys, but the texture. I'm giving to her shirt is making it look almost like she has sequins on her shirt or that it's made from a more reflective kind of material. I don't really mind that so much. My concern is more with making the folds look good, then that the texture of material looks exactly like the reference. It's kind of glamorous. I like it was looking a little shiny. We're given her whole new outfit. We'll see how it goes by the time we end up putting another layer of. Of detailing in my we may end up giving some texture that makes it look more soft again. It's definitely having a better reflective quality right now. So there's a theme here. I don't know if I should bother with it or not. I know I really like painting, shiny textures. They're just fun just fun to paint. So she got a little seem here on the sweater. And. See no problem, including it. All breaking art I'm sorry, you're feeling sick. Well, I guess on the bright side we get to hang out with you today. But I hope you feel better. Yeah, it's nice it's nice. I enjoy streaming here and on switch there's a few things that I really like about streaming on be hands. I was just talking about one a few minutes ago so I'm sorry if you already heard me talking about this. But there's a really cool feature here called the tool timeline behind so some ways of like integrating the stream with photo shop so this plugin is like capturing my tools that I'm using like the colours that I'm picking. Different things like that and. If you watch the replay of the stream later you'll be able to see a replay of along with the video of all the tools that I'm using as I'm using them so if anybody's ever like having trouble following along or you want to learn a little bit more about that. That's a really, really handy tool. But yeah, it's been really nice. Usually, when I'm streaming here on Wednesdays, I take a little bit more of a less of a speed painting approach and I try to. To spend a little bit more time on an individual painting, I do a lot of. Quick studies overall, but I like to take some time and. Go through more of a full process and it's nice to be able to show some more of the finishing. Affects and things and you guys always welcome to ask if I do something and you wanted to know what I did I tried to explain things as I go, but sometimes I miss stuff so. Yeah, if you turn this later on, and off. We're just seeing the progress I think it's really fun to work on the separate layer like that and be able to. Yeah, it's like the little layer visibility on and off and see the progress. It's a bit encouraging 'cause otherwise, it kind of feels like you're just detailing forever, but Hey Sarah, how are you? I was thinking about you the other day. I was drinking some of that rose tea. It's really good it smells really good. Or afternoon, yeah, we are in the afternoon now at least where I am I know a lot of us are in very different places different time zones. I'm in the Netherlands so I'm in. C ET time for anyone wondering. I'm originally from the US so. I spent most of my life in EST time I grew up in Florida and spent most of my life there so. Alright, you also like rose tea, yeah, thanks to thanks to bail. I was introduced to it. How are you keeping the reference image on the left the reference images? I'm using something called pure ref. So. You can Google, it there's the name it's separate from photo shop and it is. You can download it's technically free or you can make a donation when you download it so. It's really, really handy for making reference boards mood boards, putting holding a reference above your other software and things like that. Oh man. I'm sorry bill I had a kind of rough night of sleep couple nights ago. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, no problem. OK, so I'm starting to feel like we've been working on the sweater for a little while now. As I was saying earlier. I like to work around the painting and not spend too long on any one area and then let the other areas kind of fall behind. I want them to all be kind of working up towards a finished place with a relatively equal level of Polish as they go. I still feel like the sweater needs a lot of work. But I probably will just spend a little bit longer on it, and then go back and work on the face a little bit more. It's also just a personal preference thing I feel that I keep from getting bored on longer projects by moving around like that. I think if I if I stick rendering. One area for too long, especially when it's sort of a just a texture like what I'm doing here. I kind of can get a little burned out on that so. We're going to. Move around seeing here soon. Oh my gosh that's so cool red, I didn't realize that about you. That's very interesting. Yeah, it's kind of new to me, but I like it. I've always liked the scent but. OK. So the one area that's bothering me is these shadows here. I think if we can improve. This then I'll be happy to move on. These shadows are just I guess a little bit, too, dark or something. Hum. Maybe it's OK for them to have dark shadows, but not quite that much. I don't know it's just really attracting my attention. Take these little shadows. Jackson hi how are you? Welcome. You guys are welcome to correct me if I miss pronounce any of your names. Please do. Quick question how do you flip image high Andres you can set it up as a keyboard shortcut it's not a default one but if you go to image. Oh, sorry wrong? Don't go to image go to edit keyboard shortcuts and then you can go to panel menus. And then I use. A merit, yeah, yeah, let's see. Am I telling you to go to the wrong place. I literally just did this Oh application menus. OK. Go to application menus. Go to application menus and then you can go through image. Image rotation. I can. Go to flip canvas horizontal and press. CTRL F if you want the same shortcut that I have. I just like CTRL F because it's very easy to remember for flip? It's just one of those things that I set up and then I don't usually have to go back to it. Once you set it up, you're good to go you know. Anyway let's go back to the painting. I just want to try to fix this one area and then we'll. Work on the face of it more. Oh, you're welcome, I hope it helps I use that all the time it's like one of my most used. Shortcuts. You can certainly go to image image rotation flip horizontal you can do it. This way too. But if you use it as much as I do you're probably going to want to set shortcut for it. Well, if anybody is working on this one, I hope it's going OK. I hope it's going well. Even I find that's references. Is a pretty tricky one with a lot of details so? I'm trying to just enjoy enjoy the process. Enjoy the learning process. OK, well, I think I finally I'm going to merge this down you guys that's a big move. Big move so this has been on its own layer, but I think I'm committed enough to this texture. I'm just going to merge it down so my layers, so far consist of the background. The. Person and the sketch, which is now really not used anymore. I have the layer visibility turned off for it, but I'm just saving it because. I don't know sometimes I like to refer back to the sketch at some point. Hi Emily welcome. Flipping is the best thing to check your drawing. Yeah, it's super helpful another thing. I like to do is turn. My artwork into black and white and that will help see what's going on with your values like the darks and lights in your painting before even turning it into black and white. I am already aware that her face needs brighter highlights. I basically have worked on the. The sweater, but not her face for awhile now but it becomes even more obvious if you if you turn your reference into black and white and the. Yeah, if I look at the reference. Versus my painting, you can really see the difference it needs more contrast and more brightness, but it will get there. So Hi Richard Welcome. Oh, Noes avenged I'm sorry. Thanks Oliver I'm glad you like it. It's going somewhere took some liberties on this one. I do not blame you and that's not a bad thing. OK, so. I'm just going to have a little sympathy here and think about my next moves. OK, we're going to work on her face. We're going to zoom in. I'm going to zoom in I try not to zoom in too much. But when it comes to painting the face. We're going to finally do it. So we will make a new layer and paint on that layer to make adjustments and things because I think it's just feels a little safer feel a little safer in case we don't like what we do, we can. You know change it, so we don't have to commit yet so her finger as you can see in the reference or fingers, pushing in under her cheekbone kind of where your Kind of where you're like, maybe a dimple would be anyway, so. I'm just going to. Give her a little bit more dramatic. Like impression of the finger. The sweater texture is amazing. I love it. Yay I'm glad you like it. I feel like it looks a bit more reflective than the photo, but I kind of like I think it's kind of cool, it looks. I don't know I think has a glamorous kind of look. It's a little. It's a little bit different, maybe but I like it so I'm going to go with it. Um wanted to paint the girl with the Yellow Shirt but then you said. You chose this ref and I was like OK. I'm gonna do this Oh. I'm I picked the hard one. It is a pretty one, though, isn't it? Uhm I have some ideas, I have some ideas bail. I don't usually. Riville them anyway and when we get closer I will I will. Maybe talk about some things. But I usually like to have mostly surprise anyway. But yeah, that's crazy that that is. Coming up so soon. Looks like crushed velvet, but also it's needed. Well, thank you. So I'm using the airbrush to start with when I feel a little bit happier with the overall. Color shading highlights on her face then I will probably switch to a harder brush for more texture. But right now, we're still I'm like still trying to be satisfied with her face structure and overall where the colors and things are so once that's sorted out, then will probably move away from the. The Airbrush just like we did with her jacket sweater. So she has a bit of a shadow under her, her eye and it's not like she has. I mean to me, it just looks like the shape of her. As the shape of her eyelid. It's not so much that she has circles or bags under her eyes. It's a combination of her eye shape and that she's squinting a little bit. So if we do want to get that Squint feeling then we have to go ahead and like include this shadow under here. So we don't over do it. 'cause then I think it will make her look like she's tired or something. But a little bit of it is just going to give us a proper amount of squint I hope. I thought it was a waffle texture, but it's not it might just be hungry. I could go for a waffle right now, I don't blame you. I do not blame you. And Hey Clever, Give a little highlight to her nose kind of pop that out, a little bit. So I want to get this little wing of her nose over here on this side, so that her nose looks more symmetrical. Yeah, before and after. Maybe I invented things a little too much over here. So I'm using airbrush I'm just color picking I'm holding alts to bring up the color. Picker and dragging colors, a little bit back and forth across each other, too, like blend the colors together and. Yeah. Quite refined for 2 hours of work very nice glad I got to see the sweater details all thank you. Thank you. Yeah, you're right, it's not too bad for 2 hours earlier. I was feeling a bit. Oh man she had. We had a bit of a ugly stage at the early part of this painting with the you know, blocking in her face and everything you know how it is. But. We're getting through we're getting through there, I'm feeling better about it now thank you. Little shadow to the eyebrows. It's also nice to use I was talking about this earlier, but you can use layer blending modes like multiply and that way. When you add a little bit more shadow for example, around the. The eye or the eyelid if you want to add some more depth to that it will add the darkness, but not completely cover? What you've already painted as if you were painting on a normal layer that might just kind of cover it up, but using multiply or something it still leaves that detail there and just kind of adds to it. So I like to use it. When I've already painted a bit and I just want to modify things slightly. And her mouth definitely needs. I need to get in there and paint you can actually see. Sort of into her, her mouth a little bit her lips are parted so we're going to want to get zoom in there and paint that. I'll pick a little bit more of a saturated color for around the lips. So are you guys at all familiar with. Color zones when it comes to painting portraits or faces or anything like that. This is something that was relatively new to me over the past couple years I started learning about this. Via just online tutorials and things and I can show a quick example of what I'm talking about 'cause I think it might be easier than. Trying to Explain it with words. So this would be a quick example. Of the color zones if you see if you take a look at paintings, especially like classical oil paintings. You'll see that. Even though this is a very dramatic. Example, a lot of times these areas, the face will have a slight tint to them. I can put the link to this in the chat in case anybody wants to look more closely. But the idea is to give a little bit more life to the skin. You can pay attention to those zones when you're shading. And sometimes it's just it can be overdone. So you don't want to go too far with it, but I've noticed that can really help. Struggle on the lower part of the face like shading the sides of the mouth. Chin lower cheek. Part yeah that's really hard in this one revenge because of her hand. Blocking I should actually start painting her hand next because surprise surprise. That's the part. I'm procrastinating on and I can't really figure out any of the other areas of behind there. Until I figure out how much the hand is going to be blocking for example, but Well let's get to that, but well before we do that. I'll do one will put a layer on either overlay or soft light and we can do a little bit of shading with the color zones in mind, so for example, we can give a little bit more yellow Hue through the upper part of her head. The knows we can go a little bit of pink. Really useful the head color map, yeah, Pedro is really interesting and I've seen examples. If you guys are curious to look into that more you can also find online you can find color Maps for things like the hands as well, and legs and all areas of the body have these different tendencies towards a slightly different hues. And the blue one is a little bit odd but. Yeah, so here's a before and after before and after. You can lower the opacity a little bit, but it just gives a little bit more life to the skin. Your right hand cover so I used this. It's to make my hand glide Morse movie on my tablet. I'm using a Wakame Centriq 22. And it has a glass screen an I find that sometimes my hand will like kind of just get stuck a little bit on the glass. If you wear a glove or something then you can draw very smoothly and it's more comfortable. It also helps prevent smudges and things on the tablet, but really for me, it's more of a just ease of ease of painting. The reason that I wear it. Alright so let's start painting her hand. Finally we will do this on a new layer. Of course in case case. You don't like how it looks. I'm going to use this soft brush from earlier and. Just start trying to block in the individual fingers a little bit more and I'll paint around the outside. Of them, yeah, we just want to establish establish the shape of the fingers a little bit better. So this one is a little tricky. I'm going to keep them pretty light. Until the next step. So one thing that I found it really helpful with drawing fingers and hands of a specifically fingers is to think of them more as I used to think of fingers more rounded, but now I think of them more in as like. Cubes are rectangles like for example. Speaker brush that's less transparent this side of the finger. Is separate from or has a sharp edge from this side? It makes the fingers more easy to read if you can really separate the Top and the side of them so there's there's different ways to go about this. But just even thinking of it. That way when you're working can help I think. The very tip, is going to be a little bit more rounded but. The rest of the way down the fingers. Is more of a solid shape? So I'm going to go back to the lasso tool airbrush for this. Let's make a new layer. And grab the Airbrush got my lasso tool. So I'm going to make a selection tracing around the shape of the finger going to start with the furthest one. And get the whole finger. An on a new layer. The left side is a bit. Darker and then towards the her finger her hand is as it's facing towards us. The light as is hitting her cheek is also affecting your hand the same way so that bright light will also hit her finger. So we get this kind of highlight so we get this side of the finger and Shadow and the side facing us in the light. And if we deselect you have something like this now, it's going to look a little bit, silly at first until we go in and paint details. It's going to look like plastic. Hot dog fingers or something but it's OK. We will we will make it better. It's just a step one and I think it's a little easier to do it. This way, so let's go to the next finger. An I will just do the same thing again take the lasso tool and select all the way will select the knuckle at the end and select all the way around the finger. And then Take a you can either do this on a separate layer from the first finger. If you want or on the same layer kind of just depends on how confident you feel about this. And then choose what color you want for the shadow. And just start painting that in and then as the. As you go around to the side you can shift to the highlight. So we can see where it's kind of hitting this knuckle here. Bring it down like this. Tee time enjoy your tea. Here's I'll have a sip as well. OK, so if I deselect then we have another finger and I will also. Select this space in between the fingers here. Put a shadow. We can add a bit of red to it 'cause there's kind of a glow from the skin. So of course again modify things if you can give me made the Anatomy, a little off, you can just change that, especially if they're on separate layers is pretty easy to modify. OK let's go to the next one next finger. Make a selection this one we don't really see the knuckle 'cause. It's kind of tucking under the sweater. I think my sweater needs to go up a little bit higher actually 'cause it's not going to cover that. Alright we'll get to that next. So we see the angle of the finger here. And this one is all pretty light so. We'll go from light to later this finger is getting really bright if you look at the photo. The hand and the sweater are like the same bright NIS the finger. Colour and her skin is reflecting. Really really bright there so. You can go really bright. So I'm going to go to my lower layer with the sweater on it an make a selection. Of a big piece big chunk of sweater and bring that layer on Top. We're going to go to edit transform warp and just kind of pull it up like this. Just drag it up like that, so now this is on Top of the layers with the. On Top of the. The fingers. Let's try one more time it it transform warp. Anne will decide how much I think I went a little overboard. That's enough OK. So let's go back to the fingers finger painting next one. So we see a little bit of shadow in between them here. So something like this and then the last little pinky finger. Comes out and down. We can be really casual with painting this now, especially because we have that piece of the sweater. So I don't have to worry about that. You have to worry about the edge, I can just kind of paint right through its covered so. Pinky's a little odd. But this is basically just a block in the basic. Shading of the fingers. Let's merge these. So these are all the fingers on one layer. We can make a layer underneath of that and do a little bit more shading under under the fingers. For example, before we merge it down to the face. It's more easy to paint underneath there right now, so. Anywhere, where her fingers are close to her skin. You might want to put in a little bit of extra. Like sort of drop shadow or? Something like that. Nice Cup, Oh thank you my Penguin. OK. Well, I think I'm ready to merge down the hand. If you think it's too bright or doesn't look natural. You can lower the opacity a little bit, it kind of blends with what was already painted there emerged that down. And then I'll also merge the sweater, so we're back to our two layers. We're back to her and the background and our little sketch, which were not really using anymore. OK. So let's go back to painting her face and her hand. We can just kind of go back in and now like refine what we've done a little bit and add like for example, there should be some little wrinkles at the creases of these. In these with these fingers. Here. You just Polish, it up. Polish it up, we can add a little bit more shadow between these. Knuckles and might even use the lasso tool here to block it off. He's a smudge brush to clear that a little bit. Got a little bit weird with that one finger now. OK, I think I see the problem. Let's choose a brush with some more a little bit more of a hard edge. And we need to define this. Sebastian says you prefer always to merge it has some advantage because I would have like a million layers. But it makes my file very heavy. I used to have that same thing Sebastian I used to save ice the kind of horrid layers a bit. There are advantages and disadvantages to both merging layers. Merging layers more often can help with what you're talking about your file will be less heavy. It won't take up as much hard drive space and it's just easier to work with you don't have to deal with as much lag. Potentially. If you are experiencing that depending on what kind of processing power you have with your computer. Uhm but for me if I'm talking about it nothing to do with technology and just to do with painting. I like to merge more often because I find that it helps me commit and move on. I used to have a very, very picky kind of slower way of painting and part of it was because of having all those layers. I would really kind of overthink decisions before making them I would want to save layers to constantly be able to make changes to things and there are advantages to that, but within reason. So for this painting, I think it's beneficial to me to have the character on a separate layer from the background. It makes it easier to make changes to them. Separately, an it's an advantage. I think to keep them separate but beyond that. I don't think it helps me to have like her hair on a different layer her hand on a different layer. I only keep them on different layers when it's I think useful to me to have them that way, and then at that point I will. I will just merge them when I feel like I like what I've done at that point. I'll merge them and move on and sometimes it is. Most of the time I think it's a good choice for me for my workflow every once in awhile I regret. The merge and I'll be like, Oh I wish I had that separate that would have been more useful, but most of the time I don't mind if I need to separate something I'll just use the lasso tool select it and just like copy it. You know layer new layer via copy or control J. You can separate something on to another layer so usually that'll be good enough for me. Mill says will you be illustrating the free part of the sweater or leaving that out? Do you mean like the little strands and things? Like if you look really close up. There's Tiny Little. Little strands like this, it depends I don't know to me. That's kind of like a finishing effect. So it just depends on how. I don't consider that like a super high priority compared to other things that I want to work on in the painting that would be like if I had enough time. Maybe I would add that in but that is not super super important to me because I'm not really going for like hyper realism. With my art, I am happy if you get the effect. From a distance like so from here, you really can see some of the fuzzy effects, but for the most part. You know you're not really going to see it so much until you zoom in so for me. If my painting reads well from like a full screen size that I'm happy. I'm probably not going to get into so, so many of the really minute. Details just 'cause I doubt there will be time for it, but We'll see what happens. Pedro said what really helped me about messy layers was to make whole pieces in one layer only just it was on an actual canvas also wait were you doing, traditional painting. But yeah, I've heard of a lot of artists doing like single layer painting challenges and things and I have done some of that in the past 2 with like quick studies nothing that I spent 2 too long on but. Yeah, I have done some things like that, and I think it's a good way to learn. A different workflow and maybe you like it, maybe you don't. I don't think there's like a right or wrong way, necessarily for certain art styles. It makes a lot of sense to keep things separate if you're doing something very clean and you have like a line art layer and then other clean layers. It's going to be really silly to merge them. Um let's see. Breaking arts those along time ago, adopted minimal minimum layer mindset after watching one of your streams. Now I work. A lot faster and work with confidence. That's awesome. I'm really glad to hear that it definitely helped me paint with more confidence. See it's not some leaves into your fabric folds. That's like the that's helping me get through it's helping me get through you know what I mean? Jackson says my take for now, let's see. Oh my gosh. That is amazing. Oh my gosh, Jackson. I gotta say, though this is awesome, like OK. This is a clever idea it looks good. It looks really good, I especially like this texture in the background. It kind of zig Zags in towards her and it kind of somehow echoes this. Zigzag in the fan compositionally this is really pretty love that gold reflective texture, the sweater looks really nice. Yeah, this is well done and being that this was not really a portrait study. It was a study of. Painting fabric folds. I think you are in the clear to block the face-off if you choose. Yeah, it's certainly a lot nicer looking than just leaving her face completely blank so that was a good compromise. Very clever pro tips how to avoid painting their face. Get really good at painting fans. I love it. Nicely done. So yeah, if any of you guys are watching and you'd like to join in with the painting like which accent said. You're welcome to join you also look like they just relax and hang out. But it's always fun to see different artstyles attempting the. The study reference. A lot of different takes on. On the theme. OK, so yeah, let's keep going. I'm going to just paint around the face and neck. I haven't really done much with that, but we actually do see the sweater back here. Some little details like that. It doesn't need to be super super clean. I'm OK with a little bit of a painterly effect. Pokey says out of Big Fluff of her in front. That's true Pokey Yeah, we can do suddenly it's very windy and there's like a rare swallowing like this Oh no. There's there's a lot of. Yeah, I've just hairs a cover I would just be honest. I've used her to couple cover up things I don't want to paint before for sure. Usually, it has to do with the neck. Anatomy and stuff like that, like just put a little hair there. Right yeah. I think every artist is guilty of that at some point. The classic hands in the pockets and stuff. You should see the other work in progress bar, Clovis started. There's not going to be a lot of faces. I don't blame you well. The thing is, it's very distracting from the. From the fabric like. It takes a lot of time to paint the face well and if you're trying to study something different. Then you kind of way away that and see if it's really worth it. She has a ponytail what about now. Yeah. Like you're putting that in your Commission rules, no ponytails. No characters with ponytails no characters with hands. OK, maybe we should paint this leaf up by her face because I'm just noticing. I don't know what to do around this area, she's got a little leaf. It's a decorative leaf. It looks like it has glitter on it or something it's really pretty. I'm curious if they made that it looks similar to the leaves that are. From the plants behind her. So I wonder if that was. DIY project or something this is really cool. Alright well, I'm just going to hand paint this little special, special tricks. If you want you could. Sketch it in first on a separate layer draw sketch and then paint it in. Sometimes I'll do that. Also, another tip, is sometimes for something like this, you can paint it if you're if you're just looking at the silhouette shape. You can paint it in any color and then modify that color you can use. You can use a? Block transparency or clipping mask to paint within this so if you want you can just choose a color. That's actually easy to see because the color of the leaf is like somewhat close door skin color so this is a little easier to see what you're doing, and then you can quickly change the color. There's no reason, it needs to be painted in the color that's going to be. So use my eraser to cut back in make some more interesting shape. And it looks crazy, but I think when we shade, it in it will look like a leaf. That's what we're hoping for. OK. So now we can lock the transparency press the little checkerboard icon up here and we can grab the airbrush or any brush and you can just fill in and only color so we're going to go for gold look. For this leaf so. When painting gold, it's important to note can look at the reference real quick goal when something looks gold. There's usually a lot of different hues involved in that thing so see, there's like yellow gold. There's like a bronzy orange. Sometimes there's like green tones. Gold objects usually have a lot of different little colors, reflecting its metallic it reflects the colors around. It also and if you want it to look shiny, then we want to put some areas of high contrast, so really brighten really dark areas. So, just picking ever just picking a color that looks gold is never going to quite do it. We've got to think a little bit more. So I think a little bit differently for that. So I will start just shading in based on the reference where I see some different colours, so there's more Brown and. This orangey red. I'm going up through more yellow gold. And at the end going a little bit more towards Green. But it's generally going to be like in olive green. The saturated kind of olive green that you see in gold jewelry and stuff, it's not usually like a bright green. OK so that's layer one. Let's Make a new layer and paint. I'm going to get a different texture brush. And colour pick from what we already have and let's go a little bit darker. And I want to start drawing the center line of belief this little ornament, she's wearing it has. You know the classic veins of the leaf kind of shape coming out like this. Something like that, you can also do this on a multiply layer if you want a more intense effect that could be nice. I will create a clipping mask so that I don't have to worry about painting in the lines. So that layer is attached onto the original. Sheep. Love how you splashed a few colors that it turned into a leave it really it really helps. It looked so crazy before it had any shading on it. Because I guess the colors in the shading help give the little bit more of the look of. Foreshortening. Alright I'm going to lower the opacity of that a little bit more 'cause I don't really like love love it. But it's a start. Make a new layer and do the same thing again. Sometimes these things just take a few. Whew. Steps. So I'm going to start adding in some of the highlights, though we want to start bringing in some of those bright. Bright reflections. So it's a little bit glittery. We've got some little glitters Here in there, so I'm just going to. Popping these little sequin effects. And over here. So again for something to look shiny. We need to go high contrast, so that means not just these bright lights, but also. Some. Some darker. Darker little flex also. So I am again, I'm using layers here. This is on a separate layer. It looks very because I've detailed this a lot more than anything around it. It's really stealing our attention away from her face because it's so detailed and crisp with all these hard edges and like noisy, so as soon as we're done with this. Leaf we're going to go back and work on her face more and detail that gives some little shines. Actually, we could probably just go ahead and do that now and come back to the leaf for more leader. Yeah, OK, so we've got that I've got the leaf. For now. And the good thing about this is now we can have her hair tucked nicely behind there and I think it's going to look a lot better now, it gives me some idea what I'm doing with the hair, so for example, let's go back to the brush. I was using now we can have. You know this kind of. Affect that it's a little bit of like a pin. A hairpin or something. Wet brush it used for the shiny things I used the rectangle texture brush at a very small size, so I was just basically making little square. Those square dots with it. You guys can find my brushes below the stream in the description panel or above the chat in the info tab. There should be links to my brushes in both places. The brush I was just using their is just part of my basic. Brush pack that's free to download if you want to check it out. Alright I will leave the leaf on its own layer. Still, because I might want to do some shading under it, or move it around so I'm not ready to we're not ready to commit to the leaf yet but. Let's keep going and keep painting her face so it's time to put some. For some sharp details here so we're going to, I'm using the wet paint brush. It looks like this. It's a cool brush, but it took me awhile to get used to working with it because you kind of if you paint like this, or like this do you see how the darker side of the brush will be at the Top or bottom so it's really nice for doing a little bit of shading like for example, if I want. The underneath of the main part of the brush to have like a little bit of a shadow. It kind of automatically does that, but you have to make the brush stroke in a certain direction. Otherwise, it's going to be opposite. So, sometimes I have a little. The controls the a couple times, so I figure out what I'm doing but I like this brush a lot. For that effect, I think it's really nice. And it looks very to me, it looks. Like. Real paint paint strokes. The leaf looks magical thanks I'm glad you like it. I I like to generally stay pretty soft with eyebrows and things but we'll see. Let's see. Give a little bit more. Crisp detail to the eyelid. And the lower one and sometimes I will also. Paint in like a little bit of pink in the eyelid like a color pic from her lips. 'cause there's going to be subtle amount and let's go darker. See the corner of the eye where you have, like tear duct. Sometimes you'll see a little bit of pink there so sometimes I paint that in it kind of depends. Have you painted your pic Oh like a self portrait? Um not anytime recently I mean, I've done some self portraits like in my life. But it's been a long time. So I don't have any. Any recent ones to show you. So this is such a dark line that I'm painting on Top. It's like really changing her face. You can lower the opacity a little bit if it's too much and you don't want to cover up so much what you've done before. So I'm using color that's not quite pure black, but it's pretty desaturated. But for the lips, I might want to choose something a little bit more like a dark warm red because even in the shadows. We still often have a little bit of saturation to the color. I do have fun painting portraits. Once I get into it. I find the early stages kind of rough, you know. I want to get into it. It's fun fun to get in here and paint little details and things. So her eyes are Brown my version of her eyes are very Gray, so far. I'd like to give them a bit more warmth in. Saturation like depth, so it's coming here with some deeper Brown. And. Darker up. And the Top under the eyelid. Again, I'm painting a little bit more in like a semi realistic kind of. Style I'm not trying to go for a very, very realistic painting style. It's a bit of- from that proportions wise, but I just kind of enjoy enjoy painting this style. It's kind of like a little bit of an idealized realism innocence. That a lot of times semi realistic style will have. Some details left out just kind of smooth things over a bit. So we don't get super super into each skin pore or like tiny little hairs and stuff like that. I will include some, but it kind of just depends on. What I think is adding to the picture and what I think looks nice. And if I think it's distracting or it takes away something that I won't do it. Let me give a little bit more. Turn to the corner of her mouth. Can I share my tree painting process? Of course I would love to see it? So you can post it in the chat. So I want to actually paint her teeth. Always, a scary idea every time came from pizza can end up looking very creepy. But we're not going to get Super Crisp or super detailed with it. I'm just going to paint. I colored pick from her eyes to get a little bit of that kind of off white color. It's actually pretty dark. Look how dark the color is this is what I'm painting her teeth right now, but it's just all relative colors. All relative so compared to the colors around it. It kind of looks white or like a possible color of teeth. Let's see your scared why let me see. Oh my gosh, what are you scared of? What are you scared of this is under his painting? That she's working on and there is nothing to be scared of look at these beautiful details and the colours. You chose for the more cool like blue greens in the shadows and then the warmer yellow greens and the sun. It looks really good, he putting a lot of time in detail into this. Yeah, nothing to be scared about. Yeah, look at that look at that I really like the depth that you kept these silhouettes. Like edit distance so you can really feel like these plants are kind of closer to the viewer. Yeah, it's looking really good don't you worry thing. It's looking really good. I'm very happy with it anyway. Can add a little bit more saturation to the lips? And I might change her. What's the word expression alittle bit. I don't know. I like to draw people that are smiling have a little happy smile or smirk. I mean, you can always draw the kind of. You know serious model pose and expression and everything. But I don't know. I just think it's a little bit more uplifting to look at. Like to draw a little smile. I should really practice. Some other types of expressions. Maybe that something will study together someday guys. Different facial expressions like more extreme ones. I think that would be something good to do. I'm just noticing now that I should actually if I want her to look at us and not that she's looking far to the side. I need to move her. I a little bit from where I placed it. You actually can see if you look at the reference. It's possible to see a little bit of the white of her eyes. On the Corner in the corner. Face expressions I run. Oh my gosh. I know it's it's not really it's not really my. My comfort either I have, like a few types of expressions that I generally like to paint and that's mostly because the type of paintings. I like to do are generally. Just being just being honest, I like to paint fantasy scenes. I like to paint if I do paint characters. I kind of like to paint. Like a peaceful scenes like elves or fairies or something magical and just relaxing kind of scenes and I don't usually paint a lot of dramatic expressions or Super. Yeah, I I go with fairly peaceful happy kinds of environment in my paintings, so most of the time I don't really need to. Paint crazy expressions, however, I feel like it's also just a good thing to have make your skills a little bit more well rounded. So. Anyway, OK, I had to move her. I ended up repainting a lot of it, but it's OK, I could have. Notice that earlier, but now she's looking at us. Poker face is my favorite. Yeah, well OK, I will just be honest. I think it's really important when you're 1st starting painting portraits to stick with basic facial expressions. Maybe some people would disagree with me, but I feel like it's good to work first at just trying to get the proportions right and put the right. The anatomy in the right place and not try to do any crazy expressions right off the bat so for me. I was still for awhile. I was just kind of like working on my basic basic anatomy. I think maybe it can be. Now that could be something to do soon some different expressions. But I don't think that's something that you need to run into if you're 1st starting to paint people. I think maybe it's good to hold off on the crazy expressions of 1st. So I'm going to, I painted the eye on a separate layer and I'm going to erase out a little bit of what I did on the eyelids around the eye and leave just what I modified in the center with the move of the people in iris because I kind of liked my original eyelid painting, but I want I still want to move by over so. OK. Let's let's continue. Sorry. We repainted the whole I OK, so let's let's start with some finishing things on the ice machine touches. So just go to the iris over here get that. In the right spots and. We can add some. The leaf is going to. The leaf is taking the painting through another level, yeah, we have to match the leaf now. I'm just kidding. We don't have to make everything quite that detailed. Once once we decide on. Finishing details for the face. Go and paint the face and the leaf, a little bit more to match each other better. But I was planning on doing more details of the face. Anyway. But it's surprising how much a little bit of shining texture can make a big difference, so for example, when we add that the lights to the eyes. That's going to make a big, big change before we get to that. I want to add a little bit more saturation. There's some shadows that I have around her eye on this side for example, and it just looks really almost like I don't know almost dirty. I don't like it when. Shadows look like that I feel like that. Probably I've done something wrong value. Wise, like the shading darks to lights and I can try to add a little bit of saturation, but that's only going to fix so much. Let's make a new layer and figure out what I've done. That makes this look dirty over here. Zoom out zoom out. Oh my gosh. Gotta zoom out, I'm. Going to make some bad choices if we don't look at this from more of a distance. Better. We can have a little bit more shadow coming from the. Hi Bro, Down here 'cause we got a little bit of an angle view. And she has some little shine on the eyelid here. Make up. I think it's better. OK finally let's add. Some highlights so I'm going to start with the Airbrush and just choose. Hey white closer to white color and maybe a little bit cooler. For the the I were going to get a little bit more roundness to the eyeball by putting. Brighter area. Closer to the The iris. Is it possible to see the values after you finish working on yes? Also, they will change a little bit more as I'm about to put like some final highlights and shiny things. But if we turn the painting into black-and-white this is what it looks like. And I can also see the. With the reference looks like here. So there's quite a big difference. But I think value wise the difference isn't too bad. I can definitely be brighter in the face and we're lacking some like noise detail. But. To study and do you feel like? I'm learning something. Not really. Well, that's nice to hear Andre I think that's a good sign. I think that's a good sign. I don't need to make a new layer every time I'm being making too many layers OK. Let's paint. The shines in the eyes. Finally we waited so long for this moment. Alright Here we go? I'm using the brush in my brush pack called wet paint. I like this one for making these little shines. There's I'm just going from the reference. There's the shines in the eyes are broken up into a bunch of little dots, sometimes you get like one big dot. There's also little shining down here. This makes the eyes look really glacis. So it's up to you like how many you want to put in. How intense you want to go with that? I'm also going to add some eyelashes now. I try to stay away from adding a ton of individual eyelashes. A good tip, I learned is try to paint the eyelashes as if they're wet like if you ever seen someone get out of a pool or shower or your own eyelashes for example. How they'll stick together and kind of clump up like this? That's a good way to paint eyelashes. Sometimes it looks a little bit more. A natural when you kind of like space them evenly and or or have a whole lot of them it feels. Feels. A little bit better to kind of clump them together, most of the time from a distance. Also, you're only going to really see it kind of like that, you're not going to see so many individual eyelashes. From a distance so. Something think about trying to give him a nice curve. And the bottom eyelashes can show a lot about the angle. The angle that they're coming out of the eye. This will not die. But you know the eyelid, yeah, so it'll give a lot of information about the direction so it can really help make the eyelid look more rounded if you turn the eyelashes. As you go around see what I mean, like turning the direction of them. I usually like to only put the eyelashes kind of around the edge. But. Oops. OK. So. Think about this. I'm going to keep going with some more details, finishing up the face so for example, the corners of the mouth. Anywhere that we just want a little bit more detail and sharpness. We can just kind of go over with a hard edge brush and. Paint that in. I don't think I will paint like a space between the teeth or anything like that. I think it works well enough to just show the color of the teeth back there, if you start painting, too many individual teeth that kind of can look creepy but. Haley art welcome good morning. How are you? I think I will add a little bit of detail to the eyebrows. Just a little bit one thing that's fun is you can color pic from the skin. An kind of pull that color in towards the eyebrow versus just you know the opposite and bringing eyebrows outside of the eyebrow shape. You can also sort of cut in like that to put a little bit of space. It's all very in fashion now to have a little bit of bigger eyebrows and more natural eyebrows. It seems so we can give her. Some. Some more detail there. Hey Karen, how are you welcome? I'm glad you could make it. We're doing some sort of polishing effects on. Portrait here. Ah Tanager birds. I'm honored. Thank you for coming over here to catch the stream. I hope you're doing well today. Let me zoom out. Let me zoom out. Here's our painting, so far. You can see the reference here it doesn't look exactly like her, but My goal was just to do a good job with the portrait just to make a nice portrait. Semi realistic. Sort of style and. And to practice on the. Folds fabric folds, and things now the sweater that I've painted it doesn't necessarily look like the exact same type of fabric as what she's wearing in the reference but. Up. As long as the folds are good then I'll be happy. We're going to do a little bit more on this and I'm just looking at her face. I think I need to. Do something with this guy over here. I'm going to copy it onto a new layer and maybe I need to move it over or make it bigger or both. I don't know. Seems like her eyes like I painted her eyes like farther apart in my painting than they are in real life. And that's bothering. I think it's a little bit better. Yeah, so I'm just modifying some of the facial features. I painted too, hopefully being a better proportion. The bit maybe a bit late for that, but let's just keep going well will zoom out for awhile and paint. From here, so I'd like to get more of a consistent feeling of on the whole painting. I feel I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about, but when I zoom in for awhile. And then I zoom out sometimes I feel like I just don't have a consistent painting throughout the whole scene. Sometimes it's like I just want to want to work around and get the same detail level everywhere and the the area. I was just working on when I was zoomed in looks good. But we need to work on some other areas and get things just working happily together again. Ah, thank you. Thanks Karen it's going good. It's going good. It's been good painting day so far. No complaints. What program do you use to keep the reference photo always visible it is called pure ref? I'm going to type it in the chat just in case that helps because you might want to look I might want to Google, it. But it's pure raff it's Super Handy. You can. Use it for reference boards and mood boards and things but mostly what I use it. For is just what you see here holding the reference up there, especially when I'm when I'm streaming. I'm going to make a new layer and put it on multiply mode. I'm going to clip that on to my layer of the person and that way I can do some shading an? I don't like that color. But I think it does need to be darker. We paint more after this, I'm going to work on this painting for a little while longer. But I'm probably not going to start a new painting today. I just want to be able to Polish this one a little bit more. That's true from general to particular otherwise you lose the focus. Yeah, I feel like that's what happened a little bit here so. Let's zoom out an let's paint from this distance also I'm going to try to flip this OK, there, we go. Going to do some painting from this distance. So I just want to put a little bit of shadow underneath her hair and underneath her arm and just. Just in a couple of places. That I think could use a little bit more depth. I don't want to go too far with this so I have it on a separate layer. An I can turn the layer on and off or lower the Opacity. So I think that's what I'll do is just lower it to about 36% or something. OK, so now we can go back into painting so I'm going to grab a harder edged brush and just continue on with what we were doing way back when we were painting the? The sweater so I'm just going to go back to that hand painting, some of the textures and even though it feels. Um. A little bit difficult to be so zoomed out and an painting something detail like this. I think it's important to stay zoomed out while I paint the sweater details, especially near the edges of the canvas. We don't want to get too. Crisp here so I'm just going to paint it from this. Distance. How much longer is the stream I'm not surely art to be honest? I am having a hard time estimating? How long this is going to take. I don't do a lot of. This paper. Portraits exactly so I'm not 100% sure, but I would suspect. Another. Half an hour to hour maybe. Probably half an hour is a bit of a short estimate based on what I have to do next, but it will depend how smoothly things go it. I'm just going to keep painting and take my time and I don't have an exact plan, but it seems like it's almost done. But I also know myself and we might run up to we might come up with some other. Things we want to do and take a lot longer. So. I don't I don't know some days when we do landscapes for example, I have alot. Better of an idea. Ahead of time. Hey, how are you keep going OK we're going to keep going for a bit longer anyway. OK, so we have some horizontal stripes on the right side or horizontal stripes on the left vertical stripes on the right the pattern on her sweater. So I'm just following that. The sweater looks shiny, I know it really does it reminds me of like? I don't know something, you to wear on like. And New Years or something I mean, if you were going to, if you were going to wear sweater like this, you don't want to get a nice shiny one like this. Because of these little marks they look kind of like sequins, but It was sort of a happy accident. It just kind of started turning out this way, and I liked it so I figured why not? There's no rules it has to be. Affori looking sweater. Can be shining one? As long as the folds look good. That's why you're thinking of yeah that's what it reminds me too. I don't know that it necessarily makes sense for her to be wearing this like in the forest but. It's fine and it matches her imagines her leaf. Although I wonder what it would look like if we made her leaflike closer in color like a little bit less. You know made it more of like this page color. I don't know. Can be saturated a little bit less? Maybe that's more natural. I don't know in the reference is very pretty how the leaf. Looks. Happy accidents are the best, yeah, sometimes it's fun to just go with it. That's how you discover some really awesome. Things sometimes, and your painting trying stuff and then. Suddenly, something happens, and you're like well, I didn't plan that but I like it. She can wear whatever she wants in the forest. That's true. I like to paint a lot of like elf type characters and things like that. And certainly we can wear whatever they want a lot of times. I like to think about giving them You know sort of more organic looking type of clothing, but it's really all fantasy anyway. There's no there's no rules. I wonder what would look like if he painted a whole if you made a whole painting kind of in that style. Of the way that I'm painting the sweater. I wonder could maybe get a little bit more of an impressionism type of look. The painting. Lots of tiny brush strokes. It's a little bit time, consuming, but Also relaxing if you don't mind just kind of getting into zone. How did you learn to draw versa? Is kind of a combination of things I? I started drawing as a kid and I. I just always kept drawing from Ben to now, but in between there was a lot of things that happened, I. I went to school for art at Florida State in Tallahassee. It's not an art school. But I did I studied art in studio art studio or an art history, there, so I did get a little bit of a traditional background an my focus was drawing. And I didn't do any painting or any digital painting while I was in school. It was all like drawing and art art history, focus so Post College. I ended up doing a lot of learning on line to kind of further my art education and that's when I got into digital and I followed a lot of tutorials on Patris on like artists. I was following on Patris on Gumroad YouTube. All that kind of stuff is. So I learned I learned a lot from there and. That's when I kind of got into digital so I have a little bit of like combination background of studying are in school, but also studying a lot from Internet. But I I used to mow it first got me into drawing was watching shows like Sailor Moon. And things like that when I was a kid and wanting to draw the characters from that. That's what first got me into it and that's how I. Kind of got more passionate about what making wanting to make my drawings look nice when I was in middle school and high school. Drawing from photos and things like that. So. All that time was kind of just. Just winging it, I didn't really have any. Particular. Education at that point until until I got to school. How did you go from Florida to the Netherlands? Yeah, OK so I actually met my boyfriend on line through Twitch actually? So you never know what's going to happen in life so that was that was unexpected, but anyway, yes, so I met my boyfriend on line and we were in a long distance relationship. After that, and then I decided to move to the Netherlands. And it's been a really good experience so far. I've been here about a year and a half. Really happy here, I've gotten to see a lot of new things and it's giving me a lot of inspiration in my art, especially with the landscape painting so. Yeah, that's that's how that happened. Oh my gosh, yes, Emily my sister sent about to me, she sent it to me on Instagram apparently there's a? And a Sailor Moon makeup palette out now in case anybody needed to know about that. Breaking news. It looks very cute. Yeah, I did see that. I was looking at the colors and I was like I don't really. I was like I really want this. But I don't think I'm going to wear these colors, they are pretty bright so. Yeah, but it's cool. Hi projects, The paintings looking great thank you. Very cool. I'm at my fancy online as well. Move from Cali to ansi we've been together 9 years, Oh that's amazing that's really cool. Well, I'm happy for you guys. I feel like I'm a meeting people more and more that have had that experience nowadays. Thanks for sharing watching this inspired me to get an ipad and start drawing. I can't wait to keep learning that's amazing. I'm so happy to hear that. That's super exciting well if there's anyway. Yeah, once you get your iPad. If there's anyway, I can help let me know I've only recently gotten an iPad. I got one for Christmas actually and it's pretty exciting, but I'm not like a pro with it yet. I want to learn more. Mostly, I paint on my PC with on my centriq in photo shop. But I've been messing around a little on the iPad. But anyway, if there's any just general digital painting or art related questions. I can help with you can always send me a message. Actually, Fancy Fancy Sailor Mars. Yeah, my sister her favorite with sailor Venus and wine was sailor, Jupiter when I first started watching the show. And then eventually I became a huge sailor, Saturn fan. I even dressed up as her for Halloween, it was. It was my it was probably like. My coolest that was the coolest diver was when I was sailor, Saturn for Halloween, one year. Let's see same also I was like have 2 pallets. I barely use. I'm just going to stare at the pictures, yeah exactly. Unless you guys are going to start seeing me where some crazy makeup on stream and then you'll know that I just caved and bought the Sailor Moon palette. Just like bright pink eye shadow. Were almost were almost there. With this sweater? On the topic of learning and getting into digital art. Can share a link I don't? No how much here will be applicable. Uhm it kind of depends on the person. Hopefully, you'll find something you like here, but If there's a little bit of traditional a little bit of digital alot, there's there's a lot of tutorials and things there on that page that have helped me over the last 6 years or so that I've been doing digital art and. They are there are some YouTube channels and just various things that I found helpful so I hope you guys will find something useful there. Everyone has different learning styles so. They're kind of just feel free to skip through until you find something that you like but there's a long list. So hopefully there's something it's got some of my favourites. Brush Paxson. All kinds of things. And I like to add to that list. Still, now because I'm always. I still like I like to watch tons of tutorials and process videos and streams and things also. Really, Oh that's cool that's cool. I didn't hear about that. Yeah, their books are really nice. Alright I'm going to add a little bit more. Highlights here. I can't leave this one area just kind of untouched because the Airbrush is super smooth and it it's very. Obvious think. Leave an area totally smooth. OK, so one thing that I want to do now is. I've worked on her for a while we worked on the background before and now I kind of want to look at getting her in the background. More cohesive. So. For example, What I mean by that is a little combination of things it has to do with color has to do with value like I still feel like she just looks like she's standing in front of this background and there's a reason. Part of it has to do with the lack of detail the background is still looking much more blurry we can add more detail there. And another thing has to do with color so will address the colors 1st. Hi a sling more welcome. Welcome welcome. We're working on a portrait. So what I would like to do now is to make a new layer an adjustment layer so I have my layers palette here. I'm going to go down to this half circle icon and select. Let's let's use color balance and. I will create a clipping mask of the color balance balance layer onto the character so that it's only affecting her so any changes. They make are not going to have anything to do with the background. And then I'm going to go through The Shadows Midtones and highlights and just kind of. Shift the Shift these a little bit. Until I feel like she. Belongs in the scene, a little bit more so my prediction was that I was going to want to shift her a little bit Hue shift her a little bit more towards a green because I feel like the background has a lot of Green. There's a lot of green maybe a lot of green bounce light so that actually feels better already. Let's see the before and after. Before after. OK, it's like barely noticeable. Maybe it's in my head let's look at the mid tones. And highlights. Going to go a little bit more like cyan. Yeah. It's a little bit different may have been not much of a change. We can also look at the levels. So I think we need to add more contrast darken. The shadows little bit again. I want this to be clipped on here, so that it's not changing the background. See that it's a big difference. She was looking kind of washed out compared to the background. And if anything, we want the obvious that the opposite would want the background to be like later in less contrast, and her so that she stands out so. Yeah, she is a little bit more. Little bit more contrast now. So for and after. Looking a little dark. 2. OK, I think I like this. I think I like this change. So I'm going to go with it. Yeah. Now, technically didn't have to use adjustment layers for those since I was just going to merge them all but I wanted to be able to turn the visibility on and off and check everything together before committing to it so. OK. Also I'm going to look at the little hair ornament and I think I will desaturate it a little bit. It's just really, really drawing my attention with how yellow it was so we're going to turn that down a little bit. And I'm going to merge it down onto her face. Actually, the immediate regret before I merge it hold on. Let's zoom in this event, There's one thing I should do OK. Before we merge it down this will be very quick. I just going to take the Airbrush and give a little bit of shading underneath 'cause like that's going to make it really look like it's sitting against her skin. Without that, it looks like it's kind of floating there, so there, we go now we can merge it down. So one extra step. OK, so let's save. Write another like checkpoint, OK, so right now. If I was going to merge her with the background. This would be the time when I would consider doing it, but I don't know that I want to do that. I don't know that it's needed, for her to be merged to the background. But I'm going to make a new layer an start painting the. Some more of the leaves. Let me show you guys, the reference up close. So there are you can see this blur effect on the right 'cause. This wall is further away from us, but on the left. These leaves are like pretty in focus. They're closer to her face on the Camera you know focused in there so. One thing that we could do is. Drossart paint some of those leaves a little bit more precisely also I think I can crop in like her compared to the background. I have like way more background going on in my image. I think than the original and I certainly don't feel the need to paint that much more background so let's. Let's zoom in a little bit. And these catch up the little shadow, thank you. Yeah, it makes it's nice because it does make a difference. And if I try to do it later it would be a bit. Well, it would be a lot more work as I'd have to go all carefully around the leaf so. Yeah, I'm glad I realized it before I had to go back in. Paint it later. OK, yeah, that crop is way better. I didn't realize how much that extra background was distracting me OK. Here we go. So now we can take I mean, I I'm not sure how much if it really matters. What brush we're using here, but a brush with hard edge and. We can start painting some individual leave shapes. Hi corban, beautiful work I'd like to know what is the shortcut to flip the image. Thank you first of all and let me show you where that is I messed up explaining this earlier so let me. And they were properly now you go to edit. Keyboard shortcuts. And then application menus. And then you can go to image. Philip canvas horizontal and you need to type in here, something that you would like to be your shortcut because it will not. It's not a default shortcut. So you have to go through those steps to set it up, but it's not it's not too difficult to just go to edit keyboard shortcuts and then shortcuts for application menus. And then scroll all the way down to image and then go flip canvas horizontal control F. And then we should be good to go. I put control F because it's easy to remember like F for flip but you can put anything of course. I am drawing and painting on a have a welcome centriq 22. So I'm using the stylus painting on the screen, and then my left hand. I'm using all the keyboard shortcuts, so I find it easier to pick. Shortcuts that are I can hit with the left hand on the left side of the keyboard. Otherwise, you know it's just very inconvenient. Yeah, you're welcome, no worries. I use that one all the time of course, you can just go to also go to edit or image, adjust flip horizontal wait am I telling the wrong thing image image rotation flip horizontal, yeah, so this one. You can do you can always just go to the menus like this and if you only flip every once in awhile then? That's fine, but If you want to do it, I'll do a lot of flipping then. You can set it as a shortcut. So I'm just going to these very, very kind of messy and vague believe shapes that I have an starting to hopefully make them look more like individual leaves so I'm just putting some hard edges in and maybe we can even draw in some little. Veins in the leaves something like this. So they're kind of like coming out of abstraction a little bit. And you can paint via like regular painting like just paint. The leaf or you can sort of do some negative space painting where you choose. The background color and use that to paint. In around green shapes and define the Leafs more see that also can work with different ways of doing this. Pending on what works for you. Or a little bit of both. I think a little bit of both is a natural more of a natural look. I think it's a little bit tricky to find that perfect. Like fade from. From in focus to the blur effect that we use for the background. So I think sometimes you have to go ahead and pay over that a bit. So you get a little bit more subtle transition. We use like a Gaussian blur at the beginning. To make the background a little bit more. Blurred out. So I'm painting on a layer above her right now, so I'm actually able to paint over the edge of I can paint over her and stuff. I don't know if I want to do that. It's possible. Well, I hope you guys are having a good day. Thank you for hanging out with me. We're not quite done, but we're getting closer. If you guys have any questions or anything, let me know. Definitely want to get a chance to put some more finishing touches on this at the end and so I would consider finishing touches to be like any little areas that have little shine or little rim light or something. There's not too much of that, like rim late. There's not too much of that kind of lighting, but I might like to do some little flyaway hairs just last little things like that. Also, a nice thing to keep note of is. Around the edges of the canvas, especially you know the corners lower areas anything away from the focal point. It's sometimes it's nice to get rid of any like super distracting things there so if there's any really break if we painted anything really bright. Or. Very eye catching. It might be nice to tone that down a little bit. If anybody is just getting here now or recently if you'd like to see this painting from the beginning. We started it from blank canvas at the beginning of stream so you're welcome to check out the replay of this, if you ever want to. It's if you go to my page here on be hands. There's a tab that says videos and any of the past streams are there so you could watch any of them if you're interested in this one will be there after a little bit of processing. Time post stream and then you'll be able to find it later. All right, so if I turn this layer on a Nov. I'm definitely liking. This a lot better with the extra background. Details it stoning the background down a bit. It's darkening it a bit an I feel like it has more dimension. I like these leaves closer to her face being more detail than I want to add more of those. Hi Eric all thank you. I'm glad you like it. Thank you. Thank you, you guys can find the reference image of your curious to see it in the stream description below or on the info tab on Top of the chat. And Yeah, it's from. I believe unsplash. Yeah, it's from a photographer on unsplash that I linked to there. Post of the photos and the description if you want to find them, but it's unsplash is a free to use. Image archive, so I like to look there for references also pixels is a good one. After finding nice images to do studies of and things like that. You guys are always welcome to join in if you want to paint with me. You're welcome to share what you do. We had a very cool, one earlier from Jackson. We do another painting, I don't know how long you've been live already today. Unfortunately, I won't be doing another painting, I've been streaming for about 3, 1/2 hours and I will be working on this one. A little bit more. But I probably won't be starting a new painting. Today. But sometimes we do, sometimes we do more than one painting in a stream in that case. I generally will kind of budget out a little bit less time for each one. So I'm trying to paint around her head a little bit of lighter colors for the leaves when we started this there was a lot of the black shadow around their head. Yeah, this is an art club study. Every 2 weeks my discord community is doing a sort of group study were studying different subjects. This time around, we were working on. Up. Fabric folds and wrinkles and things like that, although let's be honest. I spent a lot of time working on other things in the painting, too, but. The main reason we chose this image was for the fabric texture. Things. But anybody is welcome to join in with that, if you're interested I can put a link to my discord. In the chat and anybody who's watching the replay for this, if you'd like to find a link to my discord you can go to the. You can go to my profile and there's a link in there. My information area. Buy a pro designer thanks for hanging out with us. Have a good day. Alright I want to zoom in and do a little bit more of these. These leaves closer to her and maybe we can even detail one of the Brown ones more. I mean, just because they're kind of dry doesn't mean they don't have any detail. We can give a little detail. Seems like the adding a little bit of the veins in the leave goes along way. A little bit of like glimmer. You can even sketch some of that in up here. In these. I think that's an OK transition. OK, yeah, I think I like that, so were to make a new layer on Top of this and I'm just going to work on edges between her and the background. So. An final little finishing things so this is something Mills asked about earlier. Um was about these little kind of flyaway fuzzy things in the sweater. There's like these little tiny fuzzy's and the. The sweater texture that I ended up going with is a bit different. So I don't know if the fuzzies really make sense for me to add but I've certainly seen fuzzy sweaters with sequins on at the same time, so I think it is possible so I can try it, I can try adding the fuzzy texture to the edges and see if it if it works, or if it feels weird then. We'll take it of.- But it's basically just these little tiny, squiggly hairs that are catching some light and it's really apparent more in the high contrast areas like where the sweaters overlapping the background. Then you'll see you'll probably see it. What do you guys think about it just like a first impression? I'm going to keep going a little bit more 'cause sometimes. It's hard to make a judgment on a small area. I think I like it, but I'm not sure. You guys can let me know if you have a strong opinion on this sweater fuzzies. I'm doing it on a separate layer so we can always bail. Can you illustrate an image that does not belong to you and is not hosted on a free site like unsplash? Well, it's a bit of a complicated issue and I feel like I don't feel really authorized to answer without being a lawyer because it's a bit complicated. Technically, you just have to be really careful doing that people have different art styles and sometimes someone references an image but there painting becomes so different from the original that you sometimes can't even tell what they were originally basing it off of and in that case. Then it's less of a problem, but if you're going to recreate something and paint. It very realistically very, very much like the original than that can be. Yeah, that could be potentially a problem. If you're going to try to sell something with your sort of copy. You know what I mean, if you're just doing it for like practice and stuff like that, then that's generally not an issue. It's nice to give credit to the original person that you were the photographer what not but. It's more of an issue when you're selling things. It does fit OK, so you're OK with the fuzzies I kinda like them. I kinda like them. I'm going to keep doing it. But I like to use Pexels Unsplash Pixabay. There are just so many good royalty, free image sites out there. Nowadays, I mean, it's it's. You don't really need to. Go into a risky area you know. Because there's so much out there. There's really, really a lot of content you can use that's safe so. I would I would try to stick with that, if you can just have a? Less headache. Oh, thank you. Karen thank you. Thank you, yeah, tanager. Exactly exactly it just gets a little more complicated. Love the texture yay OK. Thank you I'm glad. Also wondering if it was a little too much. Glad you like it. So I'm not going to put the texture everywhere. But just more in the focal areas and let's work, a little bit more on the hair. I will probably leave the hair fairly smooth just because I think. I think it looks nice. I'm pretty happy with how the hair looks anyway. But we can add a little bit more highlights or just a little bit more. You know, some little more individual strands. Sometimes it's nice to like purposely add Little Flyaways and things that kind of go away from the overall. Motion of the hair might seem counter intuitive but it can make the hair look. A lot more natural if you have some random little flyaways and things rather than all the hairs perfectly going in the same direction because as much as we would like that to be the case. It's usually not happening that way usually there's random hairs flying around. So. I like this area of the hair how kind of curls under. It's got a little bit less one color. Kind of curls and tucks under itself a little bit there. You can also use a darker strands. The background here is a little bit lighter, so we can take some of the darker strands and bring that front of the background. And. Perfect down here, the background little darker, so we can bring some of this lighter strands in front. The darker background. And that's how you can get some more like look of like loose hairs and things. We take a pain like that, it can only do architectural drawings well. First of all thank you for the compliment, Getty on, but I don't think I would say you only do architectural drawings that's a? There's something quite complicated to do. I think that's pretty impressive. Yeah, I bet with the skills that you have doing architectural drawings. That's probably a really, really good starting point for drawing and painting any subject if you have. That kind of patience, especially I think you can do it if you want to get into painting a little bit more for fun. You should you should try. So for me, I started with traditional art, drawing and then I got into painting about 6 years ago, I got into digital art before that. I did traditional but I did specifically drawing so I didn't do any painting with color or used. All lines instead of instead of shapes so it was a really big adjustment for me at first getting into painting because that was a big difference. You know what I mean, it was definitely a big difference seeing things in shapes rather than outlines and it took me quite a while getting used to that. But my point is you can definitely shift that mindset or like sort of. Add to your Add something to your repertoire, you can totally do it. It's not like you're stuck you're stuck with that. One thing you can definitely expand it. Yeah, her hair over here is looking very, very smooth. I guess that's OK part of me wants to like bring some other textures and her hair, but I think if I zoom out and look at the overall image. It's probably for the best to keep her hair smooth. We've got a different texture going for the fabric for the background for the hair and skin so. Probably all right, the way it is. Oh, we never I never went back and did. A lot more work on the hands. Well, I guess they don't maybe need a lot more work, but I do want to add. I do want to add a fingernail at least to her one finger that we see against the face so let's do that. Did you do? Very important. Oops wrong layer. OK, so now we've got an outline of the fingernail. We don't have to get very detailed with this. It's for the best that we don't get very detailed with it because it's not really something we want to draw a lot of attention. But it's just the this looks a little odd if there's no fingernail. Yeah. So we can maybe give a little bit of a pink shade to the to the nail. I kind of would like to keep it. In a natural kind of color. I don't necessarily need it took like there's nail Polish or anything, but just you have a natural little bit of a huge shift there. And we can add a little bit of a shine or something like that. OK, I think that's enough. It's not something that I want to attract a ton of attention. Oh, thank you so much Karen. I'm really happy that it still full. That's awesome to hear if you if you ever have any questions or or anything, you're welcome to ask also. But well while I was zoomed in I think I think I will clean up some last little things on the. The hand here just maybe give little detail in between the fingers a tiny bit and. Just a little bit. Can always lower the opacity? Do make it a little bit softer? But we've got some hard edges because I originally painted this with the lasso tool. Up. Airbrush kind of combo. Just taking a moment to think about what else I might like to do. Make a new layer and grab the Airbrush. Um. Can add a little bit? More highlights to her skin and a little bit more of a pink Hue. Just get a little bit more depth to her to her skin. Funny I'm saying depth when I'm adding highlights but I think you know what I mean, a little bit more richness. You know a little bit more. Variety to the colors. So after I've been working on a painting for awhile. I've had this with a couple of streams. I'll tend to. Kind of put the painting aside and just return to it like the next day or in a few hours and just take one last look 'cause sometimes. I'll finish stream and I'll think I'm pretty happy with it, but later after taking a break and looking at it again. I'll find something that's standing out to me that I didn't really notice before so I think it's always nice if you don't have a deadline like uh if you don't have an immediate deadline, where you have to send something off to a client or or post it by a certain day. It's nice to give yourself a little bit of time to. To like take a fresh look at your image. Later. So I might do this do that with this one and maybe come back later and find that I want to. Fix something. Oh, thank you. Mills did I did I totally pass that. They totally passed that link. Wow, this is amazing. Guys check this out live avenged painted with bows. What a cool style I am loving your last couple black portraits that you painted with us? Really really cool. The backgrounds awesome. Yeah, it's cool to see how you stylize this. Isn't that pretty? Really nice texture to the hair. Nice job with the wrinkles and sweater details really cool. Oh yeah, I forgot about those extra leaves on the shoulder. I totally forgot about that. Well done well done livange. Thank you for sharing link with me Mills. Ah. That's amazing. Are you? I hope you're enjoying your paintings lately? I hope you're proud of them 'cause you should be? Hi there, MD on sale a high everyone. Welcome I'm just kind of finishing up a portrait painting here. Let me zoom out so you can see this is my reference here on the Top left, you can find a link to that, if you're interested below the stream in the description. So you guys, I'm going to try adding some last little highlights here compared to the reference my image is. A little bit less bright in the face so I'm going to come back in and add like one last. Pass of highlights like on the tip of the nose areas that are really getting hit by a bright light and there's a little bit of Sheen to her skin and there's a couple of places like this like above kind of above the eyebrow what I'm doing is I'm painting it in pretty boldly with a brush and then I'm going to use a smudge brush. To kind of? Blurry into her skin a little bit so it's going to appear really intense. At first, but then we're going to like tone, it down so don't worry. Don't worry. It's going to be. It's going to be OK. So painted in. Smudge it out if you go too much with these kind of highlights it ends up looking like. The person is a you know they just just got out of the shower or something there. It'll make them look wet or greasy or something. So we just want a little bit of like natural Sheen to the skin in a way that will feel. Nice usually I'll paint it. On one layer and then decide if we want to lower the opacity or something like that will decide if it's too much. Kind of feeling between they just draw that uh Oh. I see what I can prove. But overall, I'm happy that's a very good place to be and I think. That's a good spot to be in. It's always good to look for things to improve and be be aware of that. But at the same time, he definitely it's I think it's a It's always nice if you can at least find something in your painting that you like. You know. That helps keep. Keep things encouraging I think like for me. You know, I don't like all the paintings that I do of course, and I think everyone can relate. You like some you'll be happy with something and maybe not so much something else. Not every painting is going to go well. But if you can at least find something in there that you're like OK. I like how painted this one area that was cool. I learned something. And then move on to the next thing. I'll try to think next time, but I will promise it won't change to a building or something. That sounds that sounds like a deal. If you have been warned. Ah, thank you live in. A little bit of Sheen to the skin on the fingers or we're almost done. Like for this one, I could sit here and nitpick a little bit more. My painting, but I think it's OK to just say. I learned something I'm happy with something so not everything is OK and then put we learned into the next painting. What I'd like to improve from for the next one from this one is maybe maybe this skin? Maybe the skin could improve a little bit more. But. Anyway I think we're about done. I hope you guys like it. Um. I will probably like I said earlier. I'll probably take another look at this after taking a little break from working on it, and maybe I'll clean up some little things here, there if I see anything. I want to change, but I think this one is finished. I'm going to share in the chat a link to my Instagram so I post. My work here on behalf. Of course, but I generally like to post my favorite things or my more you know more of my like portfolio pieces here so. I'm a us some of the things that I paint on stream. I'll post here and some of them. I will probably just share on my Instagram or something like that, so if you really want to see the paintings. The finished ones posted somewhere you can check both places. But yeah, so this one will appear in one of those places when I decide how much I. How much I like it later but? I really enjoyed the stream. I'm so happy that a couple of you guys painted along. I love seeing what you did. You guys are welcome anyone who's listening in your welcome to join in next time if you like I am here every Wednesday and we do this and I share my references if you want to join in you can no pressure but? Thank you Jackson if anybody else was painting along and you want to share please. Go ahead and just let me know that way. I will make sure to wait for you, if you're busy right now with with uploading the image. I'll give you a little bit of time to do that. But we are reaching we're reaching the end, some last little finishing details and things I can show you in the mean time I don't think it's needed, so much on this one because I kind of addressed this earlier on. But one thing I do. Sometimes is make a new layer on Top of my painting and put it on multiply mode and I'll choose a color. Let's choose like a Brown and make a little bit of like a vignette around the outside. I try to be a little bit sparing with this because it can be very obvious and it can be a bit over. It can be too much. But just a little bit like I put it now at 20% just a little bit. You don't really notice and it. Let's you it kind of draws your eye in over from the edges in towards the center. Thank you a sling more. Thank you so much and thank you. Karen I appreciate it. Yes, there will be a recording Kevin after the stream ends. It takes a little bit of time to process the video, but later today if you. Check back on my page here on Behance. There's a videos tab and this will be there and all my past streams are there too. If you wanted to check those out and yeah. I'm sorry it's the end, but hopefully will see you next time if it's a good time for you, I'll be back next week. I started to dream about. About 4 hours. Ago now so I was trying to think of the easiest way to explain that I'm in C ET time. So yeah, but 12:30 my time, 4 hours ago and I'll be here again next week. Let's see what Lee art was up to. In it check out your painting woo, she looks so pretty. This is very cool. I really would like her face you always have a really good sense of the planes of the face. And proportions. Yeah, it's very solid, that's beautiful. Oh, thank you get him. Hi anchor, Hi Everybody. Thank you. Lee art that was quick also you kind of joined us, the nearer to the end, there, nicely done. So. Yeah, I think that's everything and less you guys, yeah, if anybody else, wanted to share your art.", "duration": 9555.769999999988, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url":

Let's start the tool capture so if you guys are watching this video later you'll be able to see. What tools I'm using Hey Jackson? Welcome so that's the plan for today. As far as like the artwork inspirations that I'm going to be looking at. And I chose a couple of references actually I'm hoping today to maybe do more than one painting usually. On these streams here on Behance what I do is I work on one painting for the entire T of the stream. And get into more detail. I'm so sorry about that. Yeah, so I live in the Netherlands and people like crazy here bout. Fireworks and basically for like 2 months leading up to New Year's Eve, you get. Explosions and stuff going on like randomly. It really freaks me out sometimes but it's just fireworks. I'm sorry about that. Oh, OK anyway. So now everyone is awake. OK, so let's get started with the painting. This is the first reference image that I want to use if you want to paint with me, you're welcome to take it. It's It's under the info panels or below the description. So I'm going to put this image on my other monitor. An Macon you canvas to paint on. Oh boy. Image image size, OK, so I won't make this about 2000 pixels wide. I don't want to make a really big. Canvas because I want to. I don't want to get super detailed you know, I want these to be loose. I want them to be sketches. More than detailed paintings and I know that's going to be hard for me to not get sucked in. Programs do my best and so another thing related to that. I want to try working on these for a little bit shorter periods of time. So instead of working on one painting for the whole stream. I think maybe an hour to an hour and a half for a painting would be like the maximum that I want to spend. I want to keep them loose. I want to big textures. I don't want to get into a little detail stuff, so that's my goal for today. Alright so let me say this. This is in Japan. The reference. And I will also put a little thumbnail of the reference using pure ref up here so let's see. Grab that really quick. So you can see the thumbnail view. All right. Well, it's not very big, but get this idea. Sorry guys I just need to rearrange all my references here, so I can still see the chat Alright How Is Everybody? By the way I hope you all are doing good. Hope you're having a good day, so far I'm excited about this. You know that feeling when you see a painting and then you like want to paint. That's how I felt after. Seeing some of those paintings that I showed you earlier today. Hi Angie, welcome thanks for coming over. Hi Mohammed, you're doing OK. Are you planning to use some John Park brushes or your set that would actually be smart to use his brushes but I'm going to stick with my set. Yeah, and try to familiarize myself a little bit more with it because there's a. There's a few. Brushes that I just added to it that I haven't really used a lot yet and I really like them. So yeah, I'm going to stick with my set. Nice day, but not productive as of yet well. That's good, I'm glad it's a nice day, so far. Same here really well, yeah, we're going to get started now. Yeah, I'm doing good, I'm doing good. Let me take a look at what time it is I want to keep that in mind, so I don't? Spend too long on this one for me, it's 12:45 so I'm going to keep an eye on the time and try to. Keep this to about an hour and then we'll assess how much more time it might be needed. Oh, cool my Sanji will thanks for coming over. So yeah, I'm going to talk through my process as I paint this and if you have any questions, you can let me know and. I hope maybe some of Europeans, along so if you do. And I hope you have fun and you can share what you do in the chat if you would like. Hi son, So I'm going to start with a. Like a Peach colored underpainting using a brush with color dynamics on. I just want to. I just want to start with something in the background. I know this looks a little crazy, but Sometimes it's fun to paint over something like this rather than the white canvas so that if you have a situation where you see through to the background. Colour it's something just has a little bit more going on so a little bit of an underpainting. And maybe I can use it to plan out the value structure slightly so there's some mountains back here. Yeah, so my idea here is I just really want it to feel more like a traditional P thing. So I think it will be fun, I hope so. Then we have this pathway coming towards us a bit more shadows here. It really helps to stay zoomed out if you want to do this type of work like if you want to stay. Boo sketchy focus on the big picture stuff, yeah, it's best to stay zoomed out so you don't get. That sucked into little details and things. I really like this little stream of light over here on the right most those glasses. Really, pretty. OK. I don't usually paint scenes looking into the light. This is kind of a rare one for me. The fact that we see the sun coming through the? The trees over there. I'm interested to see how this going how it's going to go. So I'm going to make a new layer that under painting is done, I didn't make a sketch this time. I don't need that extra layer. Yeah, no sketch know sketch. I think maybe maybe that will help me somehow focus on shapes more. We'll see. So this is where I might experiment a little bit as I was saying, I recently. Downloaded some new brushes that have. Some cool textures to them and things. So I'm going to try experimenting with them and see how how I can integrate them into my brush set. So for the background. What happens if I turn off transfer might make this brush a little bit more intense? I want a blue Sky and ice blue Sky as you see in the reference but I'd like for it to. Maybe show through a little bit to the underpainting if we zoom in maybe you can see, there is still a little bit of texture there. Not a lot, though turn transfer back on little bit more show through. Sometimes you can also use this to either the same brush or a different brush with texture. You can use a textured brush as an eraser. As well and in this case you know, I can erase back in to the Sky if I want little flex. To show through against the other. Underpainting. High enough you're welcome. Now, if anybody just joining in wants to sketch or paint along you're welcome to. The references. Um are available for you on the info panel or in the stream description. You're also welcome to just hang out and relax. OK, so I want to give a little bit of a gradient because generally I notice in painting landscapes that. The Sky. In the Top and often in the center. Of an image is going to be a little bit. Darker gradients and then as you get lower towards the horizon line. You'll get more of a scion color or a bright color. So a little bit, it's just nicer than a flat blue I think. OK so I might try to leave the. This separate from the underpainting I'm not sure but let's make a new layer. And start with the foliage. In the background. So. Let's try that same brush that I was using for the initial block in. Thank you. Thank you son, Hi Tommy's. Metal studs for the texture brush on without transfer would lowering the flow let more show through to the underpainting. Or is transferred just easier to work with that's a good that's a good idea, yeah, I don't mess with flow a lot. Personally, I find transfer easier to work with just because the pressure sensitivity of the tablet will kind of work with transfer for you without making a lot of extra clicks. Whereas for flow you have to come up here and adjust it manually. But some people love it. Some people love messing with the flow and it does help with getting traditional style textures, so that's a. That's a good idea for anybody who wants to play with that, it might be worth it effort might be worth it. For speed I kind of speak to. Using Opacity, Hi Ebros, welcome Oh, we just started don't worry you're not very late. We just began so all I did was. I laid in the background sort of underpainting and we started with the Sky and now we're going to paint. We're going to begin with the background, so one thing that's really pretty about this scene. I think is the. The atmospheric perspective. If you look at the reference you can see how these more distant. Um. Foliage a mountain areas they have. Like sort of a hint of more blue to them because of the distance and the atmosphere, it just. Fades away and it helps sell the whole idea that it's further back. So. And try to. Settle on a sheep back here, but Basically, we just want more little bit more blue. And. We still have some green, especially facing towards like the sun. You can see right here on the reference. So some of these forests facing towards the sun is going to still have some green. And I'm not going to focus on details at all in this stage and really again. I'm trying to focus on the big. Picture thought this whole painting, so I don't know how detailed we will be getting but the background isn't going to be very detailed. Area anyway. Thanks, I think this is a good I think this one is a good challenge definitely does for me. Trying to keep this a little bit more textured and painterly. So over here on the left just going to block in. I'm using a brush called rectangle texture in my brushes and I turned on color dynamics. So that's why with each brush stroke. It's creating this striped kind of texture, but it's really fun. And it's kind of nice 'cause. It sort of does some work for you at the beginning stages. Um blocking in a lot of different. Shades. And then you can paint on Top. But create some happy accidents, which is nice because. When it comes to digital painting. Versus traditional I feel like in a lot of ways, you have more control in digital so. Sometimes you need to purposely create opportunities for happy accidents otherwise. Uhm yeah, things don't have sometimes they can have less of a natural look, but there's a lot of tools like? Color dynamics, you can go to shape dynamics and mess with like size jitter or angle jitter of your brushes. And that will sometimes give more randomized feeling to it, and yeah, those are some things that are fun to play with. Have you gotten a bit more comfortable with the mixer brush to try it on one of the shorter studies today? To be honest, I haven't worked with the mixer brush at all since the last time that we talked about it, so I wouldn't say that I've. Gotten any more practice, but I do think it would work well mixer brush would work well with what I'm trying to do with these today so. I'm just going to see how things going to first begin with regular brushes and get everything blocked in. I see any good opportunities to use the mixer brush then I will but not. Um. I don't have a set plan one way or the other. I'm just going to do what feels right for the paintings. Hi Marcel Good morning. Good to see you. Hope you're doing good. Right so I'm going to. Luck in this whole darker well, it's at Medium Green Medium Green in the middle. And then I really am coloring I'm covering all the underpainting at this point. One thing that I find kind of difficult and I've been trying to work on is the idea of. Getting a painterly look to something but still having strong shapes, sometimes when you think of painterly you think of like. Loose textures and things being a little less precise. And I guess the artist that really inspired me the most and the work that I really love when I. When I think of this type of Art. That I'm trying to achieve is as other artists that managed to make something look loosen painterly but still managed to have strong? Readable shapes in the artwork I think that's such a. Interesting combination. Because they seem somewhat contradictory, but But they don't have to be so that's what I'm trying to practice with is. Strong shapes, but a natural painting type of look to them. Been sitting a lot lately, so I missed some of your streams. All I hope your hope your studies have been going well. And no worries. I'm always happy for you to be here when you can, but I understand is busy. Found out Picasso was a horrible person wow to be honest well. That's sad to hear but I don't know anything about his. My personal personal life or anything like that. Only really know of his artwork. That's odd. OK, well. There's are beginning of a background. I think at this point what I'll do is merge everything except the underpainting so here's what we have now we have this layer. And this one a nice thing about not merging this down yet is I can still use a brush to erase out. And maybe that's too harsh of a brush does this have. What brush do I want yeah something like this? I can still erased out. A little bit through to the underpainting if there's areas for example, where maybe. You see through the grass is to the dirt or something like that, and we have some of these warmer colors. It's up here, maybe I'm. Just experimenting with this, but it gives a little bit more of a traditional painting look so we can erase through to underpainting little bit. Let's just see how it goes will keep going. Alright so I'm going to make a new layer and. Go to the next. Next step and I think that might be blocking in the road as it comes towards us. It might be more interesting to put an angle or something in it. Like maybe a little curve, it seems to be pretty straight. But just compositionally. I think you know meandering paths are a little bit more. Give a little bit more of like a nice relaxing feeling I think versus the. Straight path with so much perspective. But. Anytime you go off from the reference there's a. Room for her so. Maybe something like this. You agree about the path. OK. Yeah, I think that feels. Feels OK. So this is on its own layer, which is nice because you can go up here and press the checkerboard icon to lock the transparency. And then we can paint within that layer easily so for example. If I want to add any textures to the side here. Little any shadows or anything or if I want to add. Highlights because there's some a little bit of dappled lighting very lately. Some light coming through the trees and creating a. Little burst of light on the path here. I don't think it needs to be wider on the Top personally. I mean, it's OK if you think so. I like the dramatic perspective, the smaller the smaller it is. At the Top the more it looks like it's going into the distance, so for me, it's OK. For me, it's OK. I wanted to really feel like it's getting very far away. Switch to a different brush something a little bit less. With the dramatic. Color dynamics. Let's flip this. Oh yeah, Marcel you should also be able to find the reference link below the screen stream description or on the info panel above the. The chat. You can check it out. As much as I love dappled, lighting, I sometimes get very I find it tricky to paint it. I found the pastel soft fluffy brush in my brush set sometimes works well. Let's see real key I hope I'm saying Your name right. It would be interesting to experiment with the road being a stream instead of a road would give you interesting space to play with reflections. Yeah, that could be pretty. Hum. How much time do we have? We do have a good amount of time left, I could I could try it. I'm going to make a new layer create a clipping mask. Um the problem the problem really is just without reference something like that is a little bit hard for me to. Maybe wing it on, I'm trying to imagine what would water look like in this scene in this area, you know. Lighting. I imagine it would have really bright highlights in the place where the Where the light is hitting? Also doing that made me realize my road is way too. Bright 'cause the darker one looked better. Um. Oh yeah, I think you Mills. So yeah, you were thinking of making it a stream, yeah, I'd like to see what you guys do. I think for me, I'm going to leave it as is because without reference. I'm really not sure how the reflections and things would work. And since the goal for me with these studies is working on. Textures uh an traditional look. I think it's easiest for me to stay focused on my goals with the texture to not complicate the. The reference thing, too much for myself. So I'm going to keep it as is. Um. All right. So that means that I don't really like what I did with the. The dappled lighting. Let's try it one more time. Wow, that color dynamics. Went crazy that I change something about it. There we go. I'm going to use the? Lasso tool to make us a selection. It's important for the light to also have. Perspective. Also, maybe I can try like overlay or something like that. Hi Joe, Welcome. Alright, well, I like that better, even though I still think. Kind of tough getting my lighting. Yeah, that feels a little bit better to me. So one thing that I really like in the references this transition. Over here on the right. Between. The bright bright lighting. And. The shadow. And we get some interesting colors right there in that transition. Um. Some green. And blue. Thank you thanks for asking. I just want to say for anyone joining the stream if you're new. I like to do these kind of studies live and do group studies and things I think it's. Fun way to study if you want to join in and share anything that you that you paint. You're welcome to you. When you finish your study you can just share it in the chat if you like. Isn't that blue so pretty it makes me happy? There's another transition back here. Like a medium. Light green and then in the middle is going to be the latest part. So inside of that. There's another layer. Of brush and grasses and things and I like to paint it dark to light in these specific situations. Let me show. I've just found from painting a lot of foliage. If you have a situation like this, where there's a lot of busy stuff going on and you do see through to these dark shadows here. It's and then you have like lighter foliage in front of it, it's a little bit easier to. Find whatever color is like the darker color behind there. Do that 1st and then paint. The. The lighter details on Top. I just found that your brain will fill in a lot of stuff for you. Um. So. For example, Now I can go and choose a lighter green and. Do things like this. And it makes the illusion of like just a few leaves. Coming out of the shadow versus. Having to draw shadows in between all those leaves I think is a lot more tedious. Thanks Brandon I'm working on that for these trying to be. Trying to be more you know loosen. Focus on the big picture thing and it's funny how that really helps with speed. I think a lot of times. Out with with my with some of my paintings. I like overthink things and I spend a lot of time on them and I find that when I do quick studies. You know it. I mean, not every day, sometimes sometimes you have one of those days where things don't go super smooth, but If things are going well, I generally find that these quick studies get can get a lot a cross. Even compared to my work that I do spend more time on sometimes I wonder like is it worth the extra time. I like the freshness of working quick. Did you like my picture yesterday? First time, making a vector art using photo shop, Oh that's so nice? Yeah, thank you. That was very nice of you to share this cool that your. Yeah, so you were using vectors in photo shop do you also use illustrator for something like that? Hi Mister Lee. Thank you for hanging out. Welcome everybody. Looking super cool. I think I'll try these shorter study without using textures. I realized I tend to rely on textures, waiting much. Really that's interesting to hear Jackson I mean, I like how you use texture. I'm always impressed. Especially how you work, it in with the line tool painting. So yeah, I'm interested to see. What you're going to do? Welcome good evening, hi there. I like this so I notice something I don't know how true this is, but to my eye when I'm looking at this scene. Let me color pic from back here this in the background. This color reminds me of some of these Purples that I see here. It's not really that close. But. Just wanted to point that out, I'm noticing for example, I might be able to color pick up here. Choose a little bit more of a textured brush. An kind of dot in some of those Purples. Preferred. Yeah, it seemed clear to the dirt it kind of the dirt in the pathway kind of have. These little. Blue purple hues, though. Tried to make vectors in AI, but it's difficult still practicing nice, yeah, I don't have a lot of experience. With illustrator myself. But there's a there's a lot of advantages to working with vectors. For me the type of painting that I do it's not usually it doesn't usually make sense because I usually do. Raster painting, I do a lot of painting with blending and things like that. I don't make art that's quite clean enough to really benefit from. From Vector, but I think I need to work on this area up here. Doesn't quite make sense yet? I am I haven't quite gotten the look. It feels no, the mountain felt almost see through. I want a little bit more of a solid feeling here. Did you frame the log painting you? Did with the mushrooms? I did not frame, it 'cause I'm actually planning to? To sell that painting so I'm just storing it safely. Pretty cool color combination high referee thank you. I love these colors. It's one of my favorite things. Is uh? The different different colors of greens different hues of Green's you know. Little bit of blue green and yellow green some purple shadows. This painting is like all my favorite things groups and I accidentally. Move this layer there, we go. All my favorite things in one in one place. I think I'm going to merge the pathway. On to the Layer below. So we have. This we have the underpainting and then everything else. Yeah, thank you. I don't know what I do, I drag the layer. It's still not quite back move it up a little bit. There we go. High honor. Welcome. I hope you all are having a good day, so far, you're welcome to join me in the painting if you want. You can get the reference. Below the stream or In the info panel. Minimal colors with maximum shade combinations. I love it. I love it. I've been trying to push myself into other. What's the word like motifs or color combinations color palettes, but this is just my favorite so I have a hard time. Really going away from it. I'm working on a series with my traditional art right now that's sort of Autumn themed an I'm trying to get myself to use. Warmer color palettes and. I think it's helping me learn but honestly I miss the greens. I would paint this, I would stick with this. Every time. But I'm trying to push myself. Or so says have you thought of painting a landscape on one of those big campus maybe someday but? It's just hard for me to work on that scale right now because it's. It's expensive an its and then once I do, make the painting it's then expensive to try to sell it. And ship it to someone etc. So it's just the more difficult, maybe someday, though. Thank you owner thank you so much. I really like impressionist art. Yeah, that's right. Ryan I'm using the same brush from yesterday. This is one of my favorite brushes. The it's the. Rectangle texture in my brush set and then I turned color dynamics on. So it's not a default in my in my brush set if you download it. Color dynamics is not on by default on this brush you have to turn it on. Just getting a little bit little bit brighter, green and yellow. Back here you'll agreeing really want that. Highlight to pop. And we better start painting the trees and stuff, too or else I'm going to run out of time. I'm trying to paint this in around maybe an hour or. An hour and 15 minutes, something like that. Just because I want to do other studies, too, so when I go ahead and after this one paint. Something different. OK so we've got a tree. And. I think the Trying to figure out what I want to do for the tree trunk. It looks in the reference like. It's maybe a purple Hue or something like that. But in reality, it's much warmer I guess there's a lot of. Green bounce light, but look at that. Oh, that's awesome. Thank you Mills. Thank you for letting me know. Thank you Ricky sounds good. Are robberies is try to combine different colors and explore combinations. You can learn new combinations tried the same thing pretty good right now. Nice yeah, yeah that is that is definitely a goal for me. We get comfortable with all different kinds of color palettes different kinds of moods and environments. I think as an artist. It's OK and I think it's actually it can be good to have a signature. Style or something that you are known for a really good at so I don't think it's. Wrong to have something that's kind of your thing. But I also want to be able to do a variety of things. So. Trying to mix it up here in there, too. In the distance, the path has a little splash of light, hitting it so I just want to pop that in. Basically. Yeah, all the way up here where the The grass is being lit as well that makes sense. Alright I don't know if I like that. That's better OK now to the tree. I think I would actually I'm having trouble starting the tree so I think what I'm going to do is. Focus on the Top of the tree first kind of get that shape figured out and then bring the. The tree trunk down 'cause I think when you if you're looking at this from far away your notice. The shape of the leaves first that you know this is kind of a summertime seen the leaves are very full. The trees are full of leaves, and very lush looking. So I think it might make sense to just focus on those shapes 1st. That's what's reading and. We can add. The chunks. So I started with a darker green. But I want to go a little bit more saturated and a little bit more yellow. There's a lot of light shining through. These trees So it might be nice. To get that really glowing green. All thanks thank you every. So. I think I'm having trouble seeing what's going on here there's 2 trees close to each other. The leaves are overlapping and it's getting a little bit confusing. I'm going to turn off this layer and try one more time I just didn't like how that was looking a little too messy. Even though the references have a lot of overlap or there's a lot of overlap in the reference. I'm going to try to. Do my own thing a little bit and just make it. I don't know maybe a little bit more. Clearly, maybe will take out one of the trees or change something. Hopefully will make the reference a little bit more or the painting a little bit more readable we can change things from the reference. So let's try so we have another tree here and this one is kind of this type of shape. And it's a little bit more like dense there's not a lot of space to the leaves. He www.brgd thank you. Does this remind you of pastels? I think it does have that I can I can see that I can see that Mills? I think it does have a pastel kind of look? Although I haven't used pastels alot, myself, so I can't say as far as from the creation aspect? What similarities they are but. There are but I do think it kind of has a little similar vibe Aesthetic Wise. OK, so. Let's see for the next tree. Yeah, I'm going to make these little bit smaller. Maybe a little bit further away. I will go to the next Trian. Maybe I will make a selection one thing that I found can be really handy. Is some? Making a selection of the tree shape and maybe some areas that you want there to be. Leaves things like this and then you can take a nice textured brush. An paint within that selection, larger an more loose than you. My otherwise be able to because. You can just scribble anything inside that selection, so it's really fun. Weight paint stylize kind of trees. That being said, I do want to go outside of that shape 'cause I wanted to look a little bit more natural. But it's a nice way to start your shape to make sure there is a strong shape. So this is where the reference is getting confusing this history overlaps. The other one a little bit and so. Is getting a little messy and it's OK for things that overlap especially in nature? You know it looks more natural I think. But for some reason I was getting was getting confused and I was trying to Interpret the reference. Yeah, Luckily we can just resize things that's a nice thing about digital as well. You Bros, it's like. It's easy to especially when stuff alone separate layer, he can just move it around resize it. Duplicate it lots of stuff. I want to experiment with a couple different texture brushes to create this kind of random chaos in the tree. All of my brushes are. Um. All my brushes are available if you want to download them under the info tab so any of the ones I'm using today you can find there. Yeah, Mills. It's a really clever. I think I can't remember who I initially saw doing that, but I know it's a? I know it's like a popular way to do. To get some nice shapes and stylized things. Or just yeah begin? With painting something. Using the lasso tool. So this brush also has the color dynamics on so it's adding a lot of these little textures without me, even having to. Choose every time you know what the new color is going to be, it's really great. So this is now I merge these together and um. I'm going to lock the transparency. And that way I can start adding highlights and it's only going to add them within the tree shape. I'm gonna switch to a little bit of a softer. Dr brush to get some, like a feeling of a glow in the trees. Alright I'm going to. Go back and erase out a little bit from the trees, too, and. I might choose a brush where I actually kind of specifically erase out what I want sometimes you know you guys have seen I like to use texture brushes a lot. But sometimes you just have to go in and kind of do things by hand. Like I don't know exactly if I have any brushes that would erase out exactly what I want. So I'm just going to go and scribble some things maybe a brush like. Yeah, maybe something like this. Could blend those a little bit. But I like having these openings. To see through this to the Sky. OK, well, I think it's time to work on the branches of the tree. Trees so I'm going to do this on another layer. And. Choose a deep Brown maybe towards. Purple I'm honestly, not 100% sure what kind of color. I want to use for this so. I'm just going to start and then we can always Hue shift until it looks right. That's what I do when I'm not having a vision for what the color should be. Also I'm noticing right now that my tree. Doesn't really line up in the same place as the reference does as far as like? The silhouette of the tree in the background highlights so we can just make these a lot bigger. So Luckily pretty easy to do. And yeah, I'm going to right now, I'm only worried about the shape of the branches of the tree that I'm painting, I'm not really worried about the color at all. Because we can. Hue shift and try new things really easily so. Just right now focus on the shape try to make it interesting. There's a lot of branches. Intertwining and overlapping and reaching out trees have beautiful gestures to them. Alright so I think I like the shape OK. And I will go to image adjust Hue saturation and we can just maybe desaturate darken lighten you see it's just until it looks right. So it's really handy also since it's on its own layer. We can lock the layer and I can apply shading and things within that, so there's actually a lot going on if you look at the reference. Zoom in on that tree. Let me show and sorry it's very pixelated at this zoomed in amount, but Oh yeah, we can look at that so the left side of the tree is going to be a little bit warmer. Makes sense through the lights coming from. So we can kind of give a little bit of a gradient. And the right side will be more purple have some purple bounce light. You're probably gonna finish this earlier than you thought that's crazy, that's crazy, I don't know. I'm I'm happy this one is going smoothly that's not always the case. But this one is going together. Quickly. Himera welcome. So I will lock the layer again and maybe add a little bit of texture to the bark. Just a little bit. Thank you Maria. Don't forget the drawing, the white arrows, writer for the add something doesn't it. OK, so I am going to add the highlight like a rim light. Which is? This satisfying part of any painting. So. See the Warm bright rim light on the tree it's pretty sharp highlights. In a couple of places an one area that's almost almost like pure white. There's a really bright spot hitting. Although I have to be careful 'cause. Does it make sense? I know I didn't paint everything in my. Painting exactly where it is in the reference so I just want to make sure that where I'm putting the light. The highlights is actually working and I think it's OK. Yeah, I don't mind if things aren't exactly the way they are in the reference as long as it looks good and it works. I'm focusing more with this study on. You know textures and practicing with stylizing things so it's OK, yeah, if they're not quite the same and everything. Thanks, Ryan. Love the colors and how the background turned out like a JPEG artifacting somehow wielded by artists witchcraft thanks. Yeah, it's so weird thing with the with the colour dynamics with that striping effect sometimes it's. I'm wondering like him and I purposely. Like distorting my painting what am I really doing here, but I think it looks so cool. But there's a lot of artists whose work I really love and they have given me good inspiration and how to? Use color dynamics in a way that. That makes things feel a little bit more traditional and I'm trying. I'm trying to. Trying to bring it into my paintings. Really glad you like it. Thanks, I am in. Welcome. I'm going to lock the layer and. Dark in Some of the shadows on the tree in just a couple of places. And I think we'll be ready to merge this down. I really like to merge layers as soon as I get to a certain point, I'd like to keep them separate so that. It makes a lot of things easier when you're in the painting process. But whenever I finally decided OK I like where this is I want to keep it there. At that place I like to merge so that I can feel like I can paint more freely after it's merged. Get more traditional kind of feeling. So I'm going to try to be brave and merge this. So here we go. So now I just have the underpainting an everything else. Yeah, I'm taking a look at the time so I think we have, maybe like. 1015 more. Minutes. On this one for me. So what can I do to help I think on the left hand side to help us feel nice? Finished. Now there's a few things. All the foliage on the left. Is it's in shadow so it's OK in my opinion for it to be a little bit less detailed it's in shadow an it's not. The focal area That being said it's a bit too, loose at the moment. So I'm going to work on this one tree a little bit more and then I'm going to go over there and. Yeah. Clean things up a little bit. So I'm trying to look at the big shapes that I see in the reference and basically seeing some. Some, like tears Blackwood better explanation of levels of leaves, and Bush is that overlap. And so rather than focusing I want to focus on any individual leaves yet, but I want to get that kind of. Organization, where we can understand the. What's in front? What's behind? Get some form explained with all this massive foliage. Hi Waqas welcome. So there's also a tree that comes out into the light more so it's something like this. And. Yeah, and so we get a little bit of a feeling of the leaves kind of hanging down. A little bit more yellow green to this one. We have a little bit more light shining through. So I will lock that layer because I want to add a little bit more bright yellow green so anywhere that there's an opening to the Sky. And in between these leaf groupings that's a place where I might put a little bit more yellow green. Alright so I'll make a? Yeah, merge those 2 layers. There's also a couple little clouds in the Sky. But they're very, very wispy and barely there an I wonder if. It's a good idea to try to add them, or if I should just kind of forget about it because. They're barely barely there. But we can play with the idea, a little bit. Maybe have some little it just makes the Sky look a little bit more. I don't know alive to have a little bit of something going on there. Some little happy little clouds. And the reference the clouds are pretty overexposed. So you don't get a lot of information. So I have to kind of. Make my own decisions on that. I don't know I don't know. Maybe just the Maybe just a couple little wisps is enough. Going to look up a little more breaks in the tree here into the through the Sky little bit more openings. You like the happy little cloud accents thank you. Let's see. Lee says my blurry attempts OK. Thank you for painting with me. Let's see what he has done here. Cool wow that perspective reads really well. Nicely done Lee this is elizar in the chat. Magenta is really cool. I love it when you add these Purples and Magentas. Very cool colors like these little hints of detail on the grass is. If anybody else, wants to paint or draw along you're welcome, too. I like to see what you're creating. Hebrews says will you make the sun behind the tree? Oh yeah, I kinda forgot about it to be honest. Let's try. Let's try and see how it looks. Maybe I'll not put it in the exact same spot as a reference. But let's see about that, maybe we can add it. Here. I found that when you're doing the traditional style painting. Sometimes those kind of effects don't always look great what I mean, is like lens flares and stuff like that. Sometimes it looks. That stuff looks more digital and it doesn't fit as well, you know any. Traditional looking digital painting. But what I could do is like a really, really bright like this, I can just make the space in between the trees. Really really bright over here. And that might help make it look like the sun is just right behind there. How long are you streaming 40 that's a good question. Let's see I started about an hour ago and I think I'm going to be streaming around 4:00 or so hours today. So I have about 3 hours left most likely but we'll see how it goes. Maybe I can go a little longer, but will be around that time. I think you are mad. Thank you very much. I'm glad you like it. Yeah, I think that really bright spot coming through could be cool and. You know, maybe we'll see emerged a lot of things. But. I can make a new layer and put it on color Dodge or linear Dodge or something like that. Let's try linear Dodge. And put my brush mode on linear Dodge and. Maybe use a soft like a light texture and see about adding a little bit of. Of late here and in the Sky as well. So just to make it more clear that the. There's like this is brightness coming from the left. I think it can work I want to go to. Go too far with it, I'm going to erase back into that a little bit. All right. So. See. Yeah, I think I am almost let's let's finish, wrapping this up. I think I think it could use a little bit more time. I know for a while, there, it looked like it was going to. Finish right around the hour mark working on this, but I think it could use a little bit more time. That would really, really benefit over here on the left side specially so let's keep going. I wanted to feel finished and then we'll go onto. Another one, will do another one of these, and I'd really like to do at least 3 studies today. So that's the that's the plan so there's a lot of chances if anybody wants to join in. One you're welcome to. And you don't have to. Feel like you need to paint it in in one hour or anything like that. Jack thank you so much. Thank you. How do you like it? If you guys are. Interested in seeing some of my art inspirations for for this. I've put a couple of artists names below in my stream. Description those are some of my my influences, I'm trying to learn from. And that would be. John Park and Clement Tingri, I hope I'm saying the name right. I really like, how they use. Digital painting, but with a traditional kind of look and feeling so I'm trying to work on that. Over here, we get some leaf shapes hanging out over the. The shadows. And this is exactly what I was talking about earlier feeling like the. Dark to light is helpful because. We can sort of hint that this kind of thing earlier more easily. OK. So. Look up the morning details of the leaves. Maybe I can try another brush as well. Something that. Maybe will hit that that texture more. I want a little bit more of a subtle transition between the. The grass and all the bushes and things so I'm just going to. Light repeating some texture down here. I'm on the edge of the pathway. Let's make it feel more grounded. We add the darker Bush is on the right in the distance. Oh, I wasn't going to to be honest but. I could try if you think if something's missing. Working on another layer right now, so it doesn't hurt to it. Sketch in back here and see what it looks like. Maybe a little extra. Noisy Ness would be good. Little bit more transition between the detail area in the. The distant. More simplified parts of the landscape. There's another thing I struggled to add which was like a highlight on the mountain up here. I couldn't say what color to make it I can't really tell what color it is in the reference maybe something like this? Looks like it gives more depth. Yeah, I think I like it more too. Wood burner, Dodge be a little more subtle touches and blend smoother. Burn or Dodge. Oh. I guess if you're comfortable using those you could I don't really use them so much now do you mean? Like a layer blending mode or a the burner, Dodge Tools on the toolbar. Asking for your own reference I find. I find that. You for me, I like painting as much as I can on the normal layer because I feel like. I feel like it gives the most natural results. I wouldn't really suggest in landscape painting, although. You know, everyone is different and I'm sure somebody can make it work. I'm sure you could make it work, but I really wouldn't suggest using the? Like the burn tool or Dodge tool here. It might work well for like photo editing and different things. But for painting your kind of better off if you want. Burner Dodge effects going to making a new layer and choosing like a color Dodge or color burn or multiply or overlay. Some of these layer blending modes will have better. Affects for this. Also, you can. You can even turn your brush mode on to some of these effects and that will work nicely too. But that would be my suggestion. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think I think there's a lot of overlap between photo editing and digital painting, but then some. Things are probably better, more for one rather than the other. Right so I think I'm a screencap this and get a full size back then, too late. Oh my God. Thank you. That's like the most surprising in a specific compliment. I'm imagining to get thank you with the. Photoshop window and everything wow that would be the most unique tattoo in existence. Thank you. Hi Marina, so it's been around an hour of painting right now. By the way if anybody missed if you want to see it from the beginning after the stream is over. The video just takes a little time to process and then it will be available on my page under the videos tab. You can watch everything from the beginning. We started from a blank canvas. So if you want to go back and watch that as possible to see. Later, but yeah, it was around an hour or so. Uhm OK, so I think I'm going to merge this down. Make a new layer and the last thing that I want to work on is just this tree in the middle. Not the big one on the right, but this one right here. There's a little bit more interesting things going on in it than what I was able to capture so I want to add a little bit of. Like shadows and highlights basically you can see in between the branches a little bit. There's some bright patches of light coming through. Where the trees like thinner and I think it's really pretty? I think it would be nice. To get some of that. In the painting here. I'm going to paint the background. Through there. Thank you. Thank you. I saved a few. References to use today. I want to do a couple more studies and there's some. Yeah, I'll share the references with you if anybody wants to join in but I find these references through a website called? Map crunch com which I love. I'm like spending way too much time on there. But it's it's a website that basically let's you search through and get random images from Google Street View basically it's Google Street View Images. But you can just click through an it'll give you like random ones or you can search within specific. Country or area. And it's really nice for. Getting painting practice and a lot of different subjects and things because. You know the whole world is possible. Painting. At least anywhere where the Google Maps car has been so there's stuff all over the place. Lots of different. Options so I've been painting, a lot of different places on my streams here. If you want to check out any of the past videos, you can see, there's. Some in the desert some some in more lush environments some in some with buildings. Some all natural ones I really find the. Purely nature seems to be the most relaxing to paint but I do also like painting buildings and. Seems with You know more. Opportunity for storytelling evidence that there's people living somewhere or maybe someone's taking. You know a ride in the country or something I've been trying to work towards including characters or people more in the scenes, too. So that's something I might try to do. Fun to paint along to only had enough time for this painting, but I learned lots that's awesome. That's awesome. Thank you for joining us you guys are welcome to share if your paint along you want to share what you did, I'd love to see. You can post your art in the chat. Thank you Johnny. Thank you. I'm on the last bit here for me, I just want to put a little bit of there's some little plants. Growing here on the right and they have some more warm colors. In the stems. And then some nice bright green leaves larger leaves. I'm not sure exactly what type of plants these are. But I think it looks pretty against the more blue green. Over here and it brings some. Little bit of that. Bright light. Into the foreground I guess. Some dappled lighting. Hi Andrew Man. Thank you. Going to choose a different brush for painting in these details. It's so much closer to us than. Mostly everything else in the painting so I want to. Maybe a little bit more precise how I paint it. So it's basically just little dappled light. Spots of lighting these. Leaves. And we got a nice yellow want to go a little bit more towards Green get a very saturated. Green. And maybe that's too much. But there's some area where the The light shining through these leaves and they get an Icicle Oh, so pretty. That's Hi Carol, how are you? OK, so. I think we're on the finishing touches now last thing I'm going to do is sometimes at this stage. I will. Do some finishing effects with the airbrush I will show you guys what I like to do. Make a new layer above everything else, I have a blank layer, he will get rid of. And. I like to make my airbrush really large and kind of paint a big network effect around the outside. And. Sometimes, all Hue shift that and decide what color I want it to be so for example, you know, do we want? Blue purple. Something warm I think a purple is nice. And I will just. Lower the Opacity 'cause I want it to be barely there, but just darkening the outside a tiny bit. I don't want it to be really be noticeable. But it just kind of directs your eye towards the inside of the picture, a little bit more. Nice work I love thank you. Thank you very much. Some last color effects, we can do, I'm going to make another new layer an try maybe screen mode. Is? Going to get a saturated blue purple. Open paint in a little bit of a glow the Airbrush. In the Over the mountains in the distance and it's too much a lot of times when I paint in these effects. I just go pretty intense with them at the beginning because I like to. Really see what I'm doing see what the effect is and then I'll like lower. The layer opacity until it's the amount that I want. But it helps me to like really see what I'm doing to paint it in pretty heavily when I'm doing these kind of things. And then you know lower, it until it looks good. Thank you thank you. But in the do some artwork I can, relax, the last we going to the beach for straight hours, it was wonderful. That's really nice, yeah, the beach going to the beach going to the forest. Things like that, really good for. For inspiration and Yeah, rebuilding your creative Energi. That's one thing that is a little difficult for me during the winter. Because I don't I don't go out and spend time in nature, quite as much as. In other times of the year and I. I definitely miss it. I need to kind of force myself to go out even though it's cold. It really does it does feel good? Alright so will merge these down, I think the very last thing could be uhm. Last little brightness right on that Patch of grass coming through so make a new layer we can try. Putting the layer on color Dodge mode. I'm also going to throw a black paint bucket on the layer. So it's Yeah, 100% black layer and then on color, Dodge Mode, someone taught me this trick if it's a really cool way of. It just creates a little bit of a different effect with the color, Dodge and makes it a little bit more. Which is a little bit more saturation? I just causes the colors to behave a little bit differently so you can try it and see. If you like it. But we can pop a little glitter here. Again, it's too much. For me. But maybe can lower the opacity after that. Say OK alittle bit of that is good. One thing I probably could have done before getting into all those details is I was thinking about adding some more. Details to the tree. I think if I'm going to critique my own work. That's the area that I could have. I could have done something a little bit more with is this tree. There's a lot of negative space in the Sky. And it would be nice if this tree. Had some more branches projecting out into the Sky. That would kind of activate the. The negative space. So. Maybe I can paint them in by hand. I was kind of looking for a brush. That was going to maybe give me some of those effects. There's branches coming out in lots of different directions. Yeah, so. I can come back. Over some of those. I have not I have not tried that Mills. I have not tried any of the those kind of things with overlay. I don't know I can't tell I can tell if I prefer that. Well, I think it's done, I don't want to get stuck fiddling with things at this point in the painting. Because. Then we won't will get stuck and we won't get a chance to move on and paint something else, which I want to do today? So. I will call this finished. Is this hand drawn? Yes yes if anybody wants to see later the whole process of painting this you're welcome to. Watch the video once it's processed after stream will be uploaded on my channel. The videos tab are on my page here and be hands. So. You can see it if you want. Um. This one was about an hour let's see. An hour and 15 minutes or so. Maybe a little bit longer. OK, so. Let's do another painting. After decide what the next one is going to be. I collected some references for the stream today. So let's see. I want to do something with a little bit of a different. Mood. A lot of the references that I chose involved foliage 'cause. This is one of the things I really want to work on. So. I was thinking something like this. Um has a cool mood. Another landscape something a little bit more cloudy and Moody. This is in Spain. And there's also some cool like little city down here, something but I like these trees and bushes and the textures, another winding path. It's going to be some similarities in the one that we did, but a different mood. So I will add this one. The information for this reference to the description below the stream if you want to. Use it and paint with me. One moment to do that. And I will share a screenshot of it as well. By the way if anybody painted with me for the last painting that I just finished if you want to share your welcome to. You can post it in the chat. If you're a URL to your artwork. OK. So. Let's begin with the Next One I will replace this reference. It's updated OK cool nice that was fast. All right, Jackson might take for this one, I didn't use the textured eraser like the others in the past. Ooh I'm very curious. Oh, wow. What do you think Jackson I think this is awesome? So Jackson Joker in the chat is doing uh. Did a study with us this is using the line tool? Which is really a crazy challenge to do if you've ever tried it? It's yeah it's a difficult challenge. Um. The lighting and everything came out awesome. It's such a happy feeling I love the colors. Yeah, it came out so well, even without any you know eraser textures, like you were talking about. Very cool, I like that. Hey Glenn, Now, thank you. Thank you for sharing your work. Well, it, I don't know if it was how you feel about it after doing it versus the ones with the. Texture eraser it looks it doesn't look you made. It look easy as I'm going to say it doesn't look like you were having a big struggle. I don't know if behind the scenes. You found it difficult to do. Alright so I've been you canvas that I'll be using to paint the next one, an let's put the reference up here. But whoops that's Jackson's painting. OK. Let me try again to get the proper reference here. There we go. And maybe will zoom in a little bit something like this. Be nice. OK. So let's see we're going to make this a little bit bigger maybe. 2500 pixels something like that why'd? And. Yeah, I think this aspect ratio is good. Maybe I'll make it a little bit more. Little bit less wide screen. And this is in Spain. I already did. OK. So if anybody is just joined the stream just to give a quick idea of what I'm doing hello. Everyone my name is Maddie. I'm doing virtual Plein Air Painting Studies. So I'm using images from Google Street View I found them through a website called map crunch com. And we're doing studies based on these environments on painting from these from these references trying to focus today on. Textures and getting a? More traditional look to my digital painting if you want to join in the references in the studies of these references. You're welcome to, you can just grab the reference from below the stream or in the info panel. And. You can use my brushes as well. If you want to try them out there also under the info panel. So I'm going to start the next one and my goal is to spend around. An hour between an hour and an hour and a half on it. Just kind of depends how it goes if we struggle or if it goes smoothly, you never know. How it's going to go so that's my plan? Brian says do you ever take a reference and crank the saturation or contrast so you can see subtle differences? Yeah, sometimes? What helps me most is just turning into black and white. That helps me get an idea of the value structure without the whole color thing confusing things so that helps me. Um. Let's see. Oh, Kara is that a uhm. Is that a photo you took or something that you're trying to request for us to paint? Don't know I prefer this kind of painting or not, but I really need to keep practice with the Untextured Workflow. Yeah, I think it is good practice. It's funny. We're doing like the opposite thing right now. I'm trying to do textures. You're trying to not do textures. Um. OK, well, let's get started with the next painting. So yeah, let's see again. It's about 2 for me. Alright well, if anybody's painting along happy painting. I'm going to explain my workflow. As I go through this. And if you have any questions, you can let me know. So. I'm going to begin again, with an underpainting. So I'm going to choose a warm color or something similar to what I would see on the ground here is being the. The dirt I guess. And I am going to turn on color dynamics again. It's going to be similar similar start as the last painting. Um Alexander How do you use the new mega brush pack it's very cool for such paintings? Uhm I actually haven't used it in awhile. Um. I do agree that call, Websters brushes are awesome. I actually used to buy some of his brush packs before they started including them. With the photo shop subscription so I think it's awesome. Now that they are available. But I don't know I like to make my own brushes and I like to tweak brushes. A lot, so I'll download brush packs and then I'll. Take a brush that exists an I'll change a bunch of the settings and save it as like a new preset. So I end up kind of personalizing my brushes a lot. Yeah, yeah. That's that's right. They are free. Now I think it's great because I used to pay for them separately. And now I don't have to. OK so let's get started. Uhm I think it might be nice to paint the Sky. First usually with the landscape paintings. I like to start with the Sky because it's furthest. So it makes sense going back to front and also it help set the mood for everything. So I'm going to use the same brush as I did for the last painting 'cause I think it. Worked out. Worked out pretty well for the Skysoft Sky. You missed the end. Um did I close my. PST already. Oh, I hope I didn't. Yeah, there, we go that's like I don't remember I don't remember closing that but yeah, here we go. This is this is the end of the last one. OK. Yeah, and really quick if I turn off all these layers. On the last painting this was the underpainting for that one so. I guess actually before I start painting the Sky. I almost forgot a step. This is kind of new to me. Um, I've kind of recently starting to use underpaintings, an experiment with them more. So what might be nice in this scene is to put in a little bit of the value structure. In underpainting too, so instead of justice. A random color. And then we have. A little bit of highlight in the Sky. I really like the Sky in the scene. And I find cloudy days. Hard to get good reference photos of. A lot of since I paint a lot of scenes from map brunch and you know the Google Street View. I notice that a lot of photos of cloudy days have ferry. Um there are either really overexposed or they have a lot of HDR applied and it looks kind of a natural. It's really difficult. I'm not photographer, but it must be really difficult to photograph cloudy skies very effectively because I. I just find that it's hard to hard to find good painting references of cloudy days. But I like this one, I think it's really nice. So just I guess the underpainting if I use it this way. Can become a little bit more of a sketch? You know. Something that's helping me think through where things are going to go. Hey Rafi, Ah, thank you. Hi Allison, So there's Couple. Trees or Bush is here. I'm going to like a shorter wide one taller. One next to it. Happy little trees and brushes. All right. So I think that's OK to start with so now we can go into the Sky Finally. All right so. I will choose a very, very light blue Gray. I'm trying not to color pic from the reference. I'm trying to just look at this. And see what it is so I think a very light blue. Gray color. For the Layer one of the Sky. I'm just going to paint over. The background. And I think. So I think it makes sense to kind of work. Um. Light to dark in this in this situation so we have a light. Background of the Sky and now I can go in and paint. Some of the darker clouds that are starting to create shadows. I'm going to make a selection. Of this cloud shape here and use a brush called soft shading and blending in my brush set. And I really like the Sky to me already even in the reference kind of has a look. Of a painting. I notice that clouds can often get that look just the way that the way that they naturally form. Can often look wispy and like paint strokes? There's a lot of like energean. Movement. Good take the smudge brush and smudge out. Some of these. Details in the Sky and of those hard edges. It's nice to have a little bit of hard edges. That's one thing that I notice painting. Painting clouds is the edge play like having hard and soft edges and where to blend them is really. Really important in making it look like a? Make a real cloud. Is this a draft drawing it is a sketch so it's just for study? Just a quick study. I picked a color with a tiny bit of warmth. To start putting these highlights coming through the clouds. I would guess thank you. Welcome. And then in the area that's Cloudy that's more cloudy there's also going to be areas where the clouds are happily kind of a glow to them. I think it's just take a little bit of back and forth. There was a day recently. Um. Near where I live I live in the Netherlands and there was like we get a lot of cloudy days, especially in autumn. And. There was such a pretty Sky. I didn't. I didn't take a photo of it. I'm not sure what I've come out anyway on my Phone. As it looked in person, but it was a cloudy day was cloudy Sky. But there were so many colors coming through the clouds like was full cloud color cloud cover but the clouds had like. Some of them have had a blue hand. Some of them had like yellow like a Peach color and it was just. A little bit, it wasn't like it didn't look like. Supernatural or anything, but it just made me realize how much. Clouds are not just Gray you know you imagine like Oh, it's a grey cloudy day but there's often times a lot of. Subtle little color shifts in the clouds. Oh, thank you. Thanks Alexander Yeah. See you another time, it would be great if you joined us painting. Yeah, anyone is welcome to join in if you like. I always share the references that I use for painting and if you want to join in doing a study. We can. Paint along an? Share what you do. And it's OK, if you're a beginner, too don't feel don't feel intimidated. Any any skill levels welcome and if you have any questions. You can ask me. If I don't know the answer. Maybe somebody else does. Well, I think that's OK as a start for the Sky. I want to do more, but I don't want to. Start getting too detailed with the Sky when the other areas. The painting are not even blocked in yet so. I'll merged the skies is all in one layer an will get going with the next. Which we will do I think we can start with the? The Hills and then on Top of that will do trees and bushes, and little grass is an all these textures and everything. Hi love how are you? OK, so. I will probably go back to my trusty. Rectangle texture brush and. Pick something that has a little bit more. Yeah, a little bit more towards yellow or desaturated. I like this, this peachy color for the underpainting. But I think for to get the really get the mood of this scene. I want to go a little bit more dull a little bit more muted. With the colors. But it's very it's very. Still see through I think if I turn off the background layer you can see how much the marks that I'm using? Right now, I have a transfer on so. They're not full opacity Ann. We really are seeing through a lot to that background, you know if I was painting with such as the white. Canvas. That's what the painting would look like. So it is making use of the underpainting even though. We're changing the color a little bit more towards something different. All thanks love. I hope so. I'll do my best. I picked up some more a little bit more simple straightforward references today. Not that they're easy because I don't think any paintings really easy. But I think. Yeah, I just wanted to pick stuff that didn't have for example, lots of buildings and cars and. You know really complicated stuff because I wanted to focus more on style and texture, so taking away a little bit of that complication is letting me really relax. An I work on. Style things. I noticed for myself if I really want to study something it's nice to take away some of the other variables that are difficult. So you can really focus on that one thing. So now I'm just starting with some of these different colors. On the Hills. There's all kinds of different plants and foliage and weeds and you know. Kind of stuff. Different colors. Different colors green greens. I love the slightly different colors, slightly different shades of Green. So for example. Little bit darker. Got here. And you can see it's up here in my reference. Bringing this. Later, Green and see that's not quite the right color. Sometimes it takes me. Awhile to find the right color. Without color picking you know gotta try it, see what it looks like. It's not working. Well, is it? Is my version too warm or too cool off with it and then you can adjust the right color? The texture of the brushes, making now looks really crisp, thanks rocky. I think this brushes interesting an really any brush that you use color dynamics on especially if it also has. This brush has dual brush and. Color dynamics, so let me show you something really quick on a separate layer about how it works. So because it has color dynamics on and apply per tip. It's causing this striping effect if I Uncheck. Apply per tip, then, instead of changing the color with every single. Stamp of the brush it's going to change the color every time I make a new brush stroke. Which is really nice also if you're going for like an impressionistic painting look 'cause you can sit here and paint a bunch of colors next to each other. And you don't even have to choose any color every time you can just. You know say how much you want the color to vary from the original color. But anyway because of this. Texture and dual brush. If I'm painting lighter. It really blends the. The striping a little bit and makes it not so dramatic so if I want to press since I'm using transfer. If I want to press harder on my tablet, then you get a nice this striped texture and if I. If I go lightly, it kind of overlaps an creates a less dramatic version of that so. One of my favorite things and this is just kind of. I don't know that this really affect so much in the results of your painting, but just during the process of making a painting. I really like to find things like that that make it nice to use like the workflow is important to me. When I'm painting, I want to enjoy the process of painting and I want it to be. I want to be relaxing and nice and one of the things I like if I find a brush that's. Super versatile or something that I can. Yeah, easily make a bunch of different marks with without going to my brushes and switching to a different brush. I really like that kind of stuff an kind of the same thing with the. Setting up shortcuts and things like that, for yourself. I'm a big fan. I could probably add even more shortcuts than what I use. But. Yeah, I like trying clue. Get a nicer experience painting experience. Through those kind of things I just realized I was painting on the layer there and I think it might be better to keep this. Little pathway separate until we are sure of everything with the perspective so. We'll just do it this way. La path going the distance. We've got on its own layer for now. OK, so. Trying to find the right green for these. Bush is in the distance, we're almost there. Maybe a little bit darker. There's also shadows. So I like the unevenness of these Bush is they do form kinds of a ridgeback there, but it's not it's not perfectly. It's not a perfect stripe, you know, there's a little bit of. Undulation to it. So right now, I'm painting kind of the darker area on these. This foliage back here I will come back in with another. Layer and add some highlights I think, to give it a little bit more dimension. So what would it look like if you would turn up the spacing same result of evenly spaced rates of color. We actually I did that yesterday in a painting. Uhm I had turned the brush. Yeah, the spacing on the brush further apart and it just creates this kind of. Thing so depending on what you're painting, I was painting, a girl with a braid and from a distance. It kind of gave that. Rough appearance and was yeah, it was cool, but it depends. It's a very specific kind of thing that might not work in a lot of situations. But it's fun to mess with that stuff, changing the spacing on the brush can turn the brush into a completely different brush. But that's true is like so many other brush settings, you know. You just change a couple little things and bam just a completely new brush. So this is actually kind of cool, Rafi I'm glad you said that. It can make it more wispy looking too. OK. So. Back to the regular settings. And there's a big. Bush over here. That kind of almost hangs out over the. The pathway. And so I just want to get the overall round shape of it. Blocked in Where the shadows are roughly? And then There's a tree right next to it. Every she needs a friend right. These 2 are great together. I love the variety like the loop that all thinner tree. Short stouter tree. Both pretty rounded shapes so overall pretty cheerful feeling. Yeah, maybe we'll try our little trick here with making a selection of the overall shape of the tree. And. Lightly, dabbing, a textured brush can also erase into the shape and try a different brush. It's just such a fun way to begin a tree. Painting. Can have the? Branches curving inward towards the. Tree trunk. Yeah, my color wheel is Coulouris. It's yeah, it's a separate plugin that that I have. I originally got it because an older version of photo shop didn't have the colour true triangle color wheel, which I. Really prefer now you can actually go to window color. And. You can use this color wheel if you have CC 2019 or later, so. Otherwise, you would have this Hue Q, which a lot of people like but I just prefer the triangle. So that's why I got Coulouris. It does have some other features that are called to it has like gamut, masking and stuff, but I just don't. Use it normally. But yeah, it some. Nice looking I like how it looks so I still use. It even though it's technically not. Not needed anymore. So I'm trying to use a textured eraser and erase back in towards the tree shape to break up that perfect. Edge that we created. With the lasso tool. Maybe this one. Would be a good choice? That's the only problem. It's cool that it creates such an intense shape. But yeah, if you don't want that then. You have to erase back into it and. Make it look a little bit more natural. But it's nice 'cause it does keep you like remotely with the clean shape as like the structure of it. My starting point. I'm going to flip this and flip my reference and take a look. I think this tree. It still turn a little bit. I like the feeling that it's kind of angled inward at least at least not angled outward would be a preference. And before I merge I want to. Get these in the perfect spot. Not quite ready to merge yet. And these 2 are very close together almost. Overlapping also I'm making the trees little bit bigger in my painting than they are in the reference that's OK, I think. Just want to zoom in on them basically make it a little bit more interesting. Maybe. Make them more of her. Featured in our in our painting. Does not feel a little bit windy? In the at least in the reference. I'm hoping I can capture that in my version by the end. But in the reference it looks nice and windy. It would be nice to get that feeling. I'm going to make this. He'll go up a little bit higher. Pier. Yeah, I'm running out of room for this little Bush here. Cool. Right. So back to foreground. Hi below welcome. I hope you're having a good day. Thanks for joining me if you have any questions, you can. Let me know if you want to paint. Along you can take the reference from below the stream description or. Under the info panel. Above the chat. OK, so now with all of stuff I've painted the pathway looks pretty out of place, so I'm just going to make a new one. I think we can do better. So I will still use the selection tool for it. I love using selection tool to make nice clean shapes and. Things like this so we'll use that and then. There's a little turn at the end, where overlaps. You're getting a little bit of like. We see over the Hill. That's a tough thing to capture I think I need to add a little bit more of the Hill. Over here. To make that work? Yeah. I think that makes more sense. OK. Get rid of the other one and then let's give a little texture to this. Path. Um. Even if we're just using color dynamics to put something in there, so it's not flat Gray that's fine. There's a little bit of a shadow I think. From Bush that I maybe have an added in yet. Little bit of a shadow over here. Yeah, so let's add them in that little Bush. He seems so comfortable with this type of styling. Well, thanks, I think I've been doing. This type of stuff in my virtual Plein Air paintings for awhile now and I'm. I don't know I'm just trying to embrace it. A little bit more like just letting myself go really loose with it. I think I've been I don't know subconsciously. Or consciously still trying to hang hang on to a little bit more. Realism whatever that means with the. With my painting an I'm trying to let myself just have more fun with it and not worry about if. If you zoom in. And it looks chaotic that's OK. I'm trying to just be OK with that an. I don't know if you guys ever feel this way, but sometimes the art that you like. Ann. The art that you make can be. Different and that's also OK 'cause for example, I like a lot of different types of art styles and I don't paint in all those styles. But I started to notice with these with a landscape painting and things that a lot of the art that I really, really loved. With all these textures, and everything I just notice the pattern, a lot of these artists were like really brave in their mark making and. It didn't seem so worried about realistic. Things as much as they were focused on moods. So I'm trying to embrace that in my own art and just let myself be a little bit more free with. Um. But the textures and things like that. No hands you that's funny that you. Guest that somehow but yeah, me and Mills have known each other for a long time. Very long time now. It looks like a River that's funny. We were saying that about the last one to the painting I did right before this. Had. Pathway also that kind of like a River to the bus at the beginning. Will have to paint the paint will have to make a painting with a real River in it soon. But this one is a pathway. And I think I will desaturate it a little bit, it's a dirt road it does reflect a little bit of the Sky. The color in the Sky, but Yeah, it's pretty desaturated. Thank you. Thank you for the next comments. OK, so. It will keep going, adding these little Bush is and things until at least I feel like there is enough. We can go back in and. Do a little bit more detail and improve them. I'm going to flip the reference and flip my canvas. I like to flip horizontally. A lot because it helps me notice mistakes and things. Proportions it just tricks you into tricks your brain into having a fresh look at the painting it kind of. You kind of reprocess the image in your brain a little bit and sometimes just notice things you didn't notice. So I want to have a little bit more of a subtle transition between the pathway in the dirt. So. I think I will take a Darker color for shadow. Here at the end and kind of blend that because there is a little bit more of A. Subtle transition. How long have you been doing streams full time now? I've been streaming about 2 1/2 years and? Basically, I was full time streaming almost that whole time at the beginning of the time that I was. That I was streaming I was also doing other work as well. But I kind of jumped in and started streaming a lot of hours from the time that I began streaming. Before that I was. Basically still doing the painting at home. I'm still working working from home doing painting for. Significant portion of the day. Anne I decided it would be nice to you. Hang out with some other people, while doing that and. Yeah, I'm very I'm very passionate about. Learning and sharing techniques. With art and painting and. So I decided to share my journey of. Studying learning and teaching what I. Discover along the way. But it's crazy, I think that it's been that long. Everything like these little. They're not really path, but Little openings in between. The Tufts of grass isn't things. Not sure how to illustrate that. There's all these little. Little Tufts and they kind of form like groups and paths and stuff like they're not evenly spaced. That's a beautiful thing about nature. It's not like. They are evenly spaced like this and you kind of want to avoid that your painting that's something that I do sometimes it's like accidentally. Make things even everything even and kind of like the same size and I tried to work against that. Um. And make a little bit more variety in the size of things that distance between them. Stuff like that for more natural look. Oh, cool, you should do it hanji. Had that's that's awesome. Just tuned in what are you using to paint hyfab I am painting in Photoshop, I'm using CC 2019 right here. And if you have any. Give me other questions welcome to let me know. Yeah, there's some purple shadows. All these little. Little Tufts. Not sure exactly like what the plans are but. They have kind of A. Purple color to them at least in this lighting now. This whole lighting scenario is probably affecting that. Oh, the tablet I have a Wakeham Centriq 22. So it is a screen. It is a screen tablet and I'm using the stylus to paint. I know you can't see it in the? In the video, but Yeah, I'm really happy with this tablet also. I got it kind of recently in October. And. I really love it. I think it could be Heather, Oh that makes sense that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, probably is Heather. Hi AC how are you? Thank you. Oh yeah, she probably look at the time. So I think we've been painting this for around 40 minutes, something like that. So. That's not too bad. Uhm I will probably keep going for. For awhile longer I was aiming for between an hour and a half hour and a half for this one. We'll see how long it takes to bring things together. I've been keeping things on separate layers a little bit more than I did for the first painting today because. I'd like to do some more work in the Sky. So let's actually work on the Sky a little bit more now kind of feeling. Inspired over here, there's some. Some textures, some interesting textures. In the clouds even if you look at the actual actual reference. You think of clouds as being soft, but You get a lot of these little wispy textures, and stuff that I think yeah, it can be really interesting. Want to get a tablet. I tried a few but still unsure yeah, it's a big decision so big decision. For me, I watched so many videos and things before getting a tablet an I think yeah. I think it's OK to take your time you know. It's a big decision. I'm doing good. Thank you enjoying the paintings. Today I've been trying to do some texture experiments and things and just. Be a little bit looser with the. Detailed wizan work on texture. So that's been the goal. Today I've enjoyed enjoying the painting, relaxing environment painting is always relaxing to me. And less OK, there's an exception and less, I'm painting environments with a lot of perspective if there's a lot of. Perspective it's not necessarily relaxing. I still like it. More relaxing with fully natural type of scene, I think. Thank you Bob Joe he'd isadora thanks everybody welcome. If you guys want to see the reference that I'm using you can look below the stream in the info. Are below the streaming description or in the info panel and the reference will be there? And you're welcome to paint with me if you like the reference. And you want to do a little study as well. You're welcome to paint and share what you do in the chat. Anytime the time. Doing studies on stream I like to share my reference and. You're welcome to join in I think it's more fun. I think it's more fun to study. As a group plus it's nice to see how people different people different styles approach the same kind of setting. I definitely learned a lot from seeing. Doing a painting and then seeing how someone else has. You know decided to solve certain certain problems and things and seen. Give you a new way of looking at things. Hi Ramco High Mattie want to use the color Picker on the reference. So I don't use the color. Picker just because I'm trying to practice being able to. That being able to look at a color and select it myself, I want to improve my understanding of color theory. In general and Yeah, I just want to be able to paint without relying on having to have a photo reference. Uhm this is just a personal this is something that I've decided personally but I don't think that it's. Necessarily requirement lots of artists have different workflows and some people you know color pic from photos and that's part of their. Workflow and I think that's fine, but I feel that I've. Gotten a lot faster with my painting since getting away from color picking from the references so that's been a nice benefit from it. Does the color picker knowledge the reference uhm not really? I think you have to what you can do is? If you hold alt bring up the color picker if you hold all outside of. Pure ref and then. Glide over onto it, it will I think pick colors? But if you try to just hover over this and hold alt it won't bring up the color Picker. So that's kind of a way you can do that, but Hum that's just answer your question Kate and hello. Where do you put the canvas? Yeah, I do flip the canvas often it's like a habit the reason I do it is because. It helps give me a fresh look at the painting so. I flip my reference to on my other monitor. I have the reference next to the chat like in a full. Size an I flip both of them and it just helps me notice if something is wrong, you know it forces your brain to like really. Process what you're looking at and it's with landscapes. I mean, I find it still helpful it's most. A parent or it makes more of a dramatic help when you're painting portraits or something like that. If you flip it if you flip the portrait you'll notice all of a sudden that. Maybe one of the eyes is like too low or something your brain will just suddenly see it. It's just little trick to get a fresh look at the painting. Sometimes I flipped because it's easier to make a brush stroke from One Direction or the other depending on if you're right or left handed. It might be easier for you to make a brush stroke from a certain direction. That's another reason to flip but usually I'm doing it just to. Just to see how it looks if you can have your painting working from both directions. Then things are probably. Then you got it probably things are probably working pretty well. All thank you Isadora. Thank you. I think the way the smooth texture in some areas of these clouds might be might be my chance. To use the mixer brush I don't know. I really love the mixer brush, but I get confused sometimes using it. The only downside is I would have to merge. Stuff. Well, you don't have to but. Yeah, I think I think I would like to wait a little bit longer, maybe after I emerged. I'll do it. Oh, thank you. Thank you Marty. Appreciate that. Welcome everybody. Yeah, I will wait on the mixer brush, but I might use at the end after I merge stuff will see. So. OK so I want to go back to the pathway in the foreground and all that stuff, I try to move around the painting. So that I don't let anyone area start to get completely finished while other areas are really falling behind. It's Specially, when you're doing a quick time study. You don't want to get sucked into too many details in one area. I'm just saying this from experience. 'cause that's how I used to run out of time on time studies. It's like getting to suck then and next thing you know you're out of time and you painted. One area like Super Nice. And then everything else is not done so. Yeah, I tried to. Try to keep that in mind, and move around the canvas and also it helps give you a good picture of how things are working relative to each other you know. You can kind of build the painting up together. OK. So. I think it might be time for me to merge things finally. I'm being a little timid about it. Um. I want to put a little bit more. Let's put a little bit more texture into this. Tree. Little little less saturated and more towards blue. There's like a blue Gray color to the groups of leaves here. Oh, nice. I really like the color palette in this whole area. This whole scene and I like seeing things like this in person too. Going for walks in areas that look like this. I don't know at all, what the temperature might be in this place. But. Seems. Seems perfect. It seems like it would be. A little Breezy. And cool but not cold. OK. I think I'm going to compromise on the merging the whole thing with emerging I'm going to merge everything. Um. On 2 one layer except the Sky. I'm going to merge the Sky down onto underpainting so we have this and then this. This layer and this layer. Um. Thank you for the nice comments. Jackson says I'm going to call my version done send it directly in the trash bin tried going full opacity brush like what I did with the line tool, he'd mistake. Without law, so the shapes are garbage. It's so hard. It's so hard to make super strong shapes without the lasso tool. Like I find brushes that are like squares or triangles, or something like that can help but it's tough. I really like this brush because of that. Well, Hey. You know how it is. Still, worth still worth the study even if you don't like the result. We still learn even if we're just learning something we don't want to do next time still counts. Still, counts. OK, I'm going to try the mixer brush. I'm going to duplicate my background layer in case I don't like. What I do? Um so we have the mixer brush here. I'm kind of new to the mixer brush so. It's a little experimental but basically this these settings. I was messing with the other well the last time I. Used it and I like this, this kind of wet paint smear or smudge kind of effect that it gets. It looks very. Like oil painting kind of feeling which I think is awesome. So. Mostly, where I see this is let me show the reference really quick up close, you can see. This area right here in the reference doesn't, it look like a paint stroke. That's what it looks like to me, it looks like a? It looks already like a paint stroke, which is awesome. It gives us a good idea of what we can do. So this has been really the extent of my personal use of the mixture brushes like I don't really paint with it, but sometimes. After I've already painted I like to come in on Top of that and add some individual brush strokes. 2. You know the kind of like accents and give a little. A little extra. Will texture stuff like that? So if I turn this layer on and off you can see the changes and. I don't know I don't know if it's better or not, but. Something fun to play with. Any more practice with it. Really but Let's let's flip let's try from this direction. One thing that's nice is these smoother textures in the background. Make the textures of the tree and everything like that, really stand out as being. Um. Get more sharp and noisy. Then the smooth Sky and that makes the Sky look. Extra. Soft. Yeah, it's really changing. Changing a lot, but I think I like it. So one thing that you can do is I like to do this alot is erased out. So if I do something I'll kind of look and see well what do I like about what I did? Was there something I liked more about the original? I did like this angle? Here, like that. One curve's going to bring that back in. And other than that I kind of like I like some of the changes so I'll just let it be. Except for erasing through that one area. I'm going to make a new layer and choose yeah, we'll just stay on normal mode, but I want to. Grab the airbrush. And give a little bit of glow. Around the opening of the. For clouds to the Sky behind there. Just need to brighten things up a little bit. Will you shift that until it feels right? Yeah something a little cooler maybe? OK. Well, if anybody else is painting along I hope it's going well. Hope you're enjoying the painting. You can also use the smudge brush to get some type of similar effects that the mixer brush can get as far as. Traditional painting kind of feeling I think that I think is much brush is really nice for some soft blending and. Things that feel like smudged wet paint and stuff like that softening areas getting some edges to be lost. Sometimes it's nice to smudge things a little bit as they get into the distance. You know it really helps give that feeling of. Heping further away and in this situation, it almost makes it look like it's raining back there, it's kind of cool. I like you. All right. I think a new layer and. I think it's time for me to try to start putting finishing things in this finishing textures and. Things that I want to pull this together and. And call this study done. So. I think this tree is one area that can use the little extra love. I want to add a little bit of more individual. Maybe not individual leaves. But you know smaller groups of leads to make it look a little bit more detailed. And I can either I can also either erase out or just paint over color picking from the Sky. And paint little areas back in so for example. You know, so that we can see the tree trunk a little bit more again. We can kind of paint in around there. Graphics is it does look like a windy day. I think it's from the Sky and what you're doing with the brush strokes makes it feel that way. How it's in every direction and stuff thanks rocky? Thank you always happy if UR. If you can get across that kind of mood. Hi Eduardo welcome. I think that foliage looks really beautiful when there's Even a little bit of wind, you know. Makes them look extra lively bushes and trees. The emphasizes the The gesture and the motion of the leaves. I want to give a little bit more of a brighter green. Here and there's also some little Bush is down here that I kind of missed. Will paint them in now or maybe switch brushes and paint them in. Uhm I moved to the Netherlands abouts. Um. About a year and a half ago custio something around there. My boyfriend is from here so. That's why that's why I'm here. Originally, I'm from America. I am from the East Coast. I grew up in Florida, but I believed in a few different places on the East Coast USA. Alright I'm going to check on the time. Right so I have about if I want to keep on track with how long I wanted to spend on this. I have about 15 minutes left so I think that's pretty good through add some more details and things. Let's see what it looks like after that point. Hi James, Trying to find the right color for these little Tufts of possibly Heather. We were talking about. Oh wow that's awesome. Eduardo I'm happy to hear that. I'm really happy that the tips are helping. Welcome James thanks for coming over. Hope you're having a good day. OK, so a little bit more work, a little bit more in the area where the path and the. The dirt kind of come together maybe I can. Make that look like a more natural transition. OK, James I was wondering what happened. Thank you for that public service announcement. Right so a little bit of overlap of dirt onto the sidewalk here. This is a dusty road and there's wind blowing and. You know they're not going to it's not going to be all super clean so we want a little bit of that. And Oh yeah, there's uh. Going to be a little bit. I want a little bit of a shadow coming across the path from this little. Little Bush here. Hey red welcome. Ha ha ha. I'm having a little bit of trouble with all the chaos that's happening over here. It's some in the actual painting, I mean, sorry an actual reference not my painting, I find it really beautiful. How these little like windy paths of Heather kind of? Coming down and I don't I think mine as I was talking about earlier there a little too evenly spaced. And I want them to kind of formal trails so I'm going to try to fix that now. James says these overcast paintings are really valuable for concept stuff being able to control streaks of light really gives you the ability to control the read of the subject silhouette. Ooh that's really interesting. Yeah, I like I was mentioning earlier. I really like these kind of moods. But I find it. I find it hard to well, sometimes it's hard to paint over cast stuff because there's not I don't know I just think without the. Dramatic dappled lighting kind of look the pops of light sometimes it can be. Sometimes it can be hard to get a strong of a mood for me, but I really like I really like these kind of scenes. I like the mood of them. And I'd like to get better at painting them and also it's hard for me to find great references of cloudy days. I think there must be hard to photograph. So when I saw this one, I was really excited. This was one from Google Street View map crunch. And I thought it was really nice image. Um so do discord mixer brush just a blender, but lends leaving a canvas texture. It's pretty cool Oh. So much. Thank you for sharing that with me. I'm excited to try it. Police has a lot of muted colors and overcast conditions. Yeah, that's true that's true. But this painting is making me want to do a little bit more. Moody stuff, which I guess is good. Being that it's it's autumn. Maybe I can take some photos. Oh, thank you for the tip. Good bunch of solid overcast shots in those free no Bradley packs on gumroad the ones from schottland, especially. OK, I have those packs downloaded I will check in there for that. Good tip. The 18 Gigabyte Giant. Reference pack. You guys can search for that, if you if you don't know what we're talking about. James wrote the artist name in the chat Noah Bradley, you guys might know him already it's really amazing artist. If you look him up because a reference really, really big reference pack that he shares for free on line. Lots of different landscapes and things so if you want to do some studies of those it's really good. Hum. Nice quality images to paint from. Going to do a little like sketching and cross hatching here, sometimes that's fun to do. As well along with the. Painting 'cause it can give a different texture. Still, a little bit, yeah, I'm still trying to keep things bit stylized. And there's a bunch of little pebbles and textures of. Random dried. Plants. And stuff like that so. And the link posted yeah that's nice of you Mills, you can go ahead and post it. Ha ha ha. That's so funny. So brave so brave right James Yeah, he recently put up. Some anatomy reference packs too. OK, it's definitely going in the right direction, I think. So I'll merge that down so we still have basically the Sky and everything else. So I want to paint some a little bit more bright NIS behind the trees and everything in the Sky. Oops well, I don't mean to zoom in sorry. Um a little bit more brightness back here in the reference. It's the contrast is pretty intense. There. In a couple of places. So I'd like to brighten it up. There's a couple of slivers in the Sky that are really, really bright and it's. Very pretty. Oh, cool that's awesome James. She also streams here. In case you. Yeah, in case he didn't follow her here yet. Oh, you're welcome, I hope you enjoy the brushes. So I'm running into something right now where just to kind of like assess the progress of this. I like how. I like how about Top of the. The Top portion of the composition is working in regard to the texture. For example, there's some areas with the colour dynamics on and then there's some. Areas without it where the your eyes can kind of rest a little bit. I think as much as I love color dynamics brushes. I think I'm running into a thing in the foreground where it's just too busy. Over here on the left on the right. I think it's working again. There's some area where there's a little bit more rest your eyes can rest a little bit. Over here it's like. Too busy in my opinion, so I'm going to try to. Maybe add some clean shapes so for example, I really like in the reference this one. Area. Where we get we were looking through the foliage. We see through to the dirt and it's just dusty it has a light texture, but it's small. Text I like you know, small little pebbles, so from a distance. There's really just. You know. Not very textured so. Oh, thank you. That's awesome. Yeah, I hope you I hope you enjoy them. If you do some more. I love the first one, you did. And what James is talking about if anybody wants to join in is. Through my discord server, which you can find a link to it on my profile here on Behance If you're watching this later. For people that are watching live I can give you a quick. Link in the chat if you want to join my discord server. We're doing every 2 weeks or studying a different subject matter and we're starting portraits right now an I put a bunch of. Reference images in there and anyone is welcome to join in with the studies and share their art in the discord. So. Yeah, I'm really glad you like the reference images. I pick images from places like Pexels Unsplash, so places that are have royalty free images that you. Able to use for study and things like that with your art. So you don't have to worry about that, if you if anybody wants to do. Can grab those references in paint paint along? Yeah, well that really didn't tone down the? The business this is kind of added to it, OK will try something else. Let's get a brush that is. Pretty smooth, maybe I'll try that or I don't hate the idea of having texture. But I just need something a little bit more clean than what is there? So. Maybe. Just going to stay zoomed out so I can really see how this looks at a distance, but And then we have some dirt overlapping the The path here. Let's flip I think that's better. Kind of hard to say. Let's keep going. I think it's a little better. Will try to establish some shapes of individual little little plants or Bush is here and that might help, too. Not have it be so chaotic if we can see somewhere. Where one plant ends and then behind it is just dirt area something like that. Look up a little. Little Tufts. So Cute, Happy little plants. And then in the foreground they get really big. So we're pretty close to these ones that are. Right near us here on the left we flip again get fresh look. So this kind of getting towards the end here. I can make sense of this stuff, then I feel like it'll be it'll be ready to be finished. So I'm going to grab a different brush. And paint some of these little. Grass is that I think part of what makes this scene look nice and windy is there's a bunch of. These little grass is that are kind of bending and swaying over. And they do have a little bit of a gradient to them, so we're going to add that in. But I'm going to start with just a paying attention only to the shape. Oh, James those schools in winter sales soon, maybe within a week. If you're looking to take some more courses. Good to know good to know Oh my gosh, it's. So this time of year. Crazy. Crazy. Hi Marty welcome. Right so I sketched in a bunch of these on the other side, there's also one pretty close up here. I think that adds a lot of windy windiness. Couple little puffs here and there and then I have a brush that I like to use for a grassy type textures. It's a brush that looks a lot like paint stroke, which I like. Little more traditional kind of feeling. I sing welcome back. So this way. We can kind of paint over those little areas with some extra texture, which I think is nice. Although I hope I'm not asking too much. It's going to make it hard to understand what's going on here again. OK, so I'm going to lock that layer and grab the Airbrush. And for each of these groups of grass is down near the base. I'm just going to give it a little bit of. Shading like this and it is just something it doesn't take long at all. Just really quickly. And then you can also do the opposite and. No. Bring things up at the Top. Henderson yeah, we have some happy little trees here. Alright I think that's OK, I will take the same brush. And the only thing I don't like is for example, you see down here. This little grasp coming out of nowhere. I kind of like a better transition. You know, maybe put some little texture on the ground or something there. I don't know what the answer is but. There needs to be something. For me. Alright, it's almost done. One thing I notice on this this. Pathway this road here is that there's a little bit of lighter. Highlights around the edges, I don't know. It has something to do with where the areas. Are worn out where the vehicles drive and stuff like that? But. I think it's going to cool. Like that in. Alright. Well, this one turned out a little bit busier than maybe I would have liked in some places. But overall, I think I think I like it. Going to add a couple little random. There's little random stones. An rocks and things and I think it would be nice to maybe add a couple of them just because it brings. A little bit of that, Gray Blue into the rest of the environment here. Yeah, I think I think it's done. All right. Think it's done for now. Let's see did I miss anything in the chat. If you guys if anybody was painting along with this reference an you want to share your welcome to you. If you need more time you don't have to rush you can take your time I'm going to be. Working on another one, so you can share share it. Whenever you want if you do want to. And. I'll make sure I save this. Thank you. Marty thank you so here's here's the paintings, we've done today. Different moods, but Similar kind of thing with a pathway and a lot of foliage. This was the first one, and then. Different mood here. Thank you. Thanks, Ryan. So. We're going to do one more and again, I'm choosing um choosing references that are a little bit more. Straightforward like not crazy perspective, I don't want to have like houses or boats or you know stuff like that. I'm choosing references that a little bit more straightforward so I can experiment textures, and stuff. I'm going to grab another one, from the discord and I hope you guys will like it. I'm trying to choose. Which one to go for maybe maybe you guys can give me your opinion? Maybe you can give me your opinion I'll let you. You can just say in the chat what you like OK, I'm going to show 2. 2 possibilities of what we can paint. So we have, like a sunny day. Blue Sky. A little. Trees. On the right side of the road kind of thing and then we have. Like a little bit more cloudy. The water stuff like that. The River one. Says Mills Lisas. I like them. All Heather says pond one with the water OK. I'm hearing more suggestions for the one with the water. So let's do that. The water OK alright chat has spoken. I will add the reference real quick for anybody that wants to download it. And join me in a painting. That I copied the right link. Alright so I'm going to add it to the info panel. An I'll also add it below the stream in the description just in case and I'll put the? 360 degree view if you want to like browse around it's kind of fun to see. You can look at the. The 360 degree view and I turned around, I mean, this is pretty too like. There's so many good views. I kind of focused in on this area. But yeah, you could make a painting of like multiple different angles of this. I kind of want to focus in on one area so that it doesn't get too. Overwhelming with the sheer amount of detail and things to include so I think. Yeah, well will zoom in a little bit, but if you want you can. Explore that. The Pond, the water all thank you Marty. Too late to be contrary that's OK. I like the other one too. I will probably will probably save the other one for a future painting. So. My digital pen, I'm using a Wakeham Centriq 22. That is my my tablet. Alright so let's get set up for one more painting. And I'm going to put the painting on my other monitor next to the chat in a larger size. Um. Oh, the info panel has the wrong name. Hum. I wonder what happened wonder what I did. They both have the same. URL. Let me try this again. That was weird. OK. Alright hope that works now. Alright so new canvas, I will put my. Reference here and let's see how big my canvases. We will make this a little bigger, maybe like 2500 pixels wide something like that. I will keep it in the same aspect ratio as the reference. It's updated now OK thank you. Mills thanks for letting me know. So the only thing that I think is a little. Tough about this. One thing that's a little bit tough about this. Reference is the. The composition I think. I think overall it's It's OK, but The fact that there's if I'm just going to sketch it out really quick. The fact that there's this kind of thing happening where? I feel like we're almost closed of- a little bit by the way that the land is coming from the side here. Do you know what I mean, so I'm thinking? Maybe we can change the composition a little bit and either have? The water just go all the way across or maybe we can have a little opening where it's like a River that comes closer to us. I think I might change the composition a little bit. I don't know I don't know if it's too ambitious. But I think we can maybe make it a little bit more like drawing the viewer in. To the the composition a little bit or maybe adding a Bush in the foreground, something feels not perfect to me about the composition. But I do like the setting so. We'll see what we can do with it. Hi using more welcome. Welcome welcome. OK. So let's get started and the time for me is around 3:30 so. I'm going to do the same thing and we're going to do about maybe between an hour, an hour and a half on this painting just depending on how it goes and. See see how much time we need. Did I say this? Save the file before we start this is the references in Estonia. I think. Yeah. All thanks thanks Kate. Thank you. I think I will keep going with the workflow from today, so I've been doing an underpainting for these. And I've been using my rectangle brush with color dynamics on. And just the beginning with a warmer like medium tone background that I know it looks crazy at this. There's size on this stage but. So starting with something like that, and then. Just a roughly. Roughly indicating the The values as well so. We're going to have a little bit of a break in the clouds here. Or will see to the blue Sky, the Sky is mostly white, mostly white clouds, mostly Gray you know pretty bright. And then We've got Lake here with some reflective. Qualities, which really pretty maybe will have it maybe I'll just make the Lake bigger or something. And then Some pushes The row of bushes behind there. And then the trees. I really like this, I really like this tree. I really like the way that you can kind of feel the weight of the branches. And I've got a group of looks like a couple trees here in the middle. Then couple more over on the side here. The only problem is, I'm running into the situation that I have a lot, where it's like I don't really want everything to be. Evenly spaced, I think it will look nicer if the scene doesn't have such. Perfectly spaced things from each other so for example, maybe I can make this. These are. Trees. Closer to this other one a little bit larger and then put a space here and then put a smaller one. You know just keep it. I want it to feel balanced but not symmetrical. I don't think this is necessarily feels balanced but. To start will figure it out. Yeah, that's interesting to hear Mills. I do think it's kind of a similar idea in the sense that I'm not using like a ton of different values just kind of breaking it down too. Um. Yeah, simpler more simplified version of the. Of the composition is that's what I'm trying for C Oh, thank you welcome. OK, I think. OK, like this. Let's get started and I'll try to keep my underpainting layer in case I need to refer back to this 'cause I do think that at this point. It's a good expression of what I want. For this painting. I make sure this is saving OK. So let's start with the background again as far as the Sky will work back to front and I've been enjoying this. Wispy light texture brush and. Let's start with like a medium blue Gray color for the clouds. Maybe maybe I'll start with darker color and then we'll add highlights. I'm not sure this so usually what will look at is. What is the most dominant color? Is it's the clouds mostly bright are they mostly in shadow it's like on the left. There's a lot of shadow on the right images Little Overexposed Maybe. And it's pretty bright usually whatever is the most dominant thing I'll start with that and then add the other thing as an accent whether it's shadows or highlights and it's kind of hard to tell on this one. But. I'm just going to keep it really loose. And try to focus on the overall feeling of the lighting more than anything else. So it's pretty great back here. Yeah, that's one weakness of this reference is that some of the Sky is kind of overexposed so it's not. That parts model, not too easy to work with, but overall, especially because I've painted a good amount of. Landscapes at this point, so I'm hoping that I can kind of fill in a little bit. From my knowledge from previous paintings. And I want to paint in that little. Patch of blue in the Sky. Oh, that's really bright OK, not that not that much. See sometimes in, not color picking from the reference. It takes me. Awhile to find the right color. Sometimes they get in the first try and sometimes I have to. Kind of fish around for it, but Overall, I'm getting faster at selecting the right color. By trying to practice. My color picking getting better. It was really great area over here. And down here there's a few kind of similar scenarios, the last painting. A little little slivers of light shining through the clouds here. And there's a little bit of like a warm purple think I'm just starting to see that. I mean, it's very, very light. But the clouds have some kind of warmth in them. It's not all cold is not all of these saturated. Do you draw fantasy animals? Not so much I I do environments and then I also at least in the past if you look at My Portfolio. I've drawn a lot of characters and. Things like that I've done fantasy characters like elves and fairies and all that kind of stuff but. I haven't done a lot of creature design. It doesn't interest me as much as other things, but You never know you never know I used to not be very interested in landscape painting and then now. Look at me, it's like my favorite thing to do so. You never know what's going to happen. With your art. Let me this has been the hardest one for me to start so far. Let's Look in black-and-white sometimes that helps. If anybody is painting along with me, I hope it's hope it's going well. I hope you're having an easier time. OK. So we have some crazy stuff mapped in for the Sky right now. I'm going to leave it as it is I don't really. I don't really like it, but I think I'm having trouble visualizing the Sky without having any contrast of. The. Without having any contrast of the other parts of the image. Let me try your first landscape. There was actually a few things that happened sort of simultaneously to cause me to get into landscape painting. One of the things was me and my boyfriend were actually doing some streams together, we were doing some dual streams together. Where we were? Taking random requests and suggestions on what to paint an we painted a few scenes with animals and some. Landscapes and things like that, and that was one of my first forays into like timed paintings where you. Get some kind of a prompt an just kind of do your best. But I wasn't taking them super seriously. It was kind of for fun. But then I had a giveaway where I basically gave away a Commission. I let someone decide what I would paint for them. And that person wanted me to pay a landscape so that was the first landscape that I took a long time on and really like put a lot of work into and that's actually my. Starting soon screen here. This was like the first landscape that I. Me to finished illustration of and put time into kind of thing before that, I just done like click. Landscape sketching things. So that was interesting that that's it turned into that. That I ended up really liking, it, but ironically like I didn't. I didn't jump right in and start like loving landscapes right after doing that. I didn't end up getting into it more heavily until a while later. So I'm just kind of painting over my underpainting here to get an idea. Wow, that's so bright going to lower the Opacity on that. I'm going to save a separate copy of my underpainting and then start merging things down. It was effects animator. On Twitch, who won the. Their Commission give away and. Through I painted it for. And one of the reasons that he chose that specifically was because I didn't do a lot of landscape painting. And. He looks like I want to see you do this and I was like. OK. If I must. Favorite is green color fantasy girl in your portfolio all thank you. Thank you I'm happy you like it. OK, so there's a? A Lake here, the water reflection, which I really liked with my favorite part of this. Whole scene, I think. So I want to try to find the right color for it. It's very dark. It ran color dynamics again. I really like, adding Blues and Purples in the shadows when I paint. Specially, if I'm painting green. Next Green Foliage Anna. At least partially Sunny Bay. A little bit about blue bounce lay everywhere. So I'm basically starting with the midtones, he ran just working up to. You know, adding darker colors right now. Adding shadows and will go back in with highlights kind of go back and forward back and forth. Until this starts to come together and feel like something that we can recognize. I put a little bit more space in between these trees because I was hoping it would. Make something look a little. Different between the groupings, so it wasn't just the same type of grouping over and over, we'll see we'll see how it looks. In the end, you can always go back and do closer to what's in the reference 'cause. We know at least that's working? At least it's working well enough. Really bright green. Color for all these grass is here. This is the kind of green that I used to kind of avoid even though it's a really there. In the reference it's a really bright green. I think that's all I'm seeing it. Um. This color can often come across looking kind of fake you know. Almost seems too, vibrant to be true. Sometimes these greens really exist. I found that uhm. Adding a little bit more yellow. To the green can make it look a little bit more natural. An earthy. But I like the UM the contrast of the warm and cool greens like for example, up here. On this little this little Hills Little Ridge. There's more blue green at the Top. And there's a few layers of it to going back into the distance. Few layers of. Foliage. Rose of Plants. I'm staying zoomed out as much as I can at this stage because it really helps me see the whole. The whole scene, you know together as 1. One image and I'm not get lost in little details as much. I mean, I'm still capable of getting lost in details with this. Range but it helps it helps. I'm going to merge down and just aside from the underpainting. I'm just going to paint this thing on one layer. I think basically. When I say I'm painting on one one layer. I'm not really actually painting only on one layer but. What I'm doing is? Usually, making a new layer above the layer with my painting and painting on that layer for awhile and then I'll turn the layer on and off and kind of compare. What I've done over the last few minutes and if I like the progress then I'll just move merge it down. So it's a way of like I'm still utilizing layers. In a way I'm not totale painting on one layer but. I'm still getting more of a traditional look to the painting 'cause I'm painting as if it's flat and. Rather than kind of. Imagining you know going through this layer to adjust one thing and then go into the layer below it for another thing. I like to paint this way when I'm doing studies if I'm doing a full illustration. It's generally smart to keep. At least some separate things so you can make changes then if you need to more easily first studies. I find more freedom and. Enjoyment out of? Merging stuff. So that's so that's it. Basically turn this on and off so look OK. Alright merge it down and make a new. Layer. So I kind of give myself a little bit before I commit to what I've done 'cause. Sometimes I will look at it an? Get rid of it, you guys have seen it do that before even today like there was a couple of things that I decided. So it doesn't look so good I'm going to try again to paint that thing. Hi Sebastian, Welcome. I like that, we can see the tree trunks, popping out peeking out from below, some of these trees. Find the right color for them. But basically like this. I'm going to paint them right now, just mainly concerned with the. The shape that I'm creating I'm not really worrying about color or anything right now. That way I can. Lock the layer. And then grab whatever color I want to use is like a shadow. And just give a little just painting a little shadow on these. Then we'll merge it down. Has a key? Welcome. Thanks for being here, everybody if you have any questions. Please feel free to ask me and you can join in painting if you want. If anybody wants to you can take the reference image from the info panel or below the stream description. We're doing some group study here, you're also welcome to just hang out, relax enjoy the painting. Definitely want to do some more work on the Sky so. I will make a new layer and put it on maybe overlay mode. That way I can kind of add to what's there without completely painting over it will use a layer blending mode. And. Painting some highlights for example. In the clouds. Areas. Let's flip this. Now I can see maybe some. Some different things after flipping the canvas, but I didn't notice before. OK, I will merge that I do like that. Better. And I think we can make it even brighter, although let me color pick and see how close they appear way I am. It's pretty exciting pretty bright. It up more. I'm going too far. Sometimes you have to you know instead of brightening something you have to darken something else. If you want dramatic. More dramatic lighting. It's all relative you know. So behind these. Burger clouds. I'm not worried about painting over the trees. The trees are just roughly block then I'm going to paint on Top of any of these areas with the clouds are overlapping the trees. It's not a big very big worry right now whoops there goes my painting. Yeah, I heard that. So many different colors in the clouds, it's really crazy. You will close at this reference there really is a lot of little things happening. OK, new layer. Let's work on the trees. So we'll take the brush I was using earlier to actually paint the trees. Yeah, what is your questions lately? I'm going to color pic from the Sky behind the trees. I have some my tablet is a welcome centriq 22. It's the it's the new one. The new 22, so it doesn't have like the buttons around the outside. I use keyboard shortcuts, so that's why I hear a lot of clicking. But I'm drawing on the screen with a pen. Stylus. Hey Roman, you're right you're right. Sorry I missed the beginning of this Oh thank you. No worries, no worries. Thanks for being here if you if you want like if you really wanted to see. What happened earlier in stream you can always go back later after the stream is? Um finished and processed if you go to my. My profile here on Behance and look at the videos tab then you can watch any of the. Can watch any of the past streams? So yeah, it should be there. Later, an I hope the tool timeline is still running uh this happened again. I'll start it now. I have the tool timeline running at the beginning of stream. Somewhere, along the way it looks like it stopped, but I just turned it on again. But a good portion of the stream should be able to. Um. Have the tools captured for it. Oh thanks Jackson. Thank you. Hi pal, high Gray welcome everybody. Uh Matthias is your tablet interactive display. It's not a touch screen. It's but I use the Stylus on it, so. I'm not sure if that would count as interactive or what exactly but yeah, so I'm drawing on the screen. But it's not it's not a touch screen. So I can't just like you know. Um click buttons with or zoom in or anything like that without using the stylus to like select things. To make that happen. Do you work for any favourites companies? No, do you mean like doing doing paintings for like a game or movies or something like that. Um. I have nots? I've great works congratulations greetings from Cappadocia, Turkey, I great. Thank you very much. Thanks for the next comment. Do you see your traditional painting so actually I do? I do traditional painting even now if you guys want to see? Let me post a link really quick to my? Traditional artwork. Um. So. I do a gouache painting an I love it, and I do think it helps. There is my Instagram for my. Gouache painting and let me also post my digital art account as well. I do think it I do think it helps, but I don't think it's required I get it. I only say that because I get a questions a lot like from people that maybe are not so interested in traditional art. And they're more interested in digital and they asked me do I have to learn traditional first or you know. Do I have to do that, and I really don't think you have to do anything. I think that the fundamentals are the same for all those mediums, so you can just do what it is that you like. But anytime you try something new. It's going to help you, you know you're going to learn something new that you can apply. Like for me doing traditional has given me some ideas of textures, and things that I want to use in my digital painting. So I think it's given me like a different way to think about things. But I think also, if I were to get into 3D modeling or something like that, it would happen equal. Effect as far as like I would I would learn new things that I would probably would probably influence my painting. So. Yeah, it does, but I don't think you have to do it. And thank you very much Roman. Thank you for that. E Ray you can. What I'm using for the reference images pure ref? I will post a link to where you can download it. In the chat. Heather says I started doing 3D renders and my drawings improved. I got better idea of how the human body bends. Yeah, that makes sense. It's like just so you know you get introduced to a new way of thinking about things you know, some different. Information it just it's always going to influence you when you learn something new. I think it's great. But I don't think that you know you have to do anything specific. If you want to do it, I think that's awesome. But you know. For anybody that wants to get into digital art. I don't think you have to do traditional first or anything like that. Um Sebastian you can download this brush an on with the info panels above the chat. I didn't make this brush. It's been shared around a lot. I've seen this brush in a lot of brush packs. Ann. What I do is I like to turn on color dynamics? When I use it not every time but? It gives a cool effect, so sometimes when I use it, I put color dynamics on. Hi Alan, Hi baby, thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks for being here. How did you find map crunch Oh? How did I originally find it? I follow a lot of artists that do virtual Plein Air paintings and I can't remember who initially was the one using map crunch but. A lot of artists that I follow use the use map crunch to find references for doing practice paintings and things. Yeah, I can't I can't remember who is originally the one that I found it through. But yeah, it's pretty popular for this kind of study. And it's fun like I have a whole channel in my discord server where I post cool places that I find. I'm not French or on Google Street View and I'll post the link really quick to the server and chat. But yeah, it's called Virtual Plein air in the server that's also the name of this type of painting. If you want to like research more artists that are doing this. It's a great hashtag to follow. It's a great hashtag to follow virtual pleinair you'll see a lot of really interesting stuff. Inspiring. So I'm painting in some ways that were areas. Where were you know peeking through the trees seen through to the Sky behind there. And now I can fix this tree a little bit so I can come back in front of it. Come back in front of the clouds that would make more sense. You're welcome here a? Thank you. My French looks like random streets, yeah, let me show you something about it really quick 'cause it might help with people are looking. So if you if you go to map crunch common you click go. Um you'll get random streets, mostly 'cause. It's the Google Street View car there just driving around. So this is actually pretty cool, but, yeah, you could go and you'll get you'll get maybe like the side of the road you never know what you're going to get but. Sometimes it's something really interesting. That. Look at that So what you can do is click on the options and click on a specific country. If you want to get. View in that country. You can also go to the map and drag and drop the little person an when you do this you're more likely to get. Like beautiful or famous places. I don't really know how it works, but I think that they are selecting places based on like popularity or something so you'll find some more. It's an easier way to find like paint rible things. But yeah, that's the way you can use that to find. Places. Ah thanks Michael. Hi Mama, Your traditional works are beautiful too. Thank you. Thank you so much, yeah, I'm. I started doing gouache painting about a year ago, now and I have really, really loved it and it's been. I think a good influence on my digital painting also. Before that, I had done traditional work like my whole life, I started drawing traditionally. I just never really did painting. I went from traditional drawing to digital painting. I think some of you probably know what I mean, I think this is probably not super unique. Imagine other people do this too because drawing is a little bit more accessible traditionally than painting like you always just grab a pencil. And draw. You know without necessarily having all the supplies and getting into painting and then when I got my first. Painting was in digital and then. Now I'm going also to traditional paintings, so been interesting path back and forth between traditional and digital when I first got into digital art. I stopped doing traditional for like 5 years. And it wasn't like there was a rule or something like Oh, I must stop. I just felt I don't know I just really got hooked in and wanted to focus intensely on one thing. I felt like I was learning photo shop. I was learning. A lot at one time and it felt helpful to me to like really focusing on that, but It was nice finally to like bring them together and start doing both a little bit so. Let me take a look at what time it is. Alright we're doing OK I think uhm. I might work on this for another like 30 minutes. And hopefully we can get it, looking finished in that time. I don't think it's quite there yet, but this scene has a lot of detail in it, so. It's OK if it takes a little longer. Thank you for the nice comments. Thank you. Everybody have you tried sci-fi painting not really. I painted some sci-fi characters. I don't know if that counts? Uhm I haven't done. Like a spaceships or something like that, I feel I feel like it's. It's a lot of technical things in perspective and stuff like that that you need for example. If I did 3D modeling that would be great. 'cause then I could model some of those places and paint on Top of it, but I feel like. I mean? I might be just putting restrictions on myself that don't exist. But I feel like for sci-fi. It just requires a lot more. Technical stuff in general, so I really am most inspired by a very natural type of scenes like you see me painting here, you know. Nature and Environment scenes are my favorite. But I do like sci-fi as a John rhe. Since for some reason, it's not what I am really. Inspired to paint. You never know what's going to happen, though. Could be in my future? It did only like character paintings for. In the 1st. Few years that I did digital art. And got into landscape. San now I'm kind of getting starting to paint characters again. If you guys are interested in that maybe I can do some here as well. On portrait or character things In addition to landscapes. Started practice a digital painting, it's so cool, but you're painting in a different form. Nice. Well, thank you for painting with me. Yeah, I like to try different workflows a lot, so I won't always paint in the exact same way every time. 'Cause I feel like I'm always still experimenting to try to find like a new way to do things or. Get a better texture or like I want to try this new brush. I'm always trying different things. So I end up with. And with some different. Workflows and I think there are definitely some patterns certain things that I always. Do but for the most part I do, I do change things up a lot in my painting workflow? Do you like do you suggest anything about color picking it's always a pain when it gets a coloring stage? For me doing a lot of these virtual Plein Air Studies without color picking from the reference really helps so. Just try to look at the reference and guess what you think the color is an then what you can do is if you can't figure it out. Then you can go to your reference and then color pick and see. How it's going so like my colors are not all correct you know you can see they're just differences? Buttom. You will get better at it as you do more and then you can. You won't have to color pics, so much from the reference but use it to like check your work. A little bit. And then try try to practice not doing it, I've done a lot of these paintings Oh my gosh. I've done, I've done like probably hundreds of them so I don't want that to discourage anyone 'cause people learn all different rates. But I'm just saying, you can definitely you just have to keep doing them you just have to keep doing it. And you will get it like 100% it's going to happen, you're going to get it, but you have to. Make a bunch of paintings. And then you won't need to color pic anymore. And you don't have to make hundreds of paintings to get to that point I was able to paint without color picking like. Earlier on in that stage. But I've just done a lot of them by now. Uhm OK sorry I'm falling behind in the chat. Welcome everybody gains have are I don't know if I'm saying your name right, but welcome an I think mails already answered you but you can download my brushes and anybody who wants to you can download them. Info tab. Um. Let's see. Hardest especially when I'm not using reference but drawing something from scratch. Yeah, yeah, OK absolutely absolutely. Um. Yeah, that's really tough. I paint a lot from reference so and even if I were if I were to want to create a new scene for myself. You're a dumb I would probably still try to find a reference that had like a similar lighting scenario or something. And use it as a guide like even if you're trying to make up a new setting it will really. No make it a lot easier. To have accurate look. Um. Yeah, this one is from Estonia. It says the location up here. This references in from Estonia. And you're right, some of the some of the map crunch. Like when you use the website it will give you results from it's a combination of? Street View images and the images from people that uploaded their images, so you can depending on what you get. Yeah, you can always look down in the bottom corner and it will say whether it's an individual's uploaded the photo or whether it's a Google. Photo. Emerson thank you. Thank you very much. Oops accidentally zooming in again. So for things to look shiny and reflective I found that you need to go pretty bold with the. Contrast higher contrast is going to. Make them more shiny, so for the water here, we can. Choose a nice bright color for this. Highlight. Do you put your work or sell it anywhere? I do have an imprint? Um store there should be. I don't know if there's a link on maybe hands links to basically everything of mine is. On my discord. I don't know art Finder. Is that something that you recommend? So there's some little. Reeds and things on the side here. And I wonder if I should try to paint them in or if it's going to get too detailed. But basically there's a mix of. Some warm and cool things. OK, yeah, I haven't heard of it before Roma. When did I start this painting I've been working on it for about? An hour and 15 minutes or something like that. If anybody is coming in and you would like to see the painting from the beginning, you can always watch later after the stream is. Done and after the videos processed it will save all the. It will save the past stream on my profile and you can watch it later if you like. Yeah, I want to give a little bit of texture to the foreground just some hints of grasses and things. I think this kind of brush is cool for you know just giving a little bit of. Some layering some textures have been different. Today it was something a little bit different usually come. I spend more time. On one painting during a stream. But today, I wanted to try focusing on doing some quick studies and focusing on. Textures and It's been really fun. I enjoyed this was a fun painting day. Maybe we can do this again. Or maybe will do some more working to a little bit more polished point with the artwork. Variety is good so. Will do some different things. I would like to work, a little bit more on this one, but I'm getting close to the amount of time that I have. Available today for. First, Dream. Mind showing the other ones you've done, yeah, sure no problem. You see this, this scoops. Save this and this was the 2nd one. And this one was in Spain. And this one was the first one location was in Japan, so lots of different moods. Kind of the same idea mainly natural places with a lot of foliage. A couple with pathways. Yeah, I love painting plants and foliage and I've been really wanting to work on textures for keeping a little bit. Keeping a little bit more loose when painting them 'cause. Of course, you can't get in there and paint every leaf you know. Well, you can, but you know it's going to take a long time. So, sometimes it's good for that level of Polish, but other times, you just kind of want to. Hint that things. Thank you. Thank you Jack Harrer. Do you have? Printed like romance or have I printed my artworks. I have nots? I don't really have a lot of my artwork up at home. I have a couple of my original. I think you know artworks. And I don't print my own work for selling or anything. I tried that in the past along time ago and it's very high maintenance. Printing your own work is really hard to do you know dealing with all the calibration and everything so? I prefer not to. Thank you Molly thank you. When you're finished painting do you use some Photoshop effect sometimes? Yeah, I'm not quite finished with this painting? Yet so. I don't really want to do that, but I didn't get a chance to do, finishing effects on this painting. Earlier, I kind of just ended it and moved on. So I could use this one really quick and show you like some finishing a effects that I might do. This one is not going to make it, it's not going to make it far enough. Um. But yeah, that's a good question. and I don't do a lot, but I'll show you real quick. Um. And, Marty. Thank you so much for the nice comments, which are my most proud of today, Oh Oh. I'm actually pretty happy with how the paintings turned out today, which is nice 'cause you know. You always feel that way I don't always feel that way. But. I kind of. This one's not finished so I feel like it's a little unfair. Um. I don't know I think maybe this one. I'm not sure I can feel equally about them. There's there's neither of them are perfect. That's the thing I don't think either of them are like. I could I could about. And that's with a couple more things on both of them. But I'm still happy specially in amount of time, we spent I'm happy about it. But really quick, I'll show you guys, some finishing things that I do. Thank you. Emily thank you. Yeah, I'll close this and then that will be yeah. That'll be the end. So uhm some things that I like to do or mess with the adjustment layers. I'm just going to move this out here, so you can. See what I'm doing. So I will be a couple of things, so first I generally make a new layer I take the. Airbrush and I often make a little like big net kind of effect. Around the outside. With the airbrush. And you know, I'll choose different colors, depending on what's going on the painting. I usually try to go further warm color, but it can change can vary. And I lower the Opacity. It's really something that you don't want to. You don't want to really notice that it's there. It's supposed to be like. If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't really notice it, but it just kind of lightly urges the viewer to like. Now that leads your eye more in towards the center of the composition. I think it leads right away from edges by darkening them slightly you know. So I'll do something like that. I also like to sometimes go through adjustment layers things like color balance. Um mostly I do these things, especially if I feel like there's something a little off or not quite right with the with the colors and I want to fix it. But even if they do look good, sometimes I go through and just want to like let's let's play. Go to The Shadows Midtones and highlights on the colour balance, sliders and just like look? How much you can change the mood with this kind of stuff. Like sometimes it's fun to just see like. You can really push the mood further or completely change it. Sometimes it can be a little intimidating because of just how much you can change with these. But. Yeah, you can really. Yeah, then you can turn the layer on and off and see. Do you like that? Is there is improvement? Is it said not he decide if you want it you can also go to? We just met layers for levels. Things like that. Brighten things up go a little bit more contrast. Basically, things that I use here are levels curves. Color balance, I like selective color. So, sometimes, I will use that if there's especially if there's one color that I'm not sure if it's really working well. Or like for example, the greens here, I can go to greens and say like. Do we want to make them a lot more yellow? Do we want them to look more. Natural or do we want more blue in the green. Like you can mess with so much. And sometimes it really helps sometimes you don't realize that something is a little off, and when you go into these settings. You can improve stuff that you don't even. No needed improvement, so I like to look just. Turn little visibility on and off and see the changes. The last thing is that I'll do is make a new layer above everything once I know that I like it. And the new blank layer and I'll go to image apply image. So then I have like a merged version of? Everything below the Final layer. Hey shadow craft. Welcome. Jackson says I painted along with the last one, I might finish it later. Let's see anyone else who painted along. You're welcome to share your work in the chat. Cool, Oh my gosh, it's so interesting to see the. That's tiles from the first painting with the no texture to this, I love. I love the textures. That's awesome work, Jackson. I think he did a really nice job with the Sky. I find I found this guy really difficult. Especially in the beginning when I was working on this one. But I think the opening to the Blue Sky looks really good and really believable. Really, nice, yeah, I hope you finish it. If you have time I would like to see that. Um. Yeah, so as far as finishing effects. I like to create a new layer that's merged on Top of everything below and um. Some filters that I like. Would be sharp and you can also use the unsharp mask for some additional options. But usually if I'm just doing a quick study and I'm just want to post it real quick. On social media somewhere, I'll just go to filter sharpen and that's usually enough for me or sharpen more if you really want that but. It's nice how much the sharpen filter makes these digital brushstrokes stand out. I mean, I know we're really zoomed in here, but look at that. It looks so much more like a traditional painting brush stroke with just a little bit of sharpening. Yeah, it's It's nice to see and then another thing is sometimes I'll add a little bit of a noise filter. It's just yeah, it's an effect that can get overdone, but a certain amount of it can be nice to like unify everything in the painting, especially if you have some brushes that have a noisy. Texture another brushes that don't and it's not jiving. We can do that. So that is some of the finishing affect things that I like to do. Um. He. Nice. Yeah, OK, so for anyone just getting here. Sure, I can or returning. I can show you guys what happened today in the stream 'cause we're. Just about to wrap up but the first painting of the day was this one here. And the second one was the cloudy day one that I was just showing here. And then the last one which is not 100% finished, but I'm a little bit out of time for the day, it's. It's almost done, I would like to add some more detail in the foliage in the foreground and this tree. More openings and patches to show the Sky shining through that would be something nice but. Yeah, it was a really good day, I will probably post these not immediately but usually I post them like. At some point over the next week after completing them on Instagram and I also post. My favorite ones. I'll post here on Behance, but I usually like to try to save the nicer ones. That I feel came out really good. So uhm, yeah, you can check that out, if you want and I will be here again at the same time. Next Wednesday, so that was we started about 4 hours ago, yeah about 4 hours ago. Uhm so yeah, will do the same thing next week and you are always welcome to join me with the studies. I hope you do. I really enjoy seeing your paintings so.", "duration": 8334.340000000002, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url":

Good afternoon, good evening whatever time it is for you. Thanks for being here. Hi Fernando Allison, Welcome. I hope you've had a good day so far. I hope you've all been well. If I haven't seen you since last week, I hope you had a good weekend. We're going to be doing some digital painting today. As usual, I'm going to be working from this photo as a reference. I think it's really beautiful. It's like a little cafe table in Spain, with some dappled lighting coming through these trees. I really like the pattern of light on the building over here, and the just overall feeling the different colors. the Blues and pinks and yellows on the wall here. It's really, really cheerful scene. Hi Mohammed, high pro, how are you? I hope you're all doing well. If you guys are interested in painting along with me or doing a little sketch or whatever, you have time for your always welcome to my reference. Image is below in the stream description and above the chat. Also, if you check the info panel it should be there as well so this photo is from Unsplash. You can find a link to the original post from the photographer below. The stream. I'm doing pretty good pro to be honest. I have a little bit of a sore throat, so today's stream might be a tiny bit shorter than some of the others. It's still going to be around 3 hours minimum. Is what I have planned to work on this if I'm feeling good, we might go on or do another painting, but I'm drinking some tea with honey and I have to kind of be careful with my voice a little bit talking so much, but I'm otherwise I'm good. Um prob hey welcome Hi Kumar. So again, that's where you can find my references below in the stream description. You guys are welcome to paint along if you're interested in doing that. Otherwise, just sit back and relax and enjoy the painting. I'll try to do a nice job with this one. I hope it's going to be good. I really like the reference so. Hi Dante. So I'm going to explain my painting process as we go through here. And if you guys have any questions you can let me know. I am using pure ref to put the little reference image up here so we can see a thumbnail view of it while we're painting. My canvas sizes 3000 by 2000 pixels. If you're curious. Yes, I'm using a different Cup today. This is my Starbucks Florida Cup. Maybe more information than you need, but yeah, so I'm I grew up in Florida. I've lived in a few different states, but where I spent most of my life was in Florida so. I don't live there now. I live in the Netherlands so I have this Cup as like little reminder of my past home. All thank you Susan, I really appreciate that I'm I'm trying to fight it of.- High AC, good to see you again. Alright, let's get started with the painting. I'm a little nervous about this one in the sense that it's a complicated one with perspective and a lot going on, but it's a really, really pretty scene, so I hope it's going to be fun regardless of the challenge. I want to pick a color to use as like a background underpainting because I think that would be nice. It's a little bit of a sort of traditional art method, but I think would work well in this scene, so I'm going to pick a color that's close to what a lot of traditional artists would use as a like a burnt Sienna underpainting in their work so. My goal with my digital paintings, especially lately I've explored different styles overtime, but especially lately I'm interested in creating paintings that feel like more like traditional paintings, so I like to use some traditional techniques in my digital work. So for this one, I think it might be fun to try a slightly different approach. I hope it's going to be interesting to watch instead of making a detailed sketch ahead of time, I'm going to try to. Work in shapes, so I'm going to try to block this in and shapes and I'm not going to do a sketch so wish me luck. I think I'm gonna need it. Thank you pro, uh, we're going to try to just work in shapes so there's a couple of ways to do this to get nice, clean sharp shapes. One thing you can do is use the lasso tool. This is super super handy for this kind of thing, so for example. I can take the Polygon lasso tool and make a big selection of this whole back wall. So now that selected, I can use whatever brush I want within their an. Obviously it's only going to let me paint within the selection so I can start blocking in some color back there. Hey Emily, how are you good to see you? And we I'm trying something new here so we'll see how it's going to go. I'm going to try without a sketch for this one, so when I do traditional gouache painting I don't usually sketch on my paper before I start painting. I do often usually make a separate set a sketch on a separate piece of paper just to think through the composition a little bit. So anyway. Long story short. In traditional, I feel more comfortable going in without a sketch. I'm trying to kind of embrace that a little bit in my digital here and see how it goes. So I'm trying to keep my brush pretty big 'cause I don't want to get into any details yet. I want to look at the big picture and just block in big patches of color so. If I don't pick the right color the first time, no problem. Maybe it'll just be like a happy little accident. It will make things more interesting, so will just paint over it. I'm going to try to take the approach of painting over mistakes as much as possible rather than erasing them out. I mean, I still might do little control Z here in there. To get a nice fresh align like this, sometimes you just want to get that one perfect brush stroke. But my point is, when it comes to painting over colors, maybe if I chose the wrong color, I'm going to try to stick to painting over rather than like erasing out. For example, 'cause that might help give a more traditional kind of feeling to this with layers of different color. So. One of the downsides to this kind of style is at the early stages of the painting. Can be very messy and abstract, which isn't necessarily inherently a problem, but it could be a little discouraging. If you are having a hard time visualizing where this is going to go from here to the end, sometimes it can be a little discouraging to see it at this stage 'cause it's confusing, but we're going to get there going to get there, so. Trying to stick to big big big shapes, big patches of color. It's almost like I'm looking at the reference as if it's. As if I had took off my glasses and it's just slightly blurry, so that's kind of how I'm trying to visualize this. So there's one wall down and going to deselect and then make a new selection of the left back wall. So now I've selected that. And I'm going to begin with the yellow is trying to find the right color. Go a little bit darker at the bottom. That's not it. Little warmer, maybe loops. Hope you're all doing well. Those of you who are just getting here as usual, you can always find my references linked below if you're interested in doing a little painting of this one with me, I'd definitely be curious to see how we might have some different interpretations of this one. Hi hanji, lickin well waiting on hold to try and get some better broadband. Oh OK. Good idea. That will definitely help with the whole streaming thing. Well good luck hanji. Hey red, it's really good to see you. Well, welcome. Welcome welcome. Abdul Rahman Hi. Welcome how are you? Hope you're doing good. OK, so now we have very very roughly the back wall and the side wall, and I know that there's some perspective issues here. I think already. I'm not going to Obsess. We're going to keep it loose, so let's go to the next stage. Will be able to fix things as we go. Test my connection was so bad. How are you today? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Thanks for the most part. I have a little little tiny bit of a sore throat so I drinking tea and yeah, hopefully will see I'm gonna do one painting today and we'll see if I can do more. I might have to kind of have this be a little bit of a shorter stream, but I'm trying not to get sick. I don't want to get sick. Hi PC and I hope you don't mind if I abbreviate your name. Good to see you. Thanks for coming over here. Play Nori in the world, the wisps. Oh, enjoy today's the day right. It just came out today. If I'm remembering, right. Oh my gosh, I cannot wait. Hey, if you. I don't want to interrupt your playthrough, enjoy yourself, but if you do see any good screenshots and if you take any good screenshots, maybe we'll end up painting one of them. I know the game is super beautiful. Enjoy. Enjoy, enjoy. I really like this blue bounce light on the ground. You guys see that there's a really, really cool effects on the ground here. Hide Rado. Thank you Hun. Gee, I notice that. If I'm not streaming, tends to be rough on your voice a little bit with a lot of talking. Hey Stephanie, it's more to la welcome, but an awesome reference. Thank you. You know I have such a weakness for this lighting. I'll show it up close real quick for you guys. So pretty such a beautiful mood, the dappled lighting makes me happy, so I'm trying to take a loose, painterly, traditional painting kind of approach here. So that is what we're starting with. And just trying to block in colors. And get get something started. I didn't make a sketch for this, so that's another experiment I usually do. But yeah, I felt like trying something new today. Thank you Emily. Yeah I will. I will try to be in tune with how I'm feeling and play if I actually need to. Will take a break, I promise. It's me, know hers. I remember I remember. I'll try to think about it. I promise if you wanna play the game Maddie and everyone else, it's mostly free. It's an Xbox game pass on only one euro for three months, so that is a very good deal. Yeah, it is very handy. This technique with using the lasso tool you can. Yeah, as you said in chat, there's there's a good you can use it for. Perspective and blocking off areas. If you're if you need to, if you want to paint something a little bit more with hard edges, it's very, very handy for that. So now I'm going to merge them together, so I kept the layers separate while it was beginning, but now I'm OK with them being together. So merge everything. For me, doing a lot of merging just helps me to commit to my decisions as I paint, and when I do painting where I try to get a little bit more of a traditional feeling, I tend to merge more often for that reason. Wonderful color, thank you. It's such a pretty image with beautiful happy colors. OK, so I want to try so one thing that I'm going to try to make this a little bit less intimidating because I think this reference could be a little bit intimidating. There's just so much going on I'm going to try to work from big to small. Hey Jackson, thank you. I you know I will just you know, I love this kind of scene. I'm trying it with no sketch. We're going to try as if it was gouache painting. For me. So I'm working big to small, so I'm going to be blocking in areas based on. That's principle, so just getting this window in here 'cause it's a pretty big shape in the background. And what are the next biggest things? I'm starting to think that I need to do trees next. Um abdulrahman hello again. How are you? I see a big Terra cotta type. Color back here. I think it's part of the wall. I think it's actually on the wall. I thought at first it was like a plant pot, but it's I think it's actually a pattern on the wall. I'm trying not to zoom in very much on my reference, so as a result sometimes it's actually a little bit hard to tell what I'm looking at, but the point is, I don't want to get too sucked into details. It shouldn't really matter what exactly I'm looking at. The idea is I should be able to look at overall the shape of the object and paint it in just fine even without knowing what it is I should be able to see the shape and recreate something that. Makes sense. So that's what I'm trying to do. So now over here on the right we have some other windows and doors and things, so if we're going to simplify it to me, what I end up seeing is a lot of vertical stripes. You know, it's not necessarily that we can tell every exact detail of what's happening with every Doran, what exactly? Exact pattern of the architecture, but I think it's important just to get this striping effect of the doors and Windows first and then we can get more and more precise with like which windows have little bars and gates and things like that. But for now I'm just going to start with. Where do I see the big vertical stripes? Roughly. And there might be mistakes here. Oh, thank you, I see, thank you. That's very nice of you. I appreciate it. Yeah, you can download you guys. Can download some of my brushes below the stream in the description if you're interested. Some of the brushes that I'm using today are custom ones that I'm working on creating for future set that will be available so not all the brushes that I'm using are available now, but a lot of them are. So if you want to grab those you can. If you're looking for some brushes that have. Painterly, kind of feeling. One of my favorite places in the picture is this really really bright area on the wall over here on the right. It's so beautiful right around the window. This really, really bright Patch and then all the little. Patches of leaves. Oh, you're hear all your Disney Princess Hair looks amazing. You're so sweet. Thank you. I'll, I'll take it, thank you, that's very sweet. I'm happy my hair is getting a little bit longer. Finally, feels like it's taking awhile. I know realistically it's going pretty fast, but. I want it to be long again. So I'm just painting in the big shape of this splash of light around the window. I'm not getting into every individual little leaf shape that appears there that's going to come in the future, but right now we're just doing. We're just doing the big big shape. Chazzan loading properly, uh, no, I can't see any updated message and mine either. At least I know you can read them. That's so funny so you can hear me respond to you so you know I can see your message. I wonder what's happening I'm sure you already tried refreshing so I'm not sure. If you want, you could take a screenshot for me late for later I could. Send the info to be hands and let them know that there was an issue. But I don't know if the screenshot will show anything. If it's basically a blank chat, what you're seeing then? That's not, then there's not much to see. Thank you Mohammed. Thank you. I so love the late on that wall. Me too me too. I'm excited to get into all the little details of it. I have to kind of use my self control to not go now and start painting all the little leaves and stuff. Yet I want to make sure that I at least get up. You know more things in the center of the image is a lot more. I need to do before I indulge in all the little leaf painting. I totally agree with you. And the light comes all the way back up here. This kind of image, it just makes me want to go on vacation. That makes me want it to be summer vacation. Having little drink at this cafe. Painting seems like this. I find very relaxing. New coffee us. It's actually not that new, but I don't use it as often as my Penguin one, but that would need to be washed. So instead we're in tropical Florida today. I guess this fits the mood, doesn't it? Ohmygosh it has the same colors as my painting that wasn't even on purpose, but I'll take it. Oh, thank you. I hope you enjoy the brushes. There is one in there right now. The one of the brushes in that brush site is called rectangular texture. It's a good one to use for stuff like this. Rock, sandstone walls and different things. Different things of that nature. Hi Ryan Maybe someday Disney will produce a story about an art Princess gliding through the Internet, building out. I feasts of art to the masses. Hey Ryan, get to see you. Hey I would watch that. I would watch that. Ryan, I'm taking a gouache approach to this one. That's the idea. Will see how it's going to work. But I'm trying to treat this more like my gouache painting. You guys, it's so silly, but I often think to myself, why do I get these certain results in my? traditional painting. I want to get these types of results in my digital painting it. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is. I have big differences in my workflow between traditional and digital, and I think that's part of what causes a difference in style. So I'm going to try painting this as if I was painting it in Gouache and see what happens because I think that will change the results. Be hands on Mobile is not working as good as desktop. My videos constantly black and I only get the audio. The good part is I still get to hear Maddie's lovely voice. Well, thank you, but I'm sorry to hear that that's happening. Must be where I live. I. Alright, Thanks for the feedback you guys. So are you also on the Mobil One? I guess so Jackson. I can let them know that that's having some problems. Thanks Ryan. Ha ha. This blue is just magic. OK, so we have one door here. And then a couple. I believe windows we're going to be adding a bunch of. I'm really trying not to get too. Is that too much detail? I'm really trying to stick with. Big stripes of color right now. Until we go into the next phase. Kind of hard for me to avoid going in. Start painting little little tiny things. I think I went a bit too high with this door that doesn't. Seem. Seem right, they might have different Heights and things, but we don't need Giants living here. I'm on both. IPad to see you and PC for the invisible chat. Oh my thank you, you guys. Thank you for your dedication. Thank you for being here. Despite the tech some tech difficulties. I'm glad you're here. And painting along. Yes, enjoy, hey, if you guys are painting along happy painting, I hope you enjoy this one. I'm going to try to make a new layer every so often so that we can kind of see the progress of this. Maybe I do need to make those little higher. I just want all the doors in a row to seem. That there. In proportion coming towards us. OK. Cool. So let's get some windows up here. Looks like such a nice place to have a coffee and do some sketching. Today my couch potato dumpling. I'm moving into the customer support helps me with my tablet. Oh, I hope you're able to get it resolved really quickly. Having problems with your. Tablet is the worst. It's really the worst. Kind of stuck not being able to do any any art and you work. Great idea to try and copy your same painting method. That should really help and in a way it helps us learn both traditional and digital. That's cool. Yeah, it's true. It's true. You can apply a lot of the same well. Of course the fundamental things are the same. Like you know, composition rules and all those things those are going to be the same no matter your medium, but I find that. Yeah, I take such a different approach. With traditional and then I and then I wonder why does it look different? So there should be something interesting. Thank you. Ha, thank you bro. That's sweet of you. I think painting older buildings, buildings with more character, historical buildings and those types of places are really, really enjoyable because they have a lot of charm. And they also for me are little less stressful to paint rather than modern skyscraper or something that's very very. Clean and geometrical and you know the perspective needs to be really, really perfect to kind of sell it. I think it's nice to do. Older buildings, buildings with a lot of character and buildings that if you make a little bit of a miss mark here or there. Or a little bit of a mistake with some of the perspective. It's not so noticeable. It's a if anybody's looking into wanting to get into painting more buildings and scenery and stuff. I always recommend starting well. First starting with landscapes that are like just in a natural setting, so maybe without buildings or cars or things like that and just organic shapes, I think those are the most friendly at the beginning. This is just kind of from my personal experience. If you find a different thing works for you, that's always fine, of course, but. I find that going with natural subjects is easier at first because tree shapes you know all those things they can be there can be such a big variety in our brains don't really mind if a tree has a little bit of a weird shape to it or something we're used to seeing those kind of things in nature. But it's a little bit more obvious with buildings and cars. If something's not right. Emily says I was watching a video on how to make your paintings look more traditional, and they suggested painting in one layer, not using undo button like you would in traditional basically. Yeah, I think that's a good tip. I think that's a good tip for me. I don't. Necessarily feel the need to be like super super strict with those rules, but I am kind of taking a little bit of that idea with what I'm doing here. I'm just not being like. Overly strict with it. I do think that it's nice to be able to use your digital tools for the advantages they give you and sometimes. In some situations I feel like it's really handy to be able to make that perfect brushstroke. Sometimes in Gouache I really miss being able to have a second try at something. So in that case, sometimes I will use undo still, but I'm I'm trying to take that advice in a general sense and. Not use it excessively and to choose to paint over. It's a really difficult habit to break. That's the main problem. It's not that I'm so against it, it's just that my I'm so used to using these keyboard shortcuts. It's so difficult. I press them without thinking. It's almost autopilot, but one thing that I do, I do try to have the mindset of painting on one layer. I'm actually using multiple layers because I like to be able to look back and see the steps, but I'm painting right now, like right on the layer of my painting. And I'll probably duplicate this layer in a few minutes and. You know, just have it for my records. Go on to the next layer. So I yeah, I think that's a really good tip. Always said painting either on one layer or even if you're using multiple layers. Kind of pretending that you're on one layer. And when I say pretending you're on one layer, what I mean is, for example, if I'm going to make a new layer here, I can start painting now, but without changing the way that I'm painting at all, just painting freely like I would normally. But technically my layers above here. That way you can still kind of look. You can still kind of turn the layer on and off and check and see if everything is going well before it's officially merged down until you're painting, but you get the stylized stylization benefit of having painted everything. In one, like in one layer, I think you still get the same benefits from that. Personally, as long as your. Kind of, I think is a mindset thing there. Can I share my window please? OK, honey says our provider has an offer on. We have been with them so long. We can upgrade to ultrafast broadband. Whoa for less money. Yeah. Oh man Hunji Congratz That's so awesome. Let's see you. You definitely have to celebrate those wins when they happen. That's great. That's really great. OK, so I'm going to do a little bit of editing of my work here. I'm going to make a selection of this area on the right. This these this window let me go to layer new layer via copy or control J so I have this on its own layer now. Go to edit transform perspective. I think I'd like to make this bigger. An apply more perspective to it, I just don't feel like. I'm really selling the perspective on that. Wall, so I'm using a bunch of transform tools to try to. That doesn't look right either. It's definitely a bit wonky. It's definitely bit wonky at the moment. I'm going to move it over. Make it bigger and I think that little. I think this is the main problem here. So before we get too far along. I can ask him to confirm like five times he like. It's too good to be true. For me it's like a nature to use my thumb to undo even when I'm using a normal keyboard. My thumb still thinks it. Anything that can reach it undo. Yeah, I definitely get that feeling my. Keyboard shortcuts are just so ingrained that I have a really hard time to try any of those challenges where you're not supposed to use a certain thing, like undo or something like that. I have a really hard time sticking to the challenge because my fingers are just pressing those keys without even thinking. I would have to disable the shortcut if I really wanted to not use it. Hi Monir, welcome. Reads as I try to screenshot from the game I hope you don't mind 'cause I can't remove it. Posted on the discord. Oh, let me see. Boo. The lighting is so pretty in this game. This is a screenshot red took in the ori and the blind forest which just came out. It might be fun to do. Some painting from this game. Beautiful glowy lights and things. All that's very kind of you to be looking out for taking spoiler free. Screenshots, that's very sweet of you. Yeah, I think a lot of people are going to play that one, so it's nice to consider. So I'm going to flip my canvas and I'm going to flip my reference. This is hopefully going to help me take a fresh look at what I'm doing here and maybe make some adjustments. If you guys ever start to feel really lost in your painting and you can't. Figure out what's wrong, but maybe something is bugging you. It really helps to flip your canvas horizontally. Then you will kind of trick your brain into. Reprocessing the image. So you're going to see it fresh in a new way. Sometimes after we've been looking at something for awhile, it's hard to. It's hard to really tell what's going on there. Some things that. You think? We're working. There might be something off with it and you just can't see it anymore. So yeah, flipping the image can be really, really handy. So I'm going to put in tiny bit of these little dashboard lights just so we can figure we can start to think about. The lighting scenario there, but I definitely want to do more later. Yeah, season it exactly right. Not knowing the keyboard shortcuts, would it actually be a benefit in this case? Because if you were trying to paint traditionally so that way you wouldn't be going on autopilot and clicking away. It's so hard to turn that of.-. OK, so I think this is time for me to make a new layer because I want to be able to look back at this process and I think if we don't make a new layer now then we're going to end up having one of those tutorials where you have like one step and then it's like finished in the next step and you're like, wait is like it was. I supposed to see anything in between there. So OK will save now will keep going. From here. And for me, I also find that it's nice to kind of work around the painting and not spend two too much time in one spot. So I'm going to try to rap things up with this pink wall over here is getting a lot more attention than the rest of the scene right now, and it is closest to us, so I think it's it's alright to focus in a little bit, but I don't want to get too stuck when we have other areas of the painting that still need. Our attention quite a lot might be time to flip again to go back to our original. Oh, the start to finish hashtag yes, although I am really enjoying that hashtag, I have to admit I've there have been a bunch of artists that I found through that that I didn't know before. Like I'm seeing some amazing art because of it. Like a lot of those trends kind of introduce you to new artists, the. What was the other recent ones? The tune me and all those little things that go around, but this one more than any other one has found like really amazing artists because of it. Just kind of showing up on my timeline on Twitter, so I'm happy. But yeah, it's definitely like the most extreme case of of that. With that classic. Rest of the owl tutorial. Super interesting to follow, but it's truly not educational. Yeah, it's just. It's only for me. It's just pure eye candy. Seem like these beautiful artworks, but it's definitely not. We need a little bit. We need a few more steps in there to really learn something. Something. One thing that it does show is just that a lot of beautiful, beautiful artworks of humble beginnings, which can be an encouraging thing. To see. OK. I will move along back to. This wall over here and I don't necessarily like what I did with this shadow in the center, so I'm going to take that away. Will try again. So new layer. There's a few. Interesting shadows here of. Little balconies that extend out from the wall. So I I do kind of want to at least start getting some of these shadows in. But I'm not sure exactly. Uh. What's the best way to simplify these shapes? I want to give for the viewer the impression. Of what's here, but without so specifically, drawing every little detail of it. So I'm trying to figure out how to do that with shapes, blocks of color. Just kind of putting the right shapes roughly in the right place. About a ton of precision of the detail, I think we can still give the idea. OK, up here the. The blue. Wall has a light shining on it too, so we've got really bright white and then coming up right next to it on the left. We've got the. The yellow, so it's. Nice contrast. I'm looking forward to painting in the. Plants. I think that would be my next thing. I might pop in a little bit more of this, warm, almost hot orange color. I really, really like it. Anubhav, hi welcome. For you. So it might be good to turn my painting into black-and-white, turn the reference into black and white, and have a look. This definitely helps. Look at that. I mean my painting is in the early stages, but we really get a feeling of what's missing. So as the scene gets further away from us, this whole area is quite a bit darker. The trees are darker, but this whole area is more in Shadow and then over here, generally lighter. So we need to boost up the lighting in the area closer to us. An overall dark in the area down further. Hey, I'm above I. Sadly I don't know how to do that, um. I do have an artist that I know who does that type of Art. I wonder if I can find. Them really quick. To give you a recommendation, 'cause I think he has some videos on YouTube. I don't do movie posters but give me 1 second. Let me see if I can find the artist name to recommend to you who might be able to give you some good. Good info on that. Trying to remember their account off the top of my head. Alright, hold on I think I got it. Yeah, he's really good. Let me give you a link. He only has a couple YouTube videos. I thought he had more. I know this artist from Instagram. I'm still going to post the link in the chat. Um? I'll post the link to his. Instagram too, I'm really amazed by his work. He does photo bashing. Um? Photo bashing multiple images together to create things that would definitely appear to be movie poster type of artwork. And he's a lot of his Instagram posts show behind the scenes and process things and stuff like that. So process and a lot of these are movie poster style artworks. And for a lot of them you can see the behind the scenes like the pieces that came together. To create the image. So I hope it helps a little bit. Sorry, I don't know more about it myself. How many hours a day to practice to keep your skills sharp? Well for me it I stream four days a week. I stream here and be hands on Wednesdays, but I also stream on Twitch on some other days so. I street, so I'm doing are at least four days a week minimum. And I like to do it more, but it depends from week to week if I'm busy with other things because I also have other aspects of my business that I have to do that aren't. I'm not actually creating art, but rather like packing and shipping things and doing little things like that so I'm not able to make art every day even though I would love to paint every day. Some days I don't. Um? But yeah, it's a minimum of four and as much as Seven that happens on occasion where I draw everyday. But how many hours a day when I stream, it's generally between. Four and Seven hours. A stream on non stream days. I might paint a couple hours. Hi, some earth welcome. Alright, let me check this out. New BOF. Do poster work here and be hands also. Cool stuff. I like this one. This one looks definitely looks like a movie poster. I wanted to know how to monetize our passion and create income as a designer. Well, there's a lot of different ways to go about that. You can take commissions, Commission work from clients. That's one way to make money as an artist and creator. You can create. Tutorials sharing your process and sell the tutorials. You can make prints of your work depending on what kind of Art you make. I know this might be a little bit different in design, I'm not sure. It kind of depends, but some art styles work very well for prints and artwork that people like to hang on their walls so. You know making your prints prints available is something you can do. People come up with a lot of unique, niche ways of making a living as an artist. I've noticed different kinds of merchandise and different things. I guess one thing to do is keep an open mind. There might be something that you think of doing that doesn't even exist yet. There's a little bit of a good drain pipe that comes down over here. So if anybody is just arriving at the stream, I want to let you know what we're up to. I'm doing a study of the photo that you see above here at a small size. An I'm trying to take a traditional painting approach to it, even though I'm using photo shop. Using some textured brushes and trying to think about this as if it was traditional paint and I'm hoping that that's going to give a certain type of feeling through the work. But it's a little bit of an experiment. But if you guys would like to join me, all the studies that I do here on be hands every Wednesday when I stream here I always share my reference image. So if you are interested in joining me with a little painting or sketch or whatever, you have time time for you can grab the reference image. It's below the stream in the description panel and it's also in the info and info panel above the chat, so that's where you can find the reference and. You're welcome to paint or sketch along, and you can always share what you do with the image in the chat. Would be interested to see. There's usually a few people painting along, and it's fun to see what different artstyle interpretations are. Oh, thank you. Sure, I'll post my Instagram in the chat. Thanks for asking. So I actually have two Instagram accounts. Sorry for being complicated, it's up to you which one you'd like to follow. I have one for my traditional art and one for my digital art. I assume you guys are probably. Maybe more interested in digital arts. Because you're watching digital art stream, but a lot of artists are into both. So if you want to check out my. If you want to check out my traditional paintings, I'm going to also post that one next and you can. Check it out if you're interested. OK, I'm going to flip my reference up here too. I finished my Witcher scene from yesterday. Nice, I didn't get a chance to finish mine yet, but I'm definitely going to. I actually wanted to work on it this morning, but I had a huge glare. Look at these windows. I had a huge glare on my monitor this morning. Early in the day. It's really hard for me to do digital art. I would need to move my. I would need to move my angle of my desk, but basically I wanted to work on my painting and I couldn't even do it because of this huge glare. So anyway, if you want to share it, you're welcome to. I would love to. I would love to see it. Thank you bro. Sisanda high. Yeah, 100 mils couldn't make it today. He's OK but. Something came up. He might not be at streams for a few days. For some IRL things. But he's OK. Alright, so I'm just going to do a little bit more, will little bit more work on the windows. And then I will be. Putting in some plants finally, which I'm super excited about. OK, so up to this point, I've been taking a very traditional approach to this painting. I haven't been using a lot of layer blending modes or anything. I've been sticking mostly to just a normal layer and painting on there with my paintbrush, but. Earlier when we did a little bit of a value check, I noticed that my painting it wasn't nearly dark enough in a distance and it still has that problem. 'cause I haven't really addressed it yet, so I'm going to show you some ways of fixing this problem and I hope it might be interesting. So OK, if I turn my painting into black and white and the reference into black-and-white, you'll see my issue. I think. Do you see how the foreground in my painting the area closer to us, closer to the table in the windows? Needs to be brighter and then the further area with the trees and everything will. The trees aren't there yet, but that area needs to be darker so we've already painted quite a bit of stuff. So I want to try to edit what I have there a little bit rather than like painting over everything completely. So we can do some layer blending modes for that before we go into that, I just want to show you really quick how I turned my painting into black and white. In case you don't know how to do that, there's a couple of ways you can do it, and it's really helpful for being able to see if your painting is going well with the shading, the darks and lights to see if the values are going well, because sometimes when you have all these bright colors it's hard to get a grip on the shading. It can create some weird optical illusions and it's hard to tell, so if you go to view proof setup custom. You want to set the device to simulate to working Gray dot gain 20%, so this is not something that's automatically set up in your photo shop, but if you follow the directions that I'm showing here, if you set it up one time, it's always going to be fine. You're always going to be able to use a shortcut and do this switch quickly to black and white, so you go to view. Proof set up custom and then set the device to simulate to working grade. Gained 20% and then press OK and then every time you go you use uh control Y you will get a black and white version of your painting and the awesome thing about this is you can color pic while it's in this state you can color pic and paint and it's going to be using the real colors of your actual painting but showing you the black and white version. So that's Super Super Handy and I hope you guys might find it useful. Facing some problem in growing my Instagram as an artist. Can you please brief us? Hum. I'm yeah, I'm happy to give advice if I can. The only thing I want to say is I think that sometimes with Instagram and certain social medias. Depending on the type of Art you're making, you might find easier growth on one platform versus another platform, sometimes certain platforms. Have a certain type of content that tends to be like really popular there. So for example, whether you decide to post on different platforms, you might find success in different places. So, but what I've done on Instagram is just, you know. Post pretty frequently if you can, so at some point in time I've been better or worse with this in the past, but post consistently you don't have to post constantly but get on a consistent schedule of some kind. So even if that's once a week, just try to be somewhat consistent so there's like an even amount of space in between your posts. Use hashtags. Post when you post put some information about your content. Don't just post an image with no information because it's less interesting to people. So if it's an artwork, maybe talk about something that was difficult when you made it or something you learned. Or what is your favorite part, or maybe what's your least favorite part or something about the art that might be interesting for people to learn about? I use the hashtags and post multiple images if you can. So maybe post the artwork and then some images of your process that's more interesting to people, and I've heard that the algorithms favor images with multiple. Yeah, multiple images in the image carousel, so not just one would be good and those are some suggestions. What about targeted audience? Wait, what do you mean by that pro? Can you give me some more information? I'm sorry I'm not I do my own marketing as an artist, but I don't maybe know all the terminology and everything like I haven't studied marketing specifically in school or anything. So when you say targeted, targeted audience, I think you're referring to. Are you are you asking me? How do you decide what your target audience is or what exactly are you asking me? In the mean time I will start doing some shading here on the background, so I'm going to make a new layer and I will put my layer on multiply mode, multiply as a layer blending mode. I like to use for shading, it darkens things, but it doesn't completely. It doesn't cover like what it would do if I was using a normal layer, it's still going to show what is below my area that I'm painting, but it's just going to darken it. So I'm going to choose a blue and I might. I might change this color. Yeah, it's not exactly the effect I want. I think I'm going to go. I think I'm going to take a different approach. Multiply, multiply didn't work. OK, so I'm going to make an you. Adjustment layer I think adjustment layer is going to be better, so I'm going to come down here to the half circle icon and let's try levels. So levels is going to affect the darks and lights in my painting. An I can choose to darken. The highlights, midtones and shadows. This is also affecting the contrast, so you just kind of want to take a look and see if it's going well. Definitely a lot more contrasts, but The thing is, I'm only interested in this affecting the further area of my painting really. Uhm, the other thing we could use is curves. Maybe curves is better. Yeah, I think that's better. OK so so here we go. Finally I tried a few different things and I finally have the result that I want. That's pretty common for me sometimes you gotta try different things to see what's going to do what you want. Angie says use relevant hashtags but don't use any with millions of tags. Use hashtags of things you think people might search. Be active and support other artists by liking, commenting, sharing in their stories, etc. Thank you so much, Angie. You're that's really good advice. Yeah, you guys listen. Take countries advice on that. Just totally right. OK, so I'm going to so now what I want to do is block out. Areas that I don't want to be affected by this mask. This adjustment layer that I created, so there's automatically a mask here you can see the rectangle that's. Um, white. If I take a black paint brush using airbrush right now anywhere that I paint with black, it's going to basically bring back the layer below. That was lighter. So anywhere that I want it to be later, all I have to do is paint with black onto this mask and then anywhere that I want to stay dark, I just. Leave it alone. So I think that's an improvement, so I'm going to merge it down because I don't, you know, the great thing about adjustment layers as you can leave them there, but for my purposes I'm trying to. Yeah, I don't want. I don't need it to stay there. I just wanted to use it to do that darkening effect so. Let's continue. James is, if you haven't already, you can make your account and artist account and you can see insights. The number of impressions on posts and see which hashtags work best. That's a good idea. I did that on one of my accounts and not the other one, and I've been thinking about doing it there too. Yeah, you can see a lot more about. Which posts are successful and kind of what's going on behind the scenes? It'll analytics and things. OK, so I want to start adding in foliage and plants. Thanks Hun Ji. It's good advice. So I think for the first time in this painting, I'm going to switch to a different brush. I'm trying to find something. That would be good for what I want to do next. You may end up just sticking with the same brush. I just want to be good. There's virtually no downside of converting an Instagram account to business. Or is there? I don't think there is a downside. There were rumors that there was a downside that. It was rumored that Instagram doesn't give as good engagement to like. Business accounts as it does to regular account, so I don't know if the artist account would count as that, but. I haven't personally experienced any negatives from switching my one account, so. I might switch to the other one too. Process related to an above question about growing Instagram artists account, so I say that what is target audience in related field? I don't understand. I'm sorry bro. You might just be going over my head like I don't understand the question. I apologize. Just that I'm not sure what you're asking me to answer. What is the targeted audience? Is that what you're asking? I mean, it's good to think about. I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but it is good to think about like who the type of person is that you're trying to reach with your posts, and what they would be interested in, and what hashtags they would use. So if that's what you mean, I agree with that. All right, so we're getting in our first tree shapes finally. I'm probably going to do these on separate layers just so I have the freedom to move them around and really be sure where I'm placing the trees. Once I'm going to one style, you know. Firm that I'm happy with my choice, then I will. Murdered down. He's asking about whom should be target an who will like to see our post. OK, OK? Well. I don't know that I have the answers to that. Of course, that's something that I'm trying to do a good job with as well when I'm posting, but that's a little bit of something that you kind of learn as you go, I think. And it depends on the individual what they're trying to do with their art. Are you trying to create a portfolio that? Yeah, exactly hungry or it will depend on the person and what their goals are with their art, who they're trying to reach? Are they trying to have art directors see their work because they want to get hired for a company? Are they trying to sell their prints to individuals? Then they might be looking at a different demographic of people that are interested in buying decorations for their home. That could be a very wide range of people, so it depends on what you're trying to achieve with your art and whether you're trying to sell something or just. Show off your portfolio for a job. That will really change. Maybe your your audience that your ideal. Audience and I don't know that I can give any specific answer other than you know it's something good to think about an. It might change overtime. But so much of this is trial and error, and it's good to watch videos. There's a lot of YouTube videos about these topics with people that are much more knowledgeable specifically about that than me because I have a relatively small following compared to some of the larger creators with like hundreds of thousands of followers, and you can find videos from those types of creators. On YouTube, maybe they'd have better advice 'cause I'm kind of still on my way trying to also figure out these things. I'm happy to share what I've learned up to this point. Um? Monir says target audience is what type of people do you want to your posts to reach? OK, I understand I understand, thank you. Yeah I get what targeted audience means, but I wasn't understanding his question, but I think I think we got it now. I hope I hope we were able to answer it. Answer it a little bit. I really like these tree shapes. They're fun to make little bends and turns in them. So I have the trees on one layer right now, so I'm going to go back to each tree and give a little bit of more detail to each individual tree while they're on their own layer. I find it easiest to do this. So. While they're on their own layer, I can go in and. Push the lock transparency. Right here. You just press this button. The little checkerboard icon. Now you're able to paint easily within the lines. Be scenes as I think you most mostly need to figure out what you want to do, because if you change in the name of an audience, chances are you will no longer take pleasure in doing it. I think that is good advice in the most important thing is that you're doing what you want to do with your art, an marketing and all that is important too, of course. But I agree that you kind of want to decide what you want to do and then figure out how to market that rather than changing what you're doing to fit in with marketing. OK, let me check it out. Yeah I know what you mean about Instagram is not super landscape painting friendly. Oh, that came out really nice. What a pretty scene. I wish I could make it bigger. Beautiful, the lighting looks great. Strong shapes, I like that you added the butterfly was that there. I don't remember there being a butterfly. Maybe I just missed it but. Very good vibes. Hey Graphics. So I'm going to brighten up the. Tree a little bit. Adding bounces lay on the left and right. Who? So these trees in the back should be a little bit extra dark and then. We can add this medium Brown as a highlight because they're so dark will actually be able to. See that color? Is definitely a challenge organizing the shading this way. If I'm painting with more of a digital type of Workflow. Rather than imitating my traditional painting, I find it's a little easier to paint with gradients and things. Rather than what I'm doing here, but hopefully the extra challenge will be worth it. Hi Christopher, welcome. Welcome, I hope you're having a good day. If you or anyone wants to take a look at the reference image that I'm painting from. You can find it below the stream as usual in the stream description. Season says maybe silly question, but how do you decide on what size to make your artboard when you're starting out? OK, so it's not silly. I'm a little bit all over the place with this, so it kind of depends on the situation. So if I'm making a quick study and it's just going to be something that I show online an I might not ever make a print of it. If I'm pretty sure I'm not going to print it and it's just something that I might post later on Instagram and I'm just doing it for a quick study practice, I'll make the image pretty small. It'll be easier for me to work with. Less lag on your computer. You know it's just easier less. Less problems all around smaller file so I will in that case paint around 2015 hundred pixels. Something like that, but if I feel like it's an image that I really like, even if it's just a study. If I feel like there's any chance that I might want to make a print of it, I will consider making it a little bit bigger from the start, like this one is 2000 by 3000 pixels. It's big enough to make a small print if I end up really liking this one just because I was a big fan of the setting. If I'm painting something that I want to definitely want to print that I'm going to make it much larger from the start. Maybe a minimum of like 5000 by 7000 pixels, and you know I'll be working in 300 DPI from the start. Usually the ones that I'm only ever planning to share on the web, I'll just paint those at 72. Hi Kelly, welcome. Yeah, not a math crunchy 1 honey. I was I was searching and I just didn't find anything that really. It wasn't feeling it, you know? I wanted one with like the just the perfect kind of lighting and I wasn't finding it, so I decided to find one from Unsplash. Alright, we're finally going to add some some trees leaves. Perhaps OK, good. So I'm going to put the color dynamics on my brush so that it's going to give a little bit of huge jitter. It might not be much. But the idea is as I'm painting. It's giving us light striping effect to the brush. It's kind of hard to see, but it is there. Yes, it graphics, so I've so far I painted this whole scene in photo shop from the start. So I didn't begin with a traditional sketch or anything like that. For example, this was all done in photo shop. If you're interested in seeing it from the start later after the stream is over, it's you can always find the replay if you go to my profile here on be hands and go to the videos tab, all of my past livestreams are there, so if there's if you wanted to see it from the start you can find it there. But yes, I'm using photo shop and the whole thing has been done in here so far. I really enjoy painting in Photoshop. OK, so this tree as we're getting closer to us, this tree is going to be. It's actually a little is it a different type of tree? I'll know they're the same, the same type of tree, but the they just this one that's closer to us is getting. Hit by light very brightly so its leaves look more green, more bright green, yellow green color. Even so, it's nice to have a little variation, some medium and dark green deeper in the tree, and then the lights on the outside. Hi Pearl, how long will it take you to finish when painting? By the way, it's very nice. Thank you. It depends on the painting for what the type of thing I'm doing right now. My goal is to spend around 3 hours on this. I started about an hour and. 10 minutes ago. Yeah, so an hour in 10 hour and 15 minutes ago so. I'm hoping in like 2 more hours I can finish the painting now that's not going to be a super super polished detailed painting. It's more of a study an hopefully it's going to look nice at the end still, but it's not going to be like super super polished if I want to Polish a work up then I can take a lot more time on it anywhere from like. Aids 1220 or 30 hours for detailed illustration with characters and things like that in the background, but for something like this, I'm going to try to do it in about 3 hours. We'll see. We'll see how it goes. I'm drinking tea. I'm drinking tea right now. Green tea with honey. So I first painted the. The tree trunks then behind the layer of the tree trunks I painted. The first layer of foliage, but now I'm going to go on top because I want the tree trunks to feel like very covered by the leaves. Thank you thanks Christopher. Well. Thank you, I really like this scene. It's really, really pretty reference, so. There's a lot of things that I like about the lighting, and I hope that I can really make those things pop out in a more dramatic way in my painting by the end. I like both tea and coffee, but I'm drinking. I'm drinking tea. So I really like this blue bounce light that's on the tree back here. I don't know if you guys can see, but what I'm working on right now, it's like. Blue teal color on some of the leaves in the references. Bit small, but. It's really really beautiful effect and. When the leaves aren't getting direct light hitting them, but there's a little bit of light. Light blue bounce light from the Sky or the surroundings bouncing off the leaves so pretty. And then it's nice to kind of contrast that with a more yellow green where the sun is directly hitting. Hi Merlin, I have a Wakeham Centriq 22. So I do have a screen tablet an I'm using the stylus right on the screen so I can see my artwork there. But there's a lot of different types of tablets out there. You certainly don't have to have this exact one. So there's lots of different options, lots more affordable options coming out these days. Which is nice. If you guys are looking for any. Information about purchasing tablets or finding good ones? Stuff like that. There's a link below my stream in the description that's for my resources page. You should be able to find it down their resources and tutorials page that has a bunch of helpful links that I've compiled over the past years that I've been doing digital art. The first section of that page has a link links to different tablet buying guides and reviews and things like that. So if you're looking to get a tablet for the first time, you might want to check that out. If you are kind of just getting into that. Alright, I'm gonna dark in the. Tree branches a little bit, I'm just noticing in the reference these are really dark and almost just the silhouette back here. For your left hand to use the tablet buttons or keyboard or one of the specialized keyboard things, I have always been a fan of just using the regular old keyboard shortcuts, so that's what I'm using. The tablet that I'm using now, they actually they welcome centriq 22 HD used to have buttons on it. Well it still does, but the gnu 22 does not have buttons so my tablet doesn't have any buttons on it. Even if I wanted them. But Luckily I don't. I'm fine with the keyboard, I prefer the keyboard because. It always stays the same and I'm used to it. I don't have to. Worry about it changing. I'm that was one thing I was worried about and getting used to the tablet keys. Sometimes the different changes to the models of the tablets and I was kind of worried about having to relearn my keyboard shortcuts. So I decided to. Stick with the keyboard, but hey, you got to do what's right for you. What feels comfortable, that's super important. You have to be comfortable while you're working, so there's no real right or wrong way to do the keyboard shortcuts. As long as you. Personalize them to yourself. Oh, thank you uninvolved. This very nice of you, thanks. I'm just rearranging my tree is a little bit from the original position. I want. I want this one in the back to be a little bit lower. I think too. I think I could have just lowered all of them. OK, I'm going to merge my trees so now my trees are all on one layer and then I'll just keep painting from here. Hail avenged how's your day going? OK, so a little bit of shadows and deeper part of this tree again to give dimension. So we definitely want some dark green here and then we want to move up into more of a yellow green where the light is hitting. And I'm using a brush that's creating a leaf texture, but I might go on top of this after I let the brush kind of block things in for me and get some of the some of the look of this detail. I'm probably going to go in and do some of my own leaves too. Are using new brush presets. Yeah, I'm using some custom. I'm working on creating a custom brush set so I've made these brushes myself. The ones I'm using right now and I'm kind of testing them out so I can't show these ones yet. There still kind of being tweaked, but I do have a brush that you can download for free below in the description if you're interested. Up to this point of me creating the brush that I'm working on now that was like my main brush set I've been using for the past. I don't know over a year. So there's a lot of good brushes there too, if you are interested in trying them out, but the ones I'm using today will be available in the future. I pay you $1,000,000. Don't worry all they'll be much less expensive than that, but I just need to finish finish them up. Make sure they're all working good and I want to release a brush pack with them so there's a few more that I want to create an include, but it's going well so far. Thank you Ricardo. Welcome back gene. Well, I hope you guys are doing well. Thanks for joining again. But the goal of these brushes that I'm making here are to kind of imitate a little bit more of traditional painting textures. And hopefully just to be fun to use. That's something I really want. I like to make brushes that are like really fun to paint with and not difficult or tricky. 'cause I. I just want to relax, have a more relaxing painting process. Would you like to paint any photo street? I usually like to pick the photos for myself. I have a little bit of certain tastes of what I like to paint, so I usually choose them. If you are a photographer and you like to share your work, if you're interested in joining my discord community, I'll put a link in the chat. For that, there's areas in there that you can share your art, whether your photographer or painter. Whatever you do. If you'd like to share, you can post it in there if you're interested. No pressure, of course. Do you have a YouTube channel? No I don't. I'm sorry about that. I mean I do have a YouTube account. But I don't. I haven't uploaded any videos to the channel. I had a couple on there like years and years ago, but I just don't have time to make videos for YouTube. I do a lot of live streaming if you're interested in seeing any past videos of my streams, like when I'm not live, you can check the. You can check my page and my profile. There's a videos tab and there you can see any past livestreams and you can kind of Fast forward through him to get through parts you're interested in, so that's the best thing I have where you the great thing about watching past streams here on Behance as they have a tool timeline. This is running while I'm streaming so it's capturing information about the tools that I'm using as I'm using them, so if I'm going a little faster if there's something I'm doing you're curious about we can always ask me in the chat, but. You can also watch the stream later. In the replay you'll be able to see information along with the stream next to it about what tools I'm using and that might be easier. Depending on how you like to visualize things. OK, I want to move down to the random plants and. Things down here under the trees so I didn't merge the trees down yet, which is good 'cause I need to paint underneath of that layer. It's going to be a lot easier. Like this, so a bunch of these trees back here have kind of a similar texture to them. We can go a little bit a little bit later Green on top of these. Darker Green Shadows. A little bit of a cool teal reflecting off. And there's a little plant over here. Will just leave it for now with these dots. Appeared there's some plants in a pot hanging down. Well, if any of you are painting along, I hope it's going well and you're enjoying your painting. I feel like right now we're getting to the stage in mind, that's like. A little bit that awkward stage when you're working on a painting where a lot of things are blocked in, but then other things aren't, so it's kind of. Yeah, it's just I feel like it's a little hard sometimes to visualize when you get into this certain phase. How to get to the end? From here, there's still like a lot that needs to be done. But we're just going to keep going. We will get there. Thank you honey, you're so sweet. I'm doing good I'm I've still got mighty here. I should be able to make it through the painting. I don't know if we'll do a second one today, but. Should be alright. OK, so we're going to put in some little plant pots down here in the background. Just going to choose. Hopefully a good brush for that. This little Terra cotta pots. Take that back here and we want to put a little bit of warmer, lighter color. Top. So again, I'm trying to visualize this more as a traditional painting. So it's OK if everything isn't very, very precise, and if you can see individual paint strokes and things like that. Then I'm actually I would be happy about that. So I still want it to look. Somewhat realistic in that you see this scene, you can tell what it is and what's going on, and you know these are flower pots and windows and doors and trees. You know we want to have that level of. Realism that you can understand the scene, but other than that I'm happy if it looks more like a painting and it's OK for us to see individual brush strokes and. For stuff not to be super, super precisely painted. And maybe we can add some little things like it's trial and error, but maybe you had like a little pot down here. You know we could add or take away things. We don't have to follow the reference exactly. We might be able to make some changes that improve it based on our tastes. Hi Isabella, welcome. How are you doing? Little pot here. And it's starting to look cute. Flower pots always make a scene nice and cheerful. Hi Everson. How are you? OK, so we've got our furthest flower pots now there's another flower over on the side which I think we don't really see. The pot we just kind of see a plant coming in from from the side. I think that's fine. Nice, I'm glad you could join us. Let's see the difference between this and this. I think is enough, will make a new layer. I'm trying to keep some things on different layers so I can kind of create a little step by step from this. So I think it's going OK. So let's get some more yellow green leaves over here. See if I can give this plan to more specific shape. I really like in the reference how you can tell the individual little branches reaching out an. Kind of dispersing. There's also a window back there. I probably should paint that window in before we cover it with plants. It's a pretty one. More of a red color. OK, so you guys might know this already, but in case you don't this is a fun, very useful trick if you hold if you make a dot and then you hold shift and make another dot it will make a straight line between those two dots. So that's one way to make up for me to make a nice precise shape for this window back here. If I feel like I can't draw a perfectly straight line. And then. Can go back in and. Paint normally. Might lower the opacity a little bit so it fits in better. Seems a little bit dark and was attracting my attention very much. Kinda just wanted to be a nice little background detail. I think maybe I made it too big. This is the advantage of doing things on separate layers. Even though I want the painterly approach, it's nice to be able to just quickly fix that and not have it have been painted right on. 2. The wall let's put this. And I like that detail outside of the window too. Gotta be careful getting into these details, but let's do it. Going to Trader. Draw straight line so it comes something like this. OK, it's not. Exactly. But I like it. That'll work. That'll work. So because that's on its own layer, we can do our lock transparency and grab another color and give a little bit of. Highlight or shading to make this more 3 dimensional. If you see fit, I think in the reference it's a little bit. Lighter in some areas so. Works for me. The last thing is, there's a little bit of like an iron bar going across the window, and it has a nice little pattern to it. So let's see if we can get that in. And it's got some larger bars it split into thirds. And then within that. Thinner ones. To try to find the right amounts, I don't want to cover it completely with bars. Yeah, that's OK. So we can go to image, adjust Hue, saturation. I think I want to lighten this or give it a little bit of a different color. Unlock the transparency and go back in with some shadows. To make it look a little bit more 3D. OK, so I think I'm going to merge those together and just commit to it and will go on so. Let's do it. It's part of the wall. Now you guys. It's not perfectly even, but it's OK. It's an old building. Things can be, some things can be in an even. From now on, I'll be able to just pay on top of that. Thank you. Hi Satish, thank you very much. So I know this particular scene has a lot of detail, is a bit of a complicated one, but not all the scenes that I paint on the stream are have so much going on. You guys are always welcome to paint with me. If you feel like this one is a bit much, maybe maybe next Wednesday would be a can pick something a little less. Detailed. But I was enjoy happy guys painting and sketching with me, so you're welcome to join if you want. Anytime. I think season thank you. Realistically, this plant is kind of coming from the side. Really bro near that is such an honor. Thank you, thank you for being here. Thank you for like making an effort to be here. That's really nice to hear. I appreciate the company. It's nice to hang out with you guys, find it very relaxing to do these and a fun puzzle to figure out how to. How to illustrate them. I've been working on experimenting with some different stylization for my cell phone. It's kind of a little bit new to me over the past months trying to explore the kind of traditional painting style with my digital work, so it's taking a lot of trial and error testing out different things and. Yeah, it's nice to talk about it and think about it and hang out with you guys and I'm happy to like teach my approach. But it's also a little trial and error as I go through here, so it's not always a linear teaching. But you can always ask me if you have any questions about what I'm doing. I don't know if I like what I did. There might erase out a little bit. We'll come back to it. So I want to work on the floor a little bit. The ground. Right now it feels like the trees are just. Coming out of nowhere it that we need to give a little home for the trees we need to give them a nice little place to come out of the ground so it feels more planted. It feels more. Believable So it looks like they're coming out of these tiny little openings. Little squares in the floor. It's not a big space for them to come out of, but I guess it's enough. So. Can see little opening. Look at that. It makes such a difference, but beyond that the whole floor also needs a little bit more love, so there's sort of crisscross pattern. And I don't know if that's gonna be too busy to busy and to kind of technical to get into. Maybe we can just give like a texture. To the floor without going so precise with the exact Criss cross pattern that exists there. Stephanie says, do you ever have moments where you'd stare at a painting for minutes on end and try to figure out what to do next? Your painting so fluently. Thank you. Thank you. I definitely feel that sometimes every once in awhile I'll do it on stream too, but. I do know exactly what you're talking about, so for me more often like as I practice more and more, I feel like I get less of those moments, at least when I'm painting from. From reference when I'm painting from reference, I get less of those moments because I feel like if I get when I look at the image, it gives me a lot more like OK. I need to work on that part. I kind of. It's like it's like I can see it helps me see what to do next. But when I'm painting an original scene and usually even wanna making original, senile have like an accumulation of references, I'll have a like a mood board or a reference board with multiple different ones. And then you know, so I'm still using reference, but. I'm not, I'm kind of creating a new thing from those instead of. Recreating something that exists and those way more often get me into that situation where I'm like I can't visualize what am I doing next and I get like stuck a little bit and sometimes have to take a break, come back to it later and stuff like that. So yeah, it depends on the type of illustration I'm doing when I'm doing studies and things I don't find it quite as problematic. Usually when I'm working from one specific reference it's easier for me to follow. Definitely make streaming quite stressful for me. Yeah, I get that you can always. You can always ask chat you know like sometimes I'll be stuck and I'll say like, what do you guys think that can be? That can be also that can backfire because sometimes then you'll get like 20 suggestions at once, and that can also be confusing, but chat is definitely giving me some good. Suggestions before when I've been stuck, so as long as you get a few good suggestions and not like 50 then it's good. Then it can help. Reassuring awesome. Yes, definitely definitely. Um, let's see. I think viewers wouldn't mind, especially if you narrate your thoughts. That's a really good point hunji, like even when I do get confused, I tend to. I tend to talk about why I'm confused. You are really confused right now. I can't decide what to do here there and that's still an interesting part of the process for people, I think. I can find it interesting when I'm watching an artist to see like what they're struggling with and then how they kind of think through it. So that's a good point. Just talking about it. PC and says well for me it's like Instagram. If the viewers of board there free to go instead of thinking. Jeez, I'm doing nothing. People will get bored. You can see it as people who have POV help you figure out your next move. Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Not stress too much about it. It's hard sometimes not to stress or overthink things, but. You're probably right. Hey Andy, how are you? Yeah, so I like this effect. I'm getting from the. Ground with putting just a little bit of Kris Kross kind, it's extra. I hope it's helping to look like these. This pattern, but without getting too obsessed with it. Hi, a sling more. Happy Wednesday. OK. So there is one thing that might be good to pay attention to, and that is as we as this pattern from the on the sidewalk or on the ground gets closer and closer to us. It does get bigger and the panels in it get thicker and that helps show like distance and perspective because you know farther away all the way. Over here we don't see that kind of detail, so I think that's helpful for someone looking at this. Our viewers looking at our painting, it's going to make more sense if we allow that detailed to be. Less and less as it gets further away. OK, I almost forgot that my trees were on a second layer. I'm like carefully avoiding them, but I can just paint underneath. Hi, I'm above thank you. Thank you for saying that you're very guys are very sweet. I appreciate you hanging out with me and all the nice comments and. Yeah, thank you for being here. I haven't even begun with the table and chairs, so that's a little example of me procrastinating. I think at some point I need to paint them in. There's also a bicycle. Those are going to be a little complicated for me. I think I do want to paint the area around behind and underneath first, but I think we're getting to the point where it's time to start painting that in. So. I'm trying to keep a little record of the process so this is what we've done so far. Is there so many layers for you? Well, I'm only keeping these layers so that I can make a little process thing later. I'm not actively using all of these so these are just layers of the progress of the painting I've been saving the past ones for reference to show later. But at the moment I'm actually using two to three layers for my painting. Yeah here let me show you the let me show you the bicycle. There it is. I wonder I might not include the bicycle my painting. I think the focal point of the. Table and chairs. Hundreds like I don't see what I don't see one either. I think the table and chairs are nice focal point. The bicycle is partially covered by the chair and the. I I don't think it's perfect. I don't think it's perfect. If anything, if I were going to redesign this, it might be nice if the bicycle was like on one of these trees back here. It's a little cluttered over here. So I think I'm just going to go with the. Like either the table and chair evil, either just the bicycle or just the table and chairs, and I think the table and chairs are going to look nicer. I don't know if you're the one to ask this, but is there a vacancy on this street? Made out of cake with your painting, I want to move there. I know I'm ready to go on vacation to this place. I it's in Spain. And Yeah, it looks beautiful. Yeah, yeah, we're going to do we're on the same page. Angie, we're on the same page. Well, that's good to hear. So you agree. Alright, well let's. Let's begin with the blocking in the table and chairs. Actually, you know what I'm going to procrastinate even more. But this is actually needed. There's I want to get the lighting working below here before we put the table and chairs, because if you guys can see the table and chairs, most of it is a silhouette. So the IT needs to have this pretty bright light on the wall behind it and then even some bounce light on the floor underneath the chairs. This is also blowing a lot an I think it helps to show the table and chairs because then they look very dark compared to the. The background and without that being dark. Yeah, it's not going to make their shape pop out as much. Wow, that is impressive. That is impressive. Stephanie. I don't know if I would have picked that out. I think I might have guessed like Italy or something if I was. If I was going to guess, I would've probably been wrong. Well, I would have definitely been more so there you have it, but I also haven't been to Spain so I maybe if I had been there before I would have. Been more likely to. To recognize it, have you been in Istanbul? I never have more near. Maybe someday. Well, the the. The ground in my painting seems almost as if it's on a curve. But maybe that's fine. 'cause this is a very old place. Old buildings. They can be. Things can be a little crooked, right? All right, so we're cleaning up a nice backdrop for our table and chairs to come in. I think we're almost ready for it. OK. Ah, I can't. We're saying about the bicycle. But hey, you can always use it in your painting if you if you do one of the scene. One of the things that I find interesting when we do these group studies and multiple people paint along is that. Different people leave different things out. Different people focus on different things in the image, something that's like a really key thing to another person is less important. And that's an interesting thing. The entire artist interpretation. If we have extra time, we can consider adding the bicycle, but. To me it's less important than the other things. To me, and there's a lot going on in this scene. Very busy, so I'm going to prioritize the other things first, and then maybe we can add the bike. Alright, so we have one chair. Table. So pro designer, if you open the link below this stream the. The photographer did tagged this as Santa Cruz. But I don't know if there's a more specific location. I don't know if you're looking for more specific about like the exact like cafe or something like that. I don't know if we're going to know. We're going to know that specifically, but the photographer I gave a good amount of location information there. I have not been to India. I've been too well. I'm from the United States. I've been to I live in the Netherlands and I've been to Belgium, Germany and. Italy, but other than that I haven't been through. Many haven't been to other countries. I've been to Canada. But yeah, I would love to do more world traveling. In the future. Hi Marissa, how are you? So there's two tables next to each other, so we're going to get. Drinking in both in there. I'm going to put them closer together. I think I might actually turn on smoothing on my brush. I feel like I'm making very. Wobbly brushstrokes right now. With these little details. I'm going to try to stay pretty relaxed about these details on painting in right now. And I do want everything to look believable enough, so I don't want anything to be super super wonky, but I'm going to try to stay loose and be OK with the fact that this is going to be again. I'm were considered more concerned with the mood in the lighting in the scene rather than things being like super, super realistic. I wanted to look like a painting. So not not going for photo realism. I want to try again at the second table. I notice that I made them look too too matchy. Matchy couldn't give a slightly different angle to this one I think so they don't look so identical. That's a little better. At least there's a little more space between them. Alright, the tables are really pretty, they have. And this shine. You can see the. Reflection of light on the top of the tables. So I want to get that affect in mind too, so I'm going to finish them off. And then we'll add a little highlight. Hopefully it will be. Satisfying, I find highlights like some of the most fun of the whole painting process. OK, so we've got our tables. We can lock the transparency with the checkerboard icon and pick a darker Brown and add a little bit of shadow like underneath the top of the table that first. Maybe a little bit of shadow right there, so it's a little darker right underneath the very top. And also. We can give some shading to the individual legs if we want. It would be so nice, Susan, I would really go for that right now sitting at one of these tables having a cup of coffee, reading a book or chatting or sketching or just sitting and enjoying the beautiful location. That would definitely love that. It's one of the reasons I like painting places like this is. It's a big. Painting relaxing scenes if they just make me feel good to look at and. Yeah, they make me happy to paint and give a lot of good vibes. I hope you know as an artist and I also make traditional art and soul. My traditional paintings and I hope when people buy my artwork and have it in there. In their home that it makes them feel happy and gives those kind of feelings of like remembering being an application somewhere or just some nice feeling like that's what I like in, uh, there's different purposes to artwork. Sometimes you make art because it's you know. Artwork can be advertising. Artwork can be. You can be giving a message with your art. There's so many different things, but for me a lot of what I like to do with my art is just create pieces that give good feeling and make people feel happy when they see them. And so I like landscapes with a nice feeling and sometimes with like a nastalgic feeling, nice lighting and things like that. This is what I'm attracted to when I make art. Four months of winter here. Until we have a nice sitting out weather. Ryan, you guys are really got a ways to go. Still four months I think here in here in the Netherlands it's getting warmer. I think it'll be another month or two before it's like. Warm But it's already. It's already improving slightly. High paying welcome. Pretty sure it's in front of the Legato Alcazar Hotel. How did you find that? Oh my gosh, it would be so cool to go stay there after having painted this already that would be wild. I could actually do a painting there in person. Maybe someday. Maybe someday it's a future. Future travel destination. Cool well I don't know how you found it or if you've been there but. Thanks for sharing. Wow, really Marissa? Is that unusual for this time of year? That sounds really intense. It's getting colder here in Edinburg, oh. I I felt a little bit of that here in the Netherlands, like we had a very strange January which was really warmer than usual and felt like we were already going right into spring and then it did get colder again and I was like, no, you're going the wrong way. But Now it seems like. Going getting a little warmer again. Yeah, I can understand that right? Everyone's like getting in their bathing suits. Wow, that is intense. So I'm adding a little bit more shading underneath the. Table and chairs. There's going to be shadows right below each individual little foot and stuff like that. So we can put these little marks. Also, there's another chair, so I shouldn't be getting too carried away. I might have to move things. Don't know what the norm is. I've only been in Austin for six months. Oh, I see move from Indiana. Well, I hope you're liking it. I lived in Florida for most of my life, so I was used to it being pretty hot alot of the year and not having two too much in the way of seasons. It sounds like it's pretty pretty warm where you are too. There can be advantages and disadvantages to that. I definitely miss. A higher average of sunny days. There's a lot of cloudy and rainy days where I live now in comparison. Sometimes I. Sometimes I get a little tired of it, sometimes it can be cozy, but. After a while you want to see the sun. I haven't used fresco, Steven. I've I've heard some good things about it, and I've seen some really nice art created in the program. I like that I really like the idea of the traditional texture, since that's something that I'm really trying to get in my work. But yeah, just haven't tried it yet. I have a bunch of. I feel like. I have enough on my hands at the moment. Maybe it maybe at some point if I start to feel at all like stale with what I'm doing then I like to mix it up trying a new medium or new. New technique or something like that, but at the moment the flick I've got a lot on my hands as part of the reason I haven't tried fresco yet. Sadly, we do jump from a very warm spring, so hot summer. Trying to remember which what's on what layer we're going to have to merge soon, so too many layers for my liking, but I feel like it's a lot easier to paint this what I'm doing it right now. If I keep things separate temporarily until the chairs blocked in everything is blocked in then will merge it all. Mr. Since during the winter I have the Heat in Texas, I just got a dog being able to take her on walks every day. It's been really nice not looking forward to the summer though. Yeah, that's going to be really warm. Yeah, that was the same for me. Was that most of the time the Florida weather in the winter is pretty nice. Like cool like warm but with some cool breeze, not too hot. Fall and winter are the best year. Was waiting in winter to snow here in Istanbul, but unfortunately it's not same for me. It didn't snow where I live in the Netherlands and I think I think that some part of the country got snow, but it wasn't where I am. And it was just a little bit. Anyway, it was like a one day thing and it melted pretty quick. So yeah, it was like not a real winter. Alright, so I'm giving a little little tiny. Dots to the. The top and the bottom of the chair to make it feel a little bit more. Grounded. Now in the reference, there's two more chairs. One is behind here. Behind the other one and one is a little further down. This is the type of stuff that I honestly find a little tedious to do, like I. Of the whole painting. This is the part that I'm kind of like. I feel like I have to sort of use my. Discipline a little bit more to get through this part and get into the areas that I'm more interested in painting, but. Gotta do it if we want to paint the rest of the scene. We gotta paint these chairs. It's a little bit tedious. But it'll be worth it. All right, we've got one back here. I'm trying to keep them roughly in the right. Um proportions to each other so that it feels like they are the same size and belong at the same table. Resize this one. We gotta put little cushions and then we should be good to go. That's a nice red cushions on the chairs, although we could change different colors and have to be read, but I think the colour works is pretty classic. Sorry, my neighbors outside making some noise, so I hope it's not too annoying for you guys. Alright, I'm going to put all the chairs on one layer. Actually this one I can't 'cause it's in front of the others. But let's begin with the little cushions. So the cushions show a lot of they have a big. 3D kind of quality to them because they have a dark shadow on the bottom and then the area that's being hit by light is quite a bit brighter and more pink, so it's really pretty and makes the cushions really have a 3D kind of pop to them. So I'm starting with the darker color. And then we will pick something later still, like a red color. And that's not it. So it. Start for 2 hours and just melted ha. That's kind of what happened here, although it didn't snow in my area, but in the South part of the Netherlands, it seems like it snowed in. In Belgium. It snowed for a little bit and then didn't last very long so. Yeah. Maybe next year. I know some of you are living in places where it's noted time that you probably like. Quit complaining, but I was just hoping to take some reference pictures in the snow for painting, so that's why I was. I was really hoping for it. All right, and the chairs also have these little. Weaved. Pieces supports in the back that are really pretty and there like this tan color. I guess I should just probably paint a solid color for that. Trying to decide how to approach this. I'm going to undo that. It snowed in Austin for bits and melted. Everyone was freaking out so I guess it doesn't. Usually snow there then. I bet. It's always fun for kids. In that case they may have not seen it. Very much before. OK, so I'm going to paint this in a solid color. The backs of the chairs. Get the weave pattern in there. All right? There's some places where the light is hitting these iron chairs, and we get a different colour reflecting off of them like a. Bright Green Gray, Green, Blue. I don't know see if we can find the right color. Something like that. So the lights heading here. I want to make sure that it. Shows up that way. And we can also choose, you know 'cause. With artists in the situation, you can choose to add a little extra light somewhere that it doesn't actually exist. If you really want to draw attention to some area, you can choose to make that your focal point. All you need to do is. You know, maybe add a little bit more of a pop of light there. You like the chairs, thank you. Well then they were worth the effort. Thank you, Suzanne, thank you. Add a little more highlight up at the top. The chairs have been extra little detail in them, but I think I'm going to keep it simple for now because at this rate the painting is going to go very slow, so I'm going to merge them together. So now I have this all together as one. And I think I like overall the position of the chairs and everything. It's not identical to the reference, it's a little bit. Bigger. Can make it a little smaller and closer to the tree. Look like 3D chairs. Oh, thank you. Well, I'm glad that they look. Believable 3D Wise. The shadow side of the of the chairs is. On the right, in this case, away from the wall, where we get a lot of bounce light so I can add a little extra shadow on the. Chairs facing that side, we want to make them. A little bit more 3D. So I want to work on the area behind the chair is a little bit and I think it might be finally time to get into some specific shapes of these leaves on the walls and things like that. So I'm going to take the same brush that I used to actually paint the leaves on the trees or one of the one of the brushes and use that to paint the leaf pattern on the wall and we'll see how it goes. It might be a little bit too. Specific because with this situation, the dappled lighting off, then you'll see a like a blur effect. It's not going to be like so so so perfectly precise, so we could use a blur filter. That would be one way to do this, so I'm going to paint them in with this brush, just allowing them to be pretty crisp, and then let's try a blur filter and see if that looks good. So basically going from the light towards dark and vice versa giving this look of specific little leaves. On the wall. Some color picking from the pink going into the. The white and then back and forth. I'm trying to make some interesting shapes here. Takes a little trial and error. All the way up here. Glad I didn't merge the trees down yet. 'cause I can now paint behind the tree pretty easily still. Appear there's tiny, tiny little flecks of light. I really like it. It's very pretty. Maybe I should have made the shadows even darker on the. The wall, that way these light. Patches would be even more dramatic. But there might be something that we can edit. OK, so I've done a bunch of leaves. She let's raise this up a little bit. Higher in the reference we see this end. This Patch of lay end above the chair. And then there's another. Come down here. Something like that. It looks very messy, but let's see what we can do filter. I'm going to go to blur and there's a lot of different blurs we can use, lens blur, gausian blur, motion blur can sometimes be good for this kind of thing. If you put it at a very very low amount of motion. I'm going to go for a Gaussian blur. Thing. Should the arm on the left be there? Oh no, I need to cover that up. Good catch. OK, so this is with a little bit of a blur filter. I don't know if I really like it. I think part of the reason is because we're taking. We're kind of combining. Uh. I'm trying to take a traditional approach to painting this, so I guess putting like a photographic lens blur filter it could work, but it's not really taking it in the direction I'm trying to go in. Where is our chairs? OK yeah we need to. Get rid of this OK. Better. OK, I'm going to get rid of that. I'm going to do a lot of trial and error sometimes in a painting, so I'm going to try again with the. Might be OK once you add more brightness. Yeah, let's let's take a look at that, so I'm going to make a selection of this area. And I will add an adjustment layer. Let's look at the levels. So now it's only adjusting that wall. I think I want to just really bump up the contrast there. I don't know. Maybe I should do that to the whole the whole image. It definitely makes it feel brighter. Definitely feel the light a little bit more intensely. There's a couple places we might like that brighter light so. Our result there. The ground will get a little bit more of that balance late too. This little bit of a glow. Yeah, I definitely want to put a glow around it. I think that'll be really satisfying to do. So for me I have the tendency to. To like painting the. The shape and getting well in this case I think it would be nice to get like a clean shape for what I want with the patches of light. And then. Will add some. Will add a little extra glow. On top of that I think is going to be my plan. Want to sit in this painting has some coffee. It is like giving everyone that feeling me too me too. I'm ready for cappuccino. OK, I'm going to paint with the image in black and white for a little bit. I showed this earlier, but there's a shortcut that you can set up in Photoshop. You just have to set it up once and it will always be there for you. It turns it allows you to turn your painting quickly into black and white, and you can actually color pic and paint while you're painting is in. This black and white. Version and it's Super Super Handy. So I think one of the things that I want to do is just real quick, like paint in this. Black and white to fix some of my. Values the shading dark to light shading wasn't working. Perfectly here. So we're going to paint them black and white for a couple moments and then take a look at it. Ha ha oh you guys are sweet. Well enjoy your coffee. Awesome, good mood. Definitely get moved. Hi John Paul. Welcome. So I'm going to brighten up a larger area and then we're going to come back with leaf shapes. And cut into that area little bit. I'm going to make this center bar a little bit smaller. My proportions were a little bit off. OK, let's go back alright, so here's the before and after before after. Sometimes it really helps to turn it in black and white. To get a fresh look. But I do want to do some more work on this wall in general. Getting there. Yeah. It's it's getting a little better. OK, I'm going to try making a new layer. We're going to put it on overlay. And I will choose an airbrush. And I want to brighten up the. Even the shadows on the wall there just a little too dark, I think. So I'm using overlay. I'm going to choose a brighter maybe. A warm orange. And. Try to lighten up some area around the highlights. Hey sorry please. Thanks, I'm glad you liked the reference. I'm going to put a layer on lightning mode also and try that. I just feel like. Overall, I want the sunlight feeling to come through a lot more than it was. So it may differ from the reference a little bit, but you know what? This is our painting. We gotta sometimes make choices like that. Going to be able to fill a Freedom to make some artistic. We can be art directors. In our paintings. So giving him a little bit more fantasy colors. And I will merge those down. So so if anybody is just getting here sour puss, I can go back in time and show you the start of this painting. I've been saving the layers as we go so we can do a little. Progress. Yeah, so that's where we are right now. So we can do layer and I want to work on the leaf shapes. Let's get back to that. But I haven't figured out how. I might just have to kind of paint them by hand. Just go in here and do this. I was looking for a. Magic. Brush effect. And maybe even a softer brush would be nice. Alright, so just like we're bringing little white leaf shapes into the pink or bringing pinkley shapes into the white, just like you see in the reference, some of them are going to be separate from the group. So we're going to get some random little ones in here. Stuff like that. Thank you muneer. Did you use religious for the chair? They look very good. Oh thanks. I'm glad to hear that I didn't use anything special for the chairs. Just just looking at the reference. But they were a little bit tedious to do compared to the rest of the painting, which has been pretty fun. I feel like the chairs were like I had kind of slow down and. Get into the details there, but glad I'm glad it worked. The references from Spain. And I found it on Unsplash. If you want to see the originals photographer, put the original photographers post. There's a link below the stream description. It's such a pretty such a pretty reference. Thanks thanks Sir Plus. Yeah, if anybody. If you guys like the image, you're welcome to use it. And share your art. If you paint along, its from Unsplash so it's a free to use image. Like the color. Things to. Yes, now I'm just using a basic round brush for these little highlights. Collected for leader. Yeah, good idea. I've been keeping little little collections on Unsplash and. Pixabay and pixels to use for painting reference and things like that. It's nice, especially when. There's a day where you want to work on something, but you just don't have any ideas. You can go find something nice and just do a little study. Olivier, thank you. So I'm going to do the same thing up here and. Go back and forth with the leaf shapes. There's a few places that need to do this. I like this hot pink color. It's really intense. And the Orange. Maybe it's a little too intense, but I like it. So I'm sorry that I'm not explaining too much at the moment, I'm kind of doing the same thing over and over here, 'cause I'm just working on going back and forth with these little circles, so there's not too much to say about this. But if you do happen, have any questions about anything or what I'm doing, you're welcome to ask. Well, most through this step I think. Ah. Good vibes well cheers. Choose. Drinking some tea over here. Always have to have tea while painting or coffee. Gotta have something nice. From the relaxing painting session. Love in your second version of the wall. Happy and bright thanks. I think it was I think is an improvement. Had a lot of. Yeah, the shadows were a little too dark. I mean, even though I think this is like brighter than the reference. For some reason, I feel like it's working better. Yeah, good spot. Harry is the Starbucks Florida edition. Kind of an older mug now. Alright, we're gonna have a little plant coming in from the side looking at the chairs now compared with the light and everything next to it. I'm wondering if I need to make the shares a little bit brighter. I'm wondering if I need to make them a little bit brighter. Because it seems like now they feel really dark compared to the area that they were sitting in, and I don't know if that makes little sense. They should be probably a little bit brighter. Or at least like more contrast between the braids in the darks. Hopefully that reads OK. All. On sorry gene pool, but I'm glad you're still watching and and learning something. That's a great thing about stream, because honestly, I'm better at showing things than. Then I explaining in a lot of words so. Let's get at least we can. We can see what's going on. Yeah, I find it a lot easier to. Show what I what I mean with the visuals. So there's a little sprinkling of light appear in the blue. Hi Alma's, loving it. Would you say your styles mix of realistic in watercolor feel? Thanks I would love to describe it as that in traditional. I'm a gouache painter that's just my favorite medium at the moment. And I like watercolor too and gouaches water medium. You know, it's a little bit different, but I think that's where a lot of the influences coming from. I'm trying to apply things that I am learning from traditional gouache medium, which I really love and bring some of those textures and effects into digital to give it a more traditional feeling so. Yeah, I would say so and it's nice to hear if you are getting that impression. Because I did digital painting before getting into traditional painting, I. I feel like I it was easier for me to gravitate towards Gouache because you can paint the light colors over top of dark colors and things. I tried to do some watercolor. And I found it super super difficult because you have to really plan out everything and you can't. Once you go to dark in an area, there's not too much you can do about it unless you're going to bring in another type of medium. So. I notice that. I think it has a little bit to do with my digital background that I prefer gouache. For that ability. Hi Ahmed Gaitian Welcome everybody. You guys can find my reference image below in the description. If you're interested to check it out, there's also a bunch of links there I have. Things that I get commonly asked. I tried to just link below so there might be something you're looking for. Oh my gosh, I'm a huge fan Harry. I'm a huge fan of James Gurney's work and his YouTube channel is super, super informative. He has some. Really good books as well. That's awesome if you see any similarity at all between us. It's a big compliment, so thank you. Halo Sama Welcome everybody, hope you're having a good day. So right now I'm working on the. Not shadows, but the bounce light underneath the chairs. There's some light reflecting off of the wall pretty brightly, so we're going to get the lights in and then we need some darks too because there is not only bright highlights but there's little shadows in little under the chair an with I guess there's little like garbage cans or something I don't know. I'm not going to paint those in. Are the chairs and tables going to have worse? A slight drop shadows yes yes they will. They need drop shadows right now. They're not quite. It's not quite selling me that, they're like, really. Sitting there in the scene. I mean, they're there, but they're not. We need more evidence. We need more shadows, I think yeah. On the same page. Alright, let's try it and see what we can do a little bit more. I'm going to flip for some reason. I feel like it's going to be easier for me to do it from this angle, so flip the reference to. I'm gonna try to let myself just kind of sketch these in. Maybe I'll switch back to a more textured brush and although we got through the leaf painting that I was kind of struggling with. I have a brush that has like a canvas texture to it and it's kind of fun. I'm not sure if it's like 2 too much for this, but. The scene is so colorful, even the shadows here in the reference, the shadows have a really bright blue to them. Of course I might be. Exaggerating it a little bit, but. Also over here on the ground there's a little bit more like teal. Blue bounce light. For those of you painting along as I think there's maybe at least one of you. I hope you're having a good time and enjoying your painting. I'm curious where you're thinking of this one. Yeah, there's a lot of sort of crisscross overlapping going on the ground here. I'm fighting against my urge to kind of make this more clean 'cause I don't want it to be overly clean. I wanted to feel more like a painting and yet I still sometimes struggle to. Allow things to be messy. OK, I think. I think we can move away from the table and chairs for a little bit. And work on. Some other areas of the painting. I also think I'm going to merge the trees and everything. Hopefully that's not going to be a big mistake. So now we have these steps so far. So first. Here. 2. Some what's how it went down, so we'll go from here. On a new layer one thing, but I haven't included yet or all the gates on the doors and everything. So I can try to add those will see how it looks on a new layer. So just a little. A little detail, but I think. It gives. Some personality and you know it tells little about this place and. Can I identifiable marker for different locations? These kind of artistic? Little accents. Thanks. The architectural things. There's going to be plants in front of these. I think these might actually be windows rather than doors. The ones I'm painting right now. So they're going to be more plants on the ground in front covering, covering there a little bit. Muneer says is it difficult to learn digital painting techniques like it appears in this Christmas winter elf posts? So Meunier brought up one of my paintings. This style is, I think popularly known as semi realistic style. So if you're looking to find tutorials and things related to it, just look up semi realism. There's there's one artist in particular that I learned a lot from her name is she goes by online sticky Meechan, so you may have heard of her. She does a lot of pinups, character pinup, art and things, so I'm going to put the name in the chat. So you can see how it's spelled. She has a Patris on where she does tutorial videos and things an I subscribe to her Patreon for. Like over a year earlier in my digital art journey and it was a really really big help to me. In understanding how to do those particular, she has a lot of really good. Ways to do that kind of illustration? She works really quick. She got a lot of efficient workflow that she does with those so. You do have to. It is like a subscription with Patris on so I think she might have a couple free videos on YouTube but it was really really worth the money for me even if you only subscribe for like one or two months you get a lot of videos each term. So it's I thought it was like very good. Content for the price. So I would look for Sikimi Chan. That's who I learned from on how to paint like that or just semi realist semi realism. There's a lot of tutorials out there from different artists so I'm sure you'll be able to find something. And he said, is it difficult? To learn. It did. It did take me awhile. I did I did do a lot of paintings to get better with that, but. I hadn't done really done something like it before, so it was. I had to put in the time, it wasn't. It wasn't super easy, but it you definitely. Once you get through the early stages it does get easier. It's like a little bit of gotta push through the tough beginning and then it's like OK, I'm starting to get it. You know what I mean? It's it's worth the effort, but it wasn't super easy for me. I definitely had to put in time to learn. But her techniques make it a lot easier rather than trying to figure it all out yourself. When you said Christmas elf, I was thinking of something completely different really. Yeah yeah it's not. Not not a silly Christmas love, but like a winter winter forest. Oh yeah, she was. She's more of like A. Fantasy. Fantasy character than like a holiday one, but I painted it around Christmas time. Yeah, you're welcome. I hope I hope it helps. If you end up checking him out. I really like these little swirly details supports on the building here. Take a look at what time it is. Who time is going fast? OK. Well, we're doing doing pretty well. I'm going to try to. Start pulling things together with this. So we can work towards like the polishing and. Finishing phase. I don't know what is up here. If there's like a some fines or something, but there's like some red Flowers up here. I think they're attached onto another balcony that I didn't include in my painting. So I'm going to try something else. Instead of doing the balcony, I'm going to put a little swirly swirly vines up here, 'cause I like the idea of there being red Flowers back there. Thanks season. K project Oh my God yes, project joined the coffee club. Come join us. We're going to be sipping sipping cappuccinos outside here. Talking about painting. You're like the fourth person or fifth person who said that, including I was also thinking the same thing. We're on the same page. We're ready for a trip. Alright, let's pop in some little red Flowers. For those of you painting along, if there is anyone I know it's nice to know roughly when I'm going to be ending so that you can. Share your art along at the end. So I want to be able to give you an estimate, but I'm not sure I'm. I'm thinking maybe 30 to 40 minutes if things go well for me to finish this up, but I'm not. You know, sometimes I can be really wrong and estimates depending on if things go smoothly or not. Love this kind of painting. I mean making creatures or Dragons making something mystery. Ah yes, like mystery fantasy type stuff. I like that too. I definitely like it as something to look at, like as a viewer. I also like looking at that type of Art. As a creator. I like it also, but generally more humanoid characters like, not necessarily Dragons and stuff. It's not that I don't like it, I just don't. I tend towards human human characters. My starting up another crystal study for Friday. Nice, I thought about doing another one today and I was like. I've done a few of them already, was like I kind of feel like doing something different. So here we are. Mix ended up a little bit. Little details on the pipes. There's also some wires running through here. Well, the colour should be a little bit more like blue green color. So these tiny little wires I love things like this because it seems like when you're painting them, it's like, seems silly to paint like little wires and stuff like, hey, that's not very aesthetic, but doesn't give an overall kind of cozy feeling to the scene when you include those details. I think it's nice. Maybe we can be a little choosy like I'm not going to paint in a little trash can. But I like the wires. The wires I'll do. Better paper now learned from my last crystals. I think doing one more in watercolor would be good kind of put into practice. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. What paper did you get? Are you saying cold pressed or hot pressed? I'm curious, I can't remember if you. If we discussed this already. If you like the texture paper. Haha why yourself ugly face once you have them and they work. Yeah, it's definitely a little at first like. Going to have a bunch of 'em in there. I think that it starts to make more sense. Also, that's of course of personal preference thing too. Maybe not everybody agrees. Cold pressed save hot pressed. It freaks me out too smooth. I like hot pressed but I'm kinda with you like I don't know I like. Something in between, almost like for me. It's perfect if it has a very very light texture. I don't like deep deep grooves in the paper. But a light texture is nice. It's great when you find the perfect paper. Steven, thank you. Thanks a lot. If you guys have any questions, let me know. Was using 25% cotton, which is fine for gouache but really stops me from doing washes in Gouache now. Small sheets of 100% or did some bigger without but have to be next week. Yeah, that will be. That will definitely help. I notice the difference myself. Two with those papers. If you don't have a big enough proper paper in the cotton paper, sometimes yeah, if you're going to be painting really, really with a lot of water, it just. It's so unpleasant. Hot press is great for airbrushing that makes sense. That makes sense. I normally used Haha. I normally use hot press paper despite my. Complaints it's my usual go too, but sometimes I like the type of paper companies that make hot press that have the tiniest bit of like a smooth texture. But you can just see the paper texture tiny tiny bit. Versus like the Super super smooth one Jackson. Yes I can see your message. Almost since I started using Photoshop, it really has done wonders what type type of studies do you suggest I do since I just started using photo shop. Oh, I have suggestions. Well, first of all, almost what kind of art do you want to be able to do? Ideally like what do you want to? Are you interested in portraits, landscapes, anything? Just open minded. Let me know if you have a particular thing in mind. Thank you, thank you, carry him if you. If you guys are interested below my stream in the description, there's a link there. It says resources and tutorials page and there's a link that has been a list that I've been compiling over the past years that I've been doing digital art. Just things that have helped me out overtime so it's all like the most helpful tutorials that I found and lots of good stuff there, at least to my tastes. All things that I found super helpful, so I hope you'll find something. In there you know there's YouTube channels, there's stuff on Gumroad and Patrion and all different types of things. One of the things that was really transformative in my art, like I don't know how else to explain it like something that really really changed everything for me was. Doing shorter time studies and doing virtual plein air painting. So I was interested in doing environments and just working overall on my understanding of color, an light, different, different lighting scenarios and things like that. If you're really not interested in landscapes and you want to do portraits, for example, I think you can apply this kind of idea to anything. But the idea is doing along with whatever other projects. Let's say you have, you're also doing some personal work and that you. Want to spend more time on and you know, get a nice Polish result to your painting. That's totally fine too. Obviously continue doing that, but along with those types of works, if you find sometimes sneak in some time to do studies for yourself that are shorter and anything between like for me, I would say 45 minutes to a couple hours and just focus on. The very basics for each thing like the most important things you want to work on our composition. And values like the lights and darks in the scene and colors but don't worry too much about detail. Don't worry too much about textures and things like that, just focus on the basic things at the beginning and so you're going to learn. The thing is when you're painting a landscape so much of the important part of the painting happens at the very beginning. It happens in the first hour and 2 hours and then after that you're doing a lot of little. Polishing your polishing, making things look nice. And this not, but if you really want to get the most bang for your Buck out of the time that you're spending studying, do shorter studies where you just practice that initial stage of the painting process where you're most likely going to fall into errors and problems, and then do that and then move on to the next one. So stop after the couple hours, try to get as much done as you can that time, and then start the next one and just do those as your studies is not to say you shouldn't spend more time on your work in other. Situations, but this is a specific type of study that you want to do along with your other work. All Mrs. I fell in love with a sceneries. After seeing your work and also staying in Germany. There's a lot of beautiful sceneries that I want to paint. I do want to try doing semi realistic paintings of figures similar to yours so I can add them to the environments. That's really cool to hear. I feel like we have a lot of the same goals or you kind of have a similar experience to meet with some of your inspirations. So let me give you a couple links in particular. So there's a video. By you guys, maybe no proco already. He has a YouTube channel that's super super awesome for artists. Lots of really good. Really good information, but he has a video I'm going to share in the chat right now that I would suggest watching to anyone and it's about. Doing these quick plein air or virtual Plein Air Studies that are shorter and the reason why to do them, he explains it better and in more detail than what I'm saying now. So if you're a little confused about what I'm saying, watch this video. It's like 8 minutes. It's well done and it's going to explain how to make. Yeah, maximize the efficiency of your practice sessions. That's what he's talking about. And So what I do is a lot of studies that are called Virtual Plein Air Studies. I did not invent this. OK, there's a lot of artists doing this, so the idea is you use a website, for example, map crunch. Com is a really popular one. To find images from anywhere in the world. I'm going to post that link in the chat too. So you can just press go and it's going to take you to a random place, so these images are mostly from the Google Street View car, so you're going to see a lot of the side of the road, but there's also you'll find really cute places like look. There's very paintable places that you find on here. Just clicking go. Going to all different kinds of moods, all different kinds of times of the year, times of day, such a variety and it's super super useful to find a composition that you like from here and paint that and do it in like the shorter amount of time and just work on doing these overtime. You're going to get better at so many things are going to get better at lighting. You're going to get better picking compositions from these. You're going to get better at. You're going to get faster, so it's like the most transformative thing that I started doing for my art. Was this particular type of study. Before doing this, I was. Yeah, which is a lot slower and I had a lot less. This was a way for me to get like a lot of knowledge and experience in a relatively short amount of time 'cause I was spending many, many many hours on each painting so it was kind of like taking me longer to gain the experience. So this is a really helpful way of studying, especially if you're interested in doing environments. Just doing quick studies from these. If you look at my Instagram, which I'll post in the chat again in a moment, you can scroll through and see a lot of. My. Virtual Plein Air paintings. From the past, I don't post all of them, but I posted a lot of them and. Yeah, there's just. There's so many. I've been doing. These are probably done hundreds of them, and that might seem overwhelming. But don't think about any number. Just think about doing like. Whenever whatever works for you, maybe you want to try to do 1 every other day, or like it depends on your individual. If you're working. If you're in school, how many? What went your study regiment is going to be? If you want to try to be on a schedule at all, but I think it's a really good goal to try to have some kind of schedule and just stick with it. Overtime, it's going to turn into something that you have a bunch of knowledge that you didn't have before. If you just stick with it. I promise. Um owner says, is it difficult for someone who works in graphic design and coding websites to learn digital painting? I don't think that it's difficult for someone in graphic design or like that's not what would make it difficult. It's not like that's working against you or anything linear. It's just. For any one, it's going to be work to learn this kind of thing. For some people, some people maybe have a little bit more of a natural vision in some way or another, like some people tend to be better with Stylizing. Some people tend to have. Maybe they work well with colors, like sometimes people have little bit of a natural strength towards a certain area, but beyond that everyone has to go through the same pains. Learning something new regardless of what you've done before if. If you already use photo shop and you already have some knowledge of general. Design rules for your graphic design that could help you, rather than someone who has no artistic knowledge and no knowledge of photo shop, you're in a better place in that person, for example. Really, oh, that's so cool almost. Yeah yeah, let me take a look. That was very nice of him. Oh these are awesome. 3D. Yeah, a lot of these are places I would love to paint. For example something like this. This is absolutely a scene I would like to paint. Like the beautiful lighting, warm and cool, the Blues and warm golds. That's awesome. Alright, I might be falling behind a little bit in the in the chat. You guys let me see. OK, I think I caught up. If I missed any questions you guys can you guys can repost it. If anything scrolled up if I didn't see any question you wanted answered, make sure you post it again and I'll. I'll be sure to answer it. I'm going to try to do the finishing touches on this painting here. There's still a couple of flower pots missing, so that's very important. We can't be missing flower pots. He's this photo shop in 3D Max. A lot. You have three having 3D in your toolkit is really awesome for digital painting. Yeah, maybe you guys could do some collaborations in the future that be really fun like you can paint over 3D. A lot of artists and concept artists use 3D's. There you know there. Underpainting not really underpainting, but they paint on top of it. As a base to make the. Seem more realistic and solid and everything. Proper perspective and everything working out. All right, so we've got to put a couple pot planters here. I want to. Make them pretty. Big compared to the ones in the back. Remove this one over. I'm keeping them on separate layers to start with because it's really nice to be able to move from around like this. And sort sort that out without having them be merged, and then as soon as we decide where they're going to go. Merged. So this one will be a little bit of A. Warmer color I think mostly because it's closer to the wall with all this bright bounce light. Yes, that's right, that's right meunier. You are correct about my color wheel. If anybody is interested, I put the link to it in the description below the stream. There's also a discount code. The color wheel is an external plugin that has some extra options and things. Not a. Requirements but. I like it. Let's go a little bit a little bit brighter on this one. Yeah, we're almost there. Then we gotta put some plants. I really like the contrast and type of leaves. These have little bit more almost like tropical leaves. So I think I might start with just the big. Green blob. And then we'll we'll add some more. Leaves with specific shapes coming out, but I'm going to try to block in a big shape first before I get into individual leaves. Oh, nice surface perfect. OK, so we've got a bunch of green here to start with, but now I'm going to take the lasso tool an make these little shapes for these sharp. Leaves coming out and I'm going to hold shift to keep adding more and more leaves because it's hard to make this whole shape at one time so. Shift and just add more and more. Yeah, I think so too. I think so too. Is not for free. Yeah, it's not free the Coulouris. If you have photo shop, if you have a CC 2019 or later like any more recent versions of photo shop, you can go to window color. And then you you may be seeing the Hue Cube. This is the default, but you can. Go to the color wheel. You can click this and go to color wheel and then you'll get this one. So. That one comes with photo shop, so you don't have to pay extra for it. It has slightly less. Some of it doesn't have all of the features of Coulouris, but honestly I don't even use most of these anyway. I like colors because I like how the interface looks and I like how large it displays the foreground color. So. Just arrived from living this painting place. Reminds me of my hometown. Hi Eric, thank you. That's awesome. I don't know where your hometown is, but this is in Spain, so maybe it's maybe it's close to where you from. But it seems like you're from a beautiful place. Almost as a way to contact you if we have questions. Yeah, so there's so I will put an invite. I don't know if you use discord, but I have a discord community. That you might enjoy it to be apart of. You can share paintings and work in progress and questions with me and a bunch of other artists that are in there and you can send me a private message as well as just joining the actual server and participating in there. There's lots of tutorials shared and things like that. Aside from that you can always send me a message here on be hands. There's a messaging system through this website so you could message me here if you think of something. When I'm not streaming and you have a urgent question photo shop or at question. That's that's fine. You can message me here. I also stream on Twitch, I do digital painting on Twitch on Tuesdays and Fridays, so if you. I have something to ask me. I might also be live at that time just on another another platform so. You can ask me there too if I'm if I'm live. You're from Brazil own ice. Pink colours plugin has much more features. Yeah, I mean pay that's why they are charging for their thing, right? You know they design then have been up keeping this so it's not free. I do think they have a trial and there's a discount code, but Tulip coolers is, uh, something have to purchase. and I do think it's worth the money. Personally has been for me, I've been using. I paid for it once I've been using it for years, so I've been happy with it, but there may be other similar types of color wheel plugins that are free. I don't know if they would have like all the same. You know things that color is has, but. Can we look around? There's a lot of different ones out there now. I've heard people talk about a chameleon and stuff like that. Yeah, it's you definitely get your moneys worth, especially if you're using it for a long time like what I have ended up doing. I think I bought my cooler is back in like. 2014 or something like that, like I've been using it this whole time so. Yeah, definitely was worth it. Oh yeah, I almost forgot that I was working on this plant. I got totally. Extracted OK. So let's see, I'm going to lock the transparency. So that means this shape that I created. I'm going to press this little checkerboard icon up here and then I'll be able to paint easily within this shape so I can quickly give a little bit of shading or highlight everyone. I think of it. I'm a little bit of color to these individual leaves. So this is like layer one. I want to do one more layer of leaves would be a little more natural I think, and some of the leaves have for yellow on them. So little little plants next to it. Also make a bunch of selections here. Just holding shift. OK. So let's do layer 2. So now we can get some more of these, add some foreshortening, some leaves that are kind of angled towards us. See how this looks. So I've got selection. Pick a nice green, yeah, not bad. If you want for the ones that are kind of coming out from the plants you can give it a little shadow. Towards the center where it's going deeper. Yeah, we can add that little bit of yellow stripe to some of the leaves. That's fun, isn't it? It's a bit intense, but I think I like it. So we can do the same to the little one, or we can have them be two different types, and maybe this one doesn't have the yellow. I think I like the yellow though. Let's let's do it. All right? So I think I like this overall, although the this spot I feel like I should make it a little bit darker. Yeah, that was a little bit more in the Shadow and we're having kind of the same issue with the pots as with the chairs earlier they need a little bit of shading underneath of them for it to feel a bit more convincing. I think that they're really sitting on the ground, so. Will put some little shadows and maybe blend them in after, so I'm just going to pop them in here first. And then. Maybe we can do a little blending 'cause it seems kind of. Stark. Little shadow behind them on the wall. Yeah, that's true for a lot of things. We're including Workflow. Sometimes you make decisions about how you work based on what's comfortable to you sometimes. People will suggest so you can do it better this way or easier this way and. It's always good to consider those things. So it's good to be willing to try something new, but if you're if you're really more comfortable doing it the old way and you're able to still get a good results and everything, sometimes you do things the in a longer way, for example, because you like to do it that way, and that's OK too. You have to be comfortable in your process. You have to be having fun. I think that's also important. Results are important, but enjoying your work is important too, especially in the long run. I'm going to put a little bit of warmer light on the tree. The tree is getting hit with really really bright light and in my version I didn't quite go. That far with it, but I think it looks nice. And it it makes sense based on the chairs and everything else the light shining on, it makes sense. This tree. It's getting. Some little splashes. This is fantastic that I caught the live feed high Adam, thank you. Having so much fun with your Ghibli brushes, their amazing thanks. So you're very welcome. And thank you for purchasing them. I'm really, really glad to hear you like them and you're having fun with them. Thanks for joining the stream too. I can show you and anyone else who is kind of getting here. Now I'll give you a quick recap of the painting process. We can go back in time I tried to save and you knew layers every so often. So I tried to build this up a little bit more like a traditional painting because I wanted to get that kind of look at the end result that it was more of a pain through painterly feeling. So I'm pretty happy with it. Overall, my complaint at this moment. Is. Everything seems very like over on the left and I think maybe I could try zooming in a little bit. Do you guys see what I mean? Like I feel as if it's just. Everything is too. There's too much blank space. So maybe zooming in a little bit feels better. And also maybe I can do something more with the shadows on the ground over here to help direct RI back in towards the right, like have the shadows kind of pointing back in on the grounds. Maybe I could add some little random leaves on the ground or something. There's some dead leaves, you know, just it's a bit stark. I think the pavement, the patio pavement. Maybe I could add more texture to it. The the pavement has a lot more little grooves and things in it than what I currently have, so those are some ideas. Let's try first with the shadow. So there's a shadow coming in. I'm going to do a little smudge. On it. Maybe lower the opacity. It was easier for me to paint it in pretty dark so I could see clearly, but I don't think it needs to be so dark. Let's flip. Good call. Thanks Ryan. Little shadow there and we kind of do the opposite, so that's overlay mode so I can also add highlights with it, and I think making that little splash of light back here at tiny bit more dramatic might also be fun. Hey clever. Been lurking in and out. It's been interesting to see this like you captured in the layers. Real pretty outcome too. Thank you. Yeah, I hope I can maybe upload that little step by step thing. At the end. I don't always remember to take little steps. Little. It always remember to keep those aside. But I was able to remember today. But thanks, I'm glad you find it interesting and that you like the results. So far. I'm trying to pull it together here with like the last little things to make it feel complete. I hope your day is going well. Now I'm like second guessing five zoomed in too much. I think it's fine, it's probably fine. Let's put a little bit more light here. I was trying to do that with overlay. It didn't really work. Let's try linear Dodge. I put my. Brush and my. Layer blending mode on linear Dodge. Do you choose not to include the sign on the wall because it would look better without it? How do you decide what to include or not? That's a good question. Uh, so for me. There's a few things that can help me decide. Sometimes they just go with like, my personal preferences are instincts like. If I think something, it might be really distracting to have in the scene, or just didn't look great in the reference. Or I don't mind this sign. I just. It didn't seem super important to me, and it seemed kind of it wasn't like really, really pretty. It's not like ugly either. It's blue. It's not really bad color, but sometimes when I'm painting scenes I leave out some of the man made elements that are not so aesthetic like signs or a little garbage bins or something like that. Sometimes I'll add them and sometimes not. So a little bit of romanticizing the scene, I guess, but now that you mention it and I'm looking over there, this the sign might be a really nice way to bring in a little bit of the blue over to the left because it seems very very like. Blue, blue and then pink side side. So maybe the maybe the sign would be nice to add. I didn't add the bicycle because I felt like it was getting a little bit too busy with the bicycle overlapping the chairs and I've got the chairs just worked well enough as a focus point so. I didn't include the bicycle on purpose. I think the sign I might try adding in you can tell me what you think. If you think it looks good. Hey, Machiavelli, welcome. Yeah, I just go with instinct and trial and error. Luckily because this is photo shop and not a traditional painting, I can easily just try something and see if it looks good and if I don't like it then we just gone. Out with the layer. Wow, that's intense. Let's try a little darker color. Hi Tyson Alright, well my sign is not necessarily the same proportions. As the one in the reference. But I can just scribble in something that looks like text here. What do you guys think? Do you think it's too intense? The color might be. Let me lower the saturation a little bit. I don't know if it's just doing too much, but I think I like it. Uh, I'm not sure. I'm going to try making a layer on color Dodge and adding a little bit of highlights on to it. So that it kind of matches the area around it. Maybe that's it's looking out of place because it doesn't have any highlights. Thank you Tyson, that's very nice of you. It looks realistic. You like the sign? OK Harry, I'm really glad you asked about the sign. We gave it another chance because of your question. I think it helps bring the blue into this side of the canvas 'cause it was a bit we were missing that there's two things I did that started eliminating blue from this side of the scene. One is the. One is the I didn't put in the little garbage cans. There's like little garbage cans. Maybe I can add just one of them. Well, I think that's what they are down here. The got little garbage cans. They have a little plastic. On them like a white plastic, but look at how blue. The shadow is. Look at that. Look at that blue and then look at the blue reflection on these. I didn't get these plants in yet, so. All of that missing blue. That's definitely yeah. If we add that in, it helps to tie it in. OK. So maybe I can use the eraser to give these little. Kind of crazy details the trash can has all these little swirly mesh details. Like the addition of the blue and pink, but it might be a bit vibrant. Yeah, it's a bit intense. I think it's partially because my pink was like so so bright here. Maybe if I. Turn it down a little bit. Jackson says looks amazing. Maddie here's my take. Well, thank you first of all, and let me check it out. I went with a bicycle. It looks so good. This is a really strong one, Jackson. What a cool choice. You get one of the chairs in the table, but focusing on the bike and what are beautifully painted bike, I can't believe you did this in such a short time I really love it. Love the color dynamics. Brushes beautiful feeling of light shining through. Is awesome. Really really nice work. Thank you for painting with us. Yeah, it definitely feels complete. Alright, let's add little bag on top of here. So there's two little garbage cans. I'm just going to add 1, but I'm trying to figure out where to put it. I think that's fine. That's fine. There. So that brings in a little bit of blue, and then we'll have some little flower pots on the table. I think I might select. I might just use the lasso tool to select the shape of little pots. That's going to be easy way to get a nice sharp shape. So I got 1 two. Paint those in. And they are metallic, which means they reflect a lot of light from around here and every other color that's around it so. Can color pic from the wall. Like mostly Gray. But with a nice blue. Reflected light. And these are kind of recognisable little pots they have. This common pattern of a little little rings around. I think a lot of us have seen these types of little flower containers. So something like that. Not too crazy and then we can put a little planes coming out. These little details I think you know they take time, but it really helps the scene feel alive and. Cheerful little flower pots on the table is a. Worth the effort. Hi Richard. Welcome. Still going to paint in some. Green leaves. I'm going to go. To a lighter, warmer color, green working their way up. Love painting plants and. I really like the effect of. You see, with like the warmer green at the top and then in the shadowed areas, there's always going to be some cooler greens and little blue reflected lights and things like that. I also have a. I have some brushes that have little leaf effects so could also use those. But sometimes for a little situation like this, it's nice to do some of it hand painted. Unique, unique look. Thanks Mina Horse. I'm ready to put in some bright pink Flowers on the table here. So I'll grab the back to my basic brush and we want a nice. Maybe we can sort of tie in this. Yeah, this bright pink. Oh, that makes me really happy. So cheerful. I'm going to add more Flowers than what it actually has in the picture. Ah. Look at that. Perfect. Thanks a lot of the challenging reference, but I enjoy painting along. Love how you turned out. Now I can look at it much more calmly and appreciate even wear your brushwork. Thank you. Know you're not a rushing along next to us. Thank you. 1 area I didn't get to do yet which needs some. Love is over here on these these windows. I gotta paint the bars in here so I'll do that on the separate layer. Alright, I'm not going to go for the an identical look to the reference, I'm just going to try to make something that looks nice. I'm going to put some different thicknesses to the window bars. Hi Jay, as I call you, how are you? Even that might be too not enough space in between them. Hum. My Windows didn't really come out the right proportions. Let's make these little smaller. Oh, welcome back. More near sorry about the tech difficulties for you. Some holding shift to make these lines perfectly straight. It happens to be. It's really handy that. The angle of my. Photo and everything. It works out that I can just hold shift sometimes. It's not so easy to use that. And it works out perfectly here. I might have to alter this color. It might be a little too dark for this area that I'm painting it right now, but I'm just going to worry about shape first. Just put in detail and then we'll go back and. Worry about the color. Missed last 10 minutes. Well, we did some details on the Flowers and stuff, but you came back at a good time. Danner Pride Hi Welcome. How have you been? Trying to consider the perspective and like roughly what kind of angle I should have for these windows. These little details. There's also some little swirls and things I'm just going to be really casual about scribbling them in. I don't think we need to be super precise for us to get the feeling of what kind of designs this would be, you know. Just some simple little swirls. There we go. Thanks red. Thank you, thank you Dana. My reference images in the description below the stream if you or anyone's curious, check it out. It's a really pretty scene, so I've enjoyed painting a lot. The only part I didn't really enjoy that much was painting the chairs. The chairs felt a little tedious, but. Otherwise. This has been one of my favorite ones to do here, I think. All right, before we merge this, I want to take the opportunity to paint any extra things below that. So I'm going to be merging the other things we did. But below the. Bars that a time where I can say OK. There's a. There's an extra little. Detail here, they didn't paint in before. Little bright highlight. So once we merge these down, it's going to be harder for me to pay anything behind there. So I'm going to lock the transparency. And grab a lighter color. Color of the. Light hitting these bars whoops. And just paint that on top. I've gotta find the right colour though. It's going to be really bright. That might work. It's not fun, so it's not going to be everywhere, it's the dappled. Lighting is also hitting these, so if you want to add some, leave some areas darker than that works. Do the whole thing Bray, this all pretty bright. And then over here it's more of a dappled situation. The green probably should be later. Over on this one, there's just so much bounce like going on even. Even in the shadows it should probably be a little later than what I had. Alright, that's better. The chairs, that's why only painted one ha so smart. That's what I should have done. Who? Yeah, so lightning up some of that a little bit. Selecting the wrong brush. Oh, good luck red. Have fun. I hope it goes well. Thanks for hanging out. Alright, I'm going to merge those down now. What can we do to finish this up? I think the floor we can add some more. Brush work down here. So there's not much interesting going on. In this on the floor, so there's there's some little dried leaves and stuff, but I'm hoping that maybe I can make some interesting paint strokes. This is supposed to look like more like a traditional painting. So I'm hoping I can when I'm painting in some shadows and things here on the ground that can maybe make some interesting marks that might help it somehow. I have some canvas textured brushes but I don't know if that's a good direction at this stage in the painting 'cause there's. Not a lot of it elsewhere. Do you think it might be one of those situations where I need to come back and take a fresh look at this? After a little bit of a break for me, the painting is just about finished. I wanted this to be a study. This isn't the Super super polished piece and I'm pretty happy with the lighting and everything. So what I might do is, after last little little touches I might end it here and then. After a little bit of a break, come back and look and see if maybe I get some different ideas with the floor and I can do something just a little spiff it up a little bit, but at the moment. I don't not really getting too much. Love the Dappled Light. The scene is so great. Odd, dappled light. Thank you James. Maybe maybe I could add some more light onto the floor. Maybe that would be interesting. So floors just got nothing going on right now. I probably should have thought of that issue earlier, but for some reason in the reference image it doesn't bother me. But maybe I can add some little. Flashes of light on the ground. Somewhere. Like leading in towards the. I don't know if it feels believable. I don't know. Thanks, Harry, thank you. I think I will leave it as it is for now and then. I might I might go back and add some dappled light or something. I'm just going to take a fresh look at it. Susan says. Looks finished to me. I think it could be finished. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it or not. But Yeah, I think I think I might end this one here for now. So from the beginning we could skip through this real quick. It was a different kind of process for me. Usually I sketch before getting into the painting. It worked out pretty well considering I didn't do a sketch beforehand, like we didn't end up with anything super super out of place. Sign it package called done. Cool alright yeah I will. When I when I when I look at this one and decide it's finished I think I'll post this one here on be hands think I like it enough that I'll post it sometimes they don't post all the studies that we do. Thank you Dana Project, a tiny one. Very small. Thank you JS, thank you. Machiavelli. Yeah, I'll post this on my probably my Instagram and my account here so you can see the finished one. Go get that cup of coffee that sounds good. Thank you so much. This was a really fun stream. I enjoyed the painting a lot. I think this is one of my favorite ones to do here so. Thank you for all the nice comments and company. I really appreciate it. I stream here every Wednesday. This stream is actually like a little bit on the shorter side. I might stream a little bit longer next time I like to do generally like to do a couple paintings, sometimes one, sometimes 2, sometimes 3. I did enjoy the workflow, it was very. It was fun. It was fun to work like this without the sketch.", "duration": 8342.499999999969, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url":

'S now streaming. And How do I do? OK. Good good good. Now. Uh I can hear myself. Is that really happening? I like it. As good OK that means where we have audio and we are ready to get started. How are you doing? Everybody let's go to the set up page minimize an let's go this is he should be able to see me and you should see me right here. And I want to thank you for being here with another cool live stream 2020, I missed January, 1st by 30 minutes. But it's still kind of the first day of 2020 and uh. We're going to count it. Alright cool alright. Was that background looking like a little crazy. I'm sorry about that. Uh but I'm glad you're here alright so if you guys gonna share. Yes, on comments on feedback. Please leave it in the chat? Where is the chat? Let's see is all the way on that side? And, of course I will answer I will respond. I'll take the time, like, at a screen over here. I can see what's happening. I am DTM that is DTM and you can find me anywhere on the Internet Instagram Twitter Facebook. Tick Tock, an patrion. My mission is to reach emerging artists who want to learn the art of digital and that means on the surface on the iPad on any tablets in T or machine where you want to learn some digital artwork. I use a lot Adobe products. Fresco illustrator photo shop and so on, plus sketchable. When I'm on the surface and today I'm on the surface and I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and get fresco started. So what that's going. I can take off this uh. I have a surface right here. All right. And let me turn that down a little bit. 'Cause I don't need to hear myself. And you guys can hear me right let's see. Yep, there, it is I can hear myself cuckoo cuckoo, so there, we go, We Gotta. Fresco. What's up fresco? And. We have a need to start a new document OK. I'm getting myself situated here. Yes, so let's go ahead and take this type cover off. And more over here. Got my Surface Pen in my hand. An let's go ahead and start a document here. Let's see current screen size. Sure, let's go with that what I like about Adobe fresco when I'm drawing with Victor brushes. Is that it doesn't matter? What size my screen is going to be my art board? Because I'm going to use vector brushes. I'll be able to export to illustrator and then scale to whatever size. I want an so most of the time, but I'm really looking for is uhm. The shape the size. Not so much the size of proportions. Of the Document let's see so we're going to go with digital and I'm gonna go ahead and go with square, yeah, yeah that's better OK cool and done. And that's it. COO COO COO so now let's go ahead and get started right, I started in a live stream earlier today. And today being January, 1st whereas right now is actually generous 2nd. But I haven't gone to sleep so still the same day Alright still one day. So I started to stream on Facebook. And uh what I did was I did a sketch in Sketchable. And let me turn this down further so I don't have to hear myself as much. I do have the headphones because I need to have the microphone alright so, so satellite stream. And I got a new folder there 2020. And I finished the sketch and Sketchable. Once I finished in Sketchable, I did a couple of drawings and schedule and this is the one that I was working on. We're starting off with something much simpler. Oh no, you crashed. I am going in and I am grabbing through these colors from these photos. Couldn't take it, I did, too much? And so when I started this sketchable. And I am using them sparingly. I did a screenshot and boom now, I'm going to work in the vector drawings yes. I'm using them to create new illustrations. Now. Part of the reason I do this is but it has a bar as a bird to heed what's up, man, welcome to the stream. I was live on Mattel and look. I was. Live on Behance. I'm doing this because it's it's like a really good way to start a really good way to come up with ideas. Jesus. Sorry. Yes, Sir No. And you know, and it really helps me, kind of. OK, OK, OK there. Boom. Really understand how color schemes work together. Alright let's get back. Here we go. If you're on here and you're watching them, and I know that you're on here, and I know that you're watching this, 'cause otherwise you know Jonah in the Woods. And so I was live streaming. And so you can go to my Facebook. The creative genius. Happy, heard or seen by anybody. And check out the stream. Then you probably shouldn't art and you're interested in color as these things kind of go hand in hand. And it might be something wrong with this uh this uh. I will admit that when I was, uh. Huh. But but, uh, we college student. I kind of wasn't that interested in color. My dad screenshot. Alright let's go here is go there. I kind of like really interested in like black and white illustration or or 3D design, and it was only interested in painting or anything like. There's a The one of these full screen snips. I deeply regret this. I think part of Maine knew that I would regret it. So that we cannot try to find a way to avoid that problem. Oh, I need to show my Smart Tools. Watched. I here we go and so I did this whole sketch on sketchable, funny right sketch sketch ibal. Which face? Extensions will timeline as set this up real quick so that you guys can follow along with me on the goals. And uh. I did it on a live stream on Facebook that I'm trying to get my point out. Our tool capture. And uh and so I did all that on Facebook. There we go. Became more bigger, we'd begun. I have a video. It's up online right now. Facebook.com forward slash dot creative genius, an now I'm going to. I kind of skipped past it and I wish I had stuck with it now. Um? But in doing these it really loosens me up. Come on here, an uh. It takes me do things that it teaches me about. Be hands. One of those things that you came here to learn about which was color. An work on this illustration. And dumb. Because colorism, mystery and the way it balances is a mystery and often really good art just hits us. And work on a double fresco and then from here, I'm going to take it too. Illustrator so let's see what's going on. And it's just like. Is spectacular and it kind of draws us in in grid art. Come on, it's not the computer 'cause I got 16 gigs of Ram I pulled. Can be alluring and. And you don't know why. As it turns out, it's offered through use of composition and color. And now it's time to to have a drag. This is. Maybe too much could it be too much less not use that. To welcome you this my stream about color about opposition. Document this could make a new one. There it is square this call is something. And we're going to experiment. It's gonna call this. We're going to play around and we're going to see what it is that we really like about this mysterious thing called color. I am S. A art battle. And how we could potentially wield it in interesting ways. Boom. Save it. To do this, to start off with, I am grabbing colors from this. Alright cool alright. We started we started fine now let's see if we can import this file. Image here. I had made a new. And I'm just experimenting with applying these colors onto my own. J pay here we go boom OK OK. The stretch, it out a little bit Oh yeah, then there's something wrong with that. Pallet now you might notice some similarities in general composition because I'm kind of drawing some compositional ideas from this, but in general I am not. PNG an now we're fine with this JPEG alright. We're still rolling Alright. If you stay here, with me. Hey Raja, Ratha nom Roger? Creating That was him seeing on the screen I in this little picture in fact. How are you? Thank you for joining me on this live stream sorry for not knowing how to pronounce your name but I am glad that you are here. Shortly I'm going to remove this. I mean, shortly. I mean within like a couple minutes. I'm going to remove this image. Alright let's go if you hear an echo in my voice, please say something. Is the great over here. Let me uh I should check I should check somewhere else over here, I'm going to check. And we're going to paint paint freely, and the idea here is going to be basically really checking out like what are these colors? See if I can hear an echo. How do you actually interact together and How do I use these colors in one of my own compositions? Yeah, I see. Because it's hard to tell. To create something original and cool. Man, I don't want there to be an echo windows streaming. Never before seen. That's my jam. But thank you all for joining me hello the days maker. Jimmy jam That's where we're at. Thank you for joining the live stream and doing some. So if you are one of these 16 people in this room, or again, maybe some 16 people, maybe just dying or 10. Are you a check right now? Let me see if this works, I can hear myself. I can tell because I don't know how to read this counter. I'm very loud. I'm going to choose as soon as the higher number 'cause That's more exciting to me. And let's go come on. But I want you to join in. So I'm going to draw with Adobe Fresco, an working on a character right now. This is going to be really fun, I'm like. Pretty aunt to get into this. Oh, there, it is I am live. And uh we go. I do this one yesterday. Much more kind of kind of like. , Come on presco. Basic Browns with blue and I base it on this picture here. It's taking awhile to show up. Um again, I don't have. Right here on this. Other Phone. Much of an agenda as to the ones that particularly use what's up. But I'll leave it, there for now, OK so. Awesome nikolina low. This is what I have, I have my character. Welcome to the stream. And I brought it in as a. I'm kind of just at the moment I'm going to nature to try to. Figure out because nature has what we humans sometimes lack, which is complexity. Picture, which is on the left hand side of Adobe fresco. If you have not downloaded Adobe fresco. I'm an hour ahead. And things are always a little bit more. You're missing out so you need to come on with it with it. Is this more variety of colors and we kind of assume there would be etc. Behind I'm in Alba behind or ahead. Let me see if I can now. Is this is this is this dyslexic? Ah. So it's really good places heart because basically any given photograph will yield any number of colors. Still, not showing up wine at Camera. Is this is that what that means when you confused whether something happens an hour earlier, an hour late is that dyslexia, whatever that is, whatever The thing is, where you're not entirely sure if something's Oma. And with any number of colors will provide you so much. I don't see it OK, so download Adobe fresco is free. Like information to kind of invent and creates, you know from there. There's some things in there that you're going to like me personally, I'm all about the vector and the reason I like vector brushes because you can export it to illustrator as a PDF whatever file you working on export as a PDF open into illustrator boom vectors. On one end or the other? Exceed C I'm also following here. I'm making up the Instagram incident. Jonah Goof is Tigran incident of 2020. Anybody know what I'm trying to say? Don't you understand what I'm trying to say in the hair is I need a haircut. It Wicks Texian Journal Lobe. You can see all your anchor points. I think everybody's kind of in that boat. And it ever be rectified, used to say. You can see all your paths and handles everything all of that is good to go. But this is a start. What's up? It's awesome. It's amazing. I love it. Awesome call Dixie has a burger. Alright so if you guys can hear me in Simi. What can I say what you say? I will be painting some more studies. That's cool if it sounds a little weird. Yeah, this is great and welcome to everybody else who's here. Please let me know 'cause I cannot monitor for some reason all right there, we go. Will be drawing some more studies. So. This is what we came up with the last week or Friday of last week. I'm going to go ahead and if you notice, if you look at my key pallet, I'm kind of just doing a lot of color sampling. I'm gonna keep on rolling keep on rolling Alright. So here we go, we got my sketch, which I could have done in Adobe fresco. Right? I'm holding down the alt button and just color sampling these, and I'm trying to get like just I'm trying to pick up. Um? But I really like the feel of Sketchable is so and I like going live. Colors and I'm distributing them kind of across the board a little bit across the whole scene a little bit. I really wish I didn't. Oh wait, I think oh I know what you did. And showing off my process so I'll jump on Frisco or sketchable. We still do have the. The line drawing it's great and you can tell where I painted on the wrong layer. And I'm doing it with a little bit of movement. Fresco is available on the iPad and the surface, but Sketchable is only for Windows 10. But I'm playing nearby that is. So we're going to do more of this. So here we go turn down the opacity when it comes to my sketch go ahead and select the layer where I'm going to start my drawing. This is this is one would do more of. I'm creating movement across across my palette, so this is not quite a landscape peace. And then you do that kind of stuff and then you do this. I have my vector brushes selected all right. And then you go into that and then this and that and this and that and that. UM hoops But I am having it follow some kind of landscape E feelings. It is the basic round. I like that brush and I like that. It supports on pressure, however, with this drawing. I don't want any thicker thin lines any variation in the lines. So that is to say it seems to have some kind of Horizon Line. Junk from my. Just want to traffic. Past the middle here. I just want a solid. And then and then I have one of these. There seems to be some kind of paling of light. And then one of those and that's that, right? Line the stays consistent throughout my drawing so I'm going to see if you can see that now my face on the way so let me go ahead put this over here. But it's a little unclear, right? It's like what's what's, what and that's fine. And then earlier what's in here? And actually it's very much my intention is I don't want to create anything that looks like anything else at this moment. We did this guy with this poor back. And then before that is this lady with. Pressure dynamics i'mma turn that off and what happens is that now is not doesn't. I that are same color or nothing. I'm open to that. Well, I guess not the eyes but the whites of the eyes are the same color as the background and it just makes it like it just makes it look like a cut out or something. The line does not change in with. I'm very open to that and if if we go along and we start basically that that's kind of ends up being what we start doing. An it doesn't respond to the pressure that I'm putting on my pin, which is good. That's great, like we start inventing new things, but at the moment I find it is something intensely gratifying and kind of subtly. That's what I want I mean, it's up to you to choose what you want? Something to note for future studies I guess is to not have the whites of the eyes. How you want it and let me see what that shows that shows angle roundness and so on, but now I'm going to go ahead and there's a smoothing. Me. Not have the whites of the eyes the same color as your background. Both both learn things about art and learn things about myself and what I can do with art. I mean, the kind of are. I never paid attention to their smoothing. I wonder if it really gets a little. Even in the rest, never here for all heads twisted up too much and that's why I never liked going well. When I do exercises like this so often, what I'll do is I'll kind of grab these certain colors and I'll put them in somewhere like if I just, you know, if I just experiment with what is it like to have just look up little speckles of orange over here? Jagged and you're so on. I guess it's there's. When mine. There's a benefit, it's beneficial of going back and looking at your old work for for exactly what you just saw happen is like you notice your you know, is how awful you are truly and that you should you face with two clear choices to give up or to keep studying and observing in this stream, we're going to try and favor the one where we keep pursuing. When I'm drawing alright so let's get that 8 take it down to 2, 1/2 and test out the drawing. I'm going to put away the layers by clicking on the layers icon and then let's see let's see what happens. It's pretty cool. It looks a little bit like splash off from everything else so. Reply that I can see what that does for Maine. Well, that's OK. I like that. And you know. I'm going to make sure that it looks like a drawing that's what I want. We don't know yet like what they will yield or if it will look natural in the grand scheme of things. And that means that I wanted to have not to be super perfect. But Am I concerned about that? Working on getting better. That's what we're going to try and keep our our attitudes focus on. I don't want it to be perfect. Create a little bit more of his breakage. I don't want the lines to be super perfect. It doesn't take away the fact that there's always this impending presence. Some of these lines when I first laid these colors down, some of them were very hard. If I want to super straight lines and I would use Adobe illustrator front when it comes to the vector lines, there, it is very cool look at that. Of you should just quit and we can. Edged them and very soft edge and I'm going to be blending like this. I have no issues talking about this type of stuff and how to deal with it now. And I'm telling you we're gonna sit here and work on this tonight. Just color sampling from the area, blending, pulling that color him and see what happens when one things bills into another. Not to deal with it. Let it completely. And when I say we I mean, I mean me. Overcome you. Is often we get these very cool. Um, from time to time I think the trick is. But we're gonna work on this annual see how. Movements. I. And it's something from Batman. When we do that. Open this in illustrator, an it'll be vector. And also rocky to write rocky. Sure. All right, so let's go, like this. Is when you're at your lowest of lows, and I guess this is. There we go now like that, I need to be like this. You know this might be universal, could apply this kind of. I know what that sound is. Yes. Hey girl, Oh yeah. I don't know if you can call a technique, it's just it's just a sentence that I say to help find a little glimmer right of potential. Uh-huh sure let's call it there. I don't know part of the background sound little town. I still have a project that I'm working on that I haven't finished I will go live again tomorrow. Hope that things will get better is that. I'm gonna show off some. Hope now I can't. Of some of these sinking lower line. Children's book coloring book. Now he just made my glasses even worse. Um? An page design PDF set up an illustrator. Hold on my drawing. Gloves are here that were just cleaned. You don't like this look at their. Maybe they will be good at cleaning as well now. Haha. Yeah. No, I think it's 'cause the glasses are too greasy. I want. I like this. From my nasty face. There you go Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And it's just like making, yeah, it's just. An if I don't like this mouth and I'm going to outline it. It's just basically combing combing the grease. In some of them. It's actually made it really blurry. Alright transform and then move it. I don't know if you guys can see this. Now you can't really see it. Nice too far I cannot. Yes, it didn't have to move a whole lot. I'm just going to deal with it again for now. I'll take it. But just enough done. One of the thing. Put away the. Layers and then go here. Hello, what happened. No yeah, I know I need to go back to my. Vector brush. OK. OK. I'm doing like a live stream. I don't like that. Let's go, like this see. Now I can come out like that. There you go, that's what you want. Uh-huh. And the head is kind of large so let's go ahead and. People, people moving in next door. But I wasn't as this woman in Bolivia who. Still, there. Any more square angles and so don't wanna. Work next door. Choose mosaicist she moved elsewhere on this floor. And so she just moved out. And so nobody had the spot, but apparently literally like two days later, AKA today. I was that note. Let's go, like this. The moving in. I have neighbors again. There is much better, I do want straight lines. More straight lines. They're just moving in large amounts of art supplies. Lesar. Round lines here with this. OK let's go, like that bone. Alright, so. Yeah, yeah, we're going to make it really, really hardcore rough graffiti like. I like them. What's going on with the values here with like these kinds of this, this kind of white. This white light here and I think that's. And Daddy like I'm gonna leave all the little dots. That's what's going to do after me and I feel like it really creates this feeling of Sky. You get end up with a lot of dots when you rum because you're the screen that it's going to. Much of what it is. It's kind of doing it, but it's kind of like giving a cloud or something. I'm not sure I'm going to kind of go with that. The your Palm and your fingers in your hands are going to leave behind little dots little artifacts because of the way. Over here. Like ends up in general, like up here, not entirely, but just like into these kinds of blobs. And then refresco works on the surface, so let's see I don't like that. Um? And then that way I can hopefully create this really cool dramatic like. Uh-huh. OK, we got that this to the other eyebrow. Sky Sky scheme that necessarily isn't necessarily there in the actual picture. Uh-huh. Rio. But What is something of my own design? That one take it like that. Something I really like for that which I really want to pursue? If you check out that live stream that I did earlier today. And it's on my Facebook. Is. And if you've seen this movie, it's forget this MMFKZ it's on. This. Like kind of gradient gradients. So basically take these colors in the background. Netflix are mega shake it out. Here is sample that it kind of painted in, just gently and it kind of creates a feeling of like home. Very dumb. My to another one right here. No. So. And I do that, yes is today's lies. Um? Want to put this whole canvas? Oh yeah. Looks rough like yeah, this, this is seen it. I find especially when creating works far like this that are like kind of have these different they are like. Almost like like Scott, you like landscapes or whatever. These compositions that kind of are made up and kind of go in different directions. He seemed it. I sent it. If you don't flip the cannabis from time to time. You might lose out. There it is. Kind of on what on like on the way it slanted often what happens is that something apiece you draw it with your left hand, and then after a while you flip it and you realize, oh man, it looks like it's been drawn by somebody falling over to the right while I go to the left. I like it. I need a share this link and other places and tell people that I'm live. So yeah, go ahead and share the link. If you watch him if you watching and you like what you see say something. Say Hey, Dan, This year's kind of messed up face amid a little bit. Our arts they basically have a handedness, right? It could be left-handed, right-handed, etc. And if we don't put it back and forth, we're going to lose out on that. All right. Who? That like. Uhm I do wanna hear. Directionality right? So going forward, I want to focus a little bit on like the contours of the light. This girl like that. On the shapes of the shapes of things, basically so excited to create right now, where it's kind of a muddy. I can model of. OK. In a value in points and all that, I'm just going to start to try to smooth things out and I might not do that in the same way for every picture. I have a when it when it comes to Adobe fresco and before that, it was Adobe draw. But I'm going to be basically, but this one. I've kind of come into this place where I really enjoy these vector brushes. I'm feeling it because I like these big Boeing shapes like the movement of provides. Just like a They have. Certain style certain look that makes me draw in a particular style and I like this bold. I like it, but I'm also going to just pull them down. Kind of in movies lines in We do the same with the red and drag that around. Jaggedy or very organic looking our style. Now I could go zoom in in here and focusing on these little areas, but at the moment. Truly the best thing for me to do would be to zoom all the way out like I'm doing now. Say that So. And. Just kind of like get a feel for how things could be laid out. Can you This fixed. Oh got it. Huh. Because only when I kind of settle on a big. What was that Draw Something? Larger composition. Something fell over how we still live here with good good. Will I know for sure? OK, here, we go. What's working, what's not? And then when I know what's working? What's not then I can go from there and I can design an invent and expand. This again, let's focus on these big shapes. I like this kind of curling. Out is a movement away. Resumed out there we go. I just did what I said I wouldn't do, which is I've zoomed in. I like this and then I'm going to have this kind of even arcing out further across here. Yeah. Missing you gotta enjoy art. That creates this kind of like billowing cloud look. Enjoy your drawing. Oh my, my head is like all over the camera apologies. OK got that. Remove the camera back. There we go. And with this up. No. By the way, so we have about 40 people watching so far. No yes. If there are any questions at any point please. Let's go, like that, like that, like that. Don't hesitate to let me know I'm here to answer questions. Like that and like that and like that Anna. I'm here to hang with you. So, just chill. That was so nice about having live streams. So the next step is So what do you guys like listening to when you're drawing? Is it you don't have to watch this as if it was YouTube video you can answer questions, ask questions. What's your favorite music? You can say what's up, you can interact. You and I are hanging out together in real time. I used to really like, Alotta drum'n'bass. Guess that was the fair or something that was the thing right. Over here in the US is the 4th of July. Which is a holiday. But I'm working because I am an artist, there's no rest. To make to make. Fix my eraser. There we go. Or the broke as they say. And uh. But you can only listen to it for a few hours. Um? No, but seriously, though, I actually I have a one year old daughter and so the last year I haven't been able to get at the end to work as much as I like. You can't really listen to it all day. 'Cause then your head really starts to pound. So honestly, I relish the ability to go into the office and when I'm here on the Adobe Channel is that I get to do I get to come in and I got to make art and what kind of part do I have to make? But it's good for like quick pick me up like right now. Actually, what time is it in almost 1 in the morning in Atlanta? So I've been up. Nothing. I get to make whatever I want, that's what that's what Adobe reports. Uh since I've been in love. Mean has always had been doing honestly. Since 66 AM. And the I think it was 5:30 or 6:00 o'clock. If you don't know me, I'm not familiar with back in the day I used to stream on Adobe Twitch Channel. In any case. And. I've been up for a long time. Now I'm streaming here. But Yeah, Adobe is always. Literally, they've never. Once. 2019 hours. Told me what to stream. I cause that man. Something like that. We'll see what time we go to bed tonight, 'cause I need to finish this drawing. And they pay their people Z brush. This is a series we're doing some art competitions. I don't know if anyone here is familiar with the brush. That's a program. Not made by Adobe. Is so friendly? I quite like Z brush, but there people do not support the fans nearly as much or there. Friendly competition. At the Microsoft Store. They were like how we loved your work on the Adobe channel, which income stream for us, and I was like yeah, sure. How much do you pay your streamers? And they're like, Oh no, we don't pay. What's happening here we go? But you know, exposure. OK, So what you see is that I'm doing a lot of line were can I really like lines? I was like get get outta here get outta here. I like especially with pencils, but when it comes to the inking or in this case, the digital. I did it like once. It's like kinda find anything like didn't do anything for me. I'm like OK, I'm giving you free advertising. Vector then. I do like Line work. And they were very picky about how I did things etc. Not Adobe. And so the lines help you define the shape and form plus the volume of what it is that you supposed to be looking at. I worked for Adobe on a secret project, or. A year and a half after I finish streaming for them can tell you what the project is. There we go. To this day, I can't tell you. I worked with a great guy over there at Adobe who actually has since left he retired. Uh-huh. All right. So the hand is kind of long not fat enough. But But the really like the feeling there was really of like. I may bring some of that stuff in I just don't overthink it right now. Creativity, like reading tools for people like. Hi baby girl. Also, what I am going to do, however, is export, and in safe so let's go ahead and do one. I don't know, it was very. It was a very good bye. Bye God, you know you get like a lot of different vibes. Different companies in places you work but I was like. Quick export export as i'ma start battle. Like Adobe ICU. I see I like what you're doing. Version 1. I like this. Adobe headquarters, also in San Francisco, Yelp. Uh-huh. I want to export as PDF. Very cool. And then click on export. There we go let's go find Ms art battle folder there. And very cool people overall who they hire. When I was at a streaming for Adobe, this is Greg us. It is his safe is saving exporting. What's going to happen is that it's going to be a PDF, but these vector lines, you'll be able to. Who worked with the streamers? You know, we started off as kind of a general moderate are. You know, just kind of a nice guy helping out etc etc. Um. And by the end he was ahead of like you know the community there. Open an illustrator and they will be. Vectors you'll see will be able to see the arm. Now he's just moving on up and he's just like the friendliest dude. Always been nothing but like a joy to work with. I should actually. Um? Close the document. I don't know if you could tell they have some goodwill. Can we ever see them? His people. Anchor points. Alright, let's I really like to shave that accumulating appear. Cuckoo take it out come on, saving document. Let's create a little bit more movement down here so. You saw how I was a little. I'm using large line work. I'm using large line work. There's a reason that I'm not going into. There's a reason that I'm not going into. Uh. Uh. Hum. Hum. Into the specifics yet, or even even if I do. Into the specifics yet, or even even if I do. I mean, honestly, I probably would. I mean, honestly, I probably would. I'm going to do is I'm going to have maybe somebody in the audience. I'm going to do is I'm going to have maybe somebody in the audience. Find me a cool photograph of nature or something like that and I'll. Find me a cool photograph of nature or something like that and I'll. Recent Mark based on that. Recent Mark based on that. Maybe that would be fun. Maybe that would be fun. Down down, down. Down down, down. You'll notice also, by the way, how much I am color sampling. You'll notice also, by the way, how much I am color sampling. This is a little this this white spot here is a little much I'm going to go ahead and mute it. This is a little this this white spot here is a little much I'm going to go ahead and mute it. By basically kind of painting over it and then just using what's left over the paint over. By basically kind of painting over it and then just using what's left over the paint over. As what I'm working with. As what I'm working with. There we go. There we go. I'm kind of creating this streaking effect tours the center. I'm kind of creating this streaking effect tours the center. I'm not wedded to that. I'm not wedded to that. You know, there's things like this where it's like what is that? You know, there's things like this where it's like what is that? I don't know what that is that's kind of wild and crazy. I don't know what that is that's kind of wild and crazy. Um? Um? But I am creating this kind of like these lines that kind of seem to be converging a little bit more time towards the middle. But I am creating this kind of like these lines that kind of seem to be converging a little bit more time towards the middle. I like. I like. We think here. We think here. With this one more time, alright? With this one more time, alright? I think I like. I think I like. I think I want to movement like across. I think I want to movement like across. What like?

That's when I really start to feel. I want to do with you though, say hello and give me the follows. Certain brushes kinda underperform, but I I really have nothing to complain about. Now be enormously helpful to me and I'm going to keep ringing. You know? The bottom with antiques got a couple of areas that clearly look like I don't know. The art and the fund nahs. The answer is many questions, yeah. Is there new video? So in that video to a friend, and so on and so forth so they all get each other's version of the story until its totaly messed up and weird. Kool-aid, stains like maybe. Thanks girl. Fruit punch things thrown at Nora's name. I believe some of this tangerine down and around. And then they all watch it back together. It's just like how it's like the light bleeding up. It's real fun so I thought I wanted to do with Korean and Anthony and so yeah I just need to send the video which I have immediate Korean. From the projector. I don't know the hamsters behind. One of them died, exploded or something. Sorry sorry sorry I need to do that but this weekend has been really busy. It's built, it's kool-aid, whatever. There is a real freedom for me in this exercise. Inside of my centriq. I just got back from my mom and Dad's I did not like. It's not really hamsters that was a joke. I am very wedded. I was social distance from them which is really sad 'cause I wanted to hug my mom for Mother's Day. I don't know if I have to clarify this. 'cause it PG. There's no hamsters were harmed. To realism As an artist. But I did a drop off some homemade gifts for her and my sister, who is also a Mama. In the creation of this joke. I am dedicated so much of my education towards. And even then I don't really notice it too much. And so yeah, I just got back from that. Drawing things as they are. The purple. Beams coming up that's pretty. Or drawing things as in the most realistic way possible, and what I've come to understand over the course of Mycareer is. It is 5,000,000 degrees currin is it hot where you are? I mean like given, given the fact that I've had this since since 2013. But yeah, it's one of those or two of those days, but turns out to be a lot shorter than you want them to be. And that's like the worst wear and tear that I physically conceive. While that can be impressive in some regards, it is not necessarily. Uh. Money, kind of well spent. If you know what I mean. I guess. Maybe I don't know. Make for amazing art and in fact, although I get the more I think to myself, Gosh, I am learning a lot. I think I like this pose, but I could mix these other two really not feeling them quite as much. Yeah. That's a good one Anthony. It really is this one right here? All right. And it's just unfortunately you guys can't see the same. About how to do more with less and how to. But we'll see. We'll see how it goes. Same pictures that I'll be seeing. How to invent? Actually going to pull this one out. I'm going to be nude. Not myself. And not have to worry too much about whether or not the thing that I'm inventing is realistic. Size it up. Maybe later off stream, but these gestures are going to be nude an I think I'm going to just do 90 seconds 'cause I'm super rusty and I might even. Um, because it doesn't matter as much as is it affecting. 'cause I want her character sheet to have consistent sizing. If there's any fans of gate video games out there. Basically, this is just a. Want to do them longer than 90 seconds? And you might know what I'm talking about. A character sheet of like poses and emotions. You know? I mean some of your favorite games might not look realistic at all. Hum. So the goal here is just to kind of show her as a character, like give a few poses and expressions to really show like who she is, just by seeing her on a sheet. Alright, so let's do that. It's a top. And so many of these games that strive for realism. Back to this brush. Are not. Like that worth remembering, you know. Get down. So if if after all this you still have no idea like what her personality is, that's when I failed. Keeping smaller than that. How are the house the volume guys? So the goal is to show her as a character just through seeing a few key moments with her. You heard it here first folks. I did a little bit more. The real world is overrated. Missing around. With the. My settings. We can do that, then we're doing good, babe. The art direction in the real world is globally as best. Um? Every time I talk now, you shouldn't here. Oh excellent, MD designer says envoy para Brazil oh excellent, you're from Brazil. That's right, I said Flubby going to have a little bit of the Sky color just a little bit. Or in between me not talking. You shouldn't here too much. I'm guessing you're saying sorry? Just brush it in there and then the sample from there and go from there. White noise. I don't speak Portuguese, but I I'm so glad that you're joining from all around the world. And maybe even when I'm actually talking, you shouldn't hear too much either. I just want to create a little bit of. That is the coolest thing ever. Drama. I'm in Portland OR right now and the time is 6:55 PM, So what time is it in Brazil where you are, I wonder? Last week stream they added one filter on. It reduced. Alright, let's do this one more time. All the white noise when I'm not speaking, but when I'm speaking there still, I don't know why I hired a wizard to do something and I want to know if them waving their wander around is actually hitting me anywhere. And also we've got. I say we work on this for just a couple more minutes and then we switch over. Anthony said sounds like fun, Ryan says. To a new entirely new. That's a fun process all yeah and Kerin says it will be. Other schema an entirely new illustration. Sounds great OK, thanks Sam. It will be wonderful whenever is Grand and is quite pleasant out here. Where do you get your poses for? What is say? Your characters volume is good. What do you say you and me? Oh, I'm so glad I'm dying here. OK, where do I get my poses for my characters like? Let's do it. So hot. I'm just yeah. Is are you talking about like my own artwork characters? I'm real sensitive to temperature. Whenever it's cold, I'm freezing whatever it's hot, I'm sweltering. Adding a bit more edge flow. Taking those lines I just made and kind of just letting them back in a little bit. Like if you have something in specific that you've seen that I've created. It's not fair. Alright, well fill in little lumi. I can tell you where if I did get it any worse, but most of most of my list my proposes. Create a bit of visual balance over here. Maybe lumias on her shoulder in this one or something, I'm not sure. Little flow. Will have lumedia character on here as well, so sometimes they're interacting. Awesome will create these head of shapes. Are kind of rough gestures, just really rough sketches and then I find. Sometimes will be separate. If you make it look like. There will be like a little lumi up here. Landscaping. A lot of the times it's more than one post fused together right for reference. There are obviously things bumping up. You know? Maybe, oh what if he's afraid of other people in his hiding behind her leg and he's like word, what's going on out there? But OK, we already did circle. Yeah, if you do have like an image in mind, you're like where did you get this post? Where did you find this? Alright, I'm also going to. Cute, like a little kid. Trying. I love it. See, this is the fun part of like doing character stuff is just thinking about what they would actually do, like getting in the mindset. Fill out a little bit of that. Answer that as best as I could because I can. Going to bring. Attention. I just close the tab. Trying to use that color sparingly. Proposes. That's why I want to do more stuff like DND because it does force you to become other characters in your mind and like live how they would. There it is again. Yeah, so 90 seconds I'll do about 20. I find it very difficult to not do what I would do in a lot of situations. Like the other kind of the repeating Chiefs of this color, so I'm gonna keep that. And that's that's probably let me just hit start. Uh, so that's why I want to. I want to play with it more. I want to get better at it. Poses all nude 9020 yeah. It's very hard to role play. Effectively. Ryan said, did you see? There are 55 people. Alright, so 90 seconds. Shanghai Disneyland is opening tomorrow? Watching. Let's see what we can do here, man. OK, I hope it's ready for that. Presumably 15 are capable of speaking. I'm just curious you are next to your keyboard and you can. How many seconds is like? And if it is ready for that, then like good for that. Not enough time to do anything immediately. Say something. Cool, I really hope there's not a bad way. The first thing that I I'm feeling right now is a sheer panic. Give me a random word. Those people getting infected. Write down a random word. So I think I think that's. Grant says she seems free spirited so far. I'm just curious. Oh, that's great. Part of the getting back on the horse again. I'm glad I want her to be so free spirited and so ready to just like join the action. As an exercise. The. Used by the computer. Which is. Maybe some like good expressions where she's like curious or like this pose might be a little plane, but maybe we can spice it up with her arms doing something like arms are very evocative. Who feels like typing, listen and just just to be clear, you guys don't have to talk at all. Just gotta remember how to sit in the saddle. Look at that. First gesture back. Yes and just sit back and enjoy because I'm enjoying what I'm doing. Complete garbage. When you doing it. Oh, it turns out, 90 seconds is fairly long. Um? But it's just a little quiet alliance with dad today. And that's OK. My daughter, whenever she's feeling shy like how you doing there? How you doing? You want to say anything? Do usually warms up and said something like BA. Are blob. Like Cuckoo, Cuckoo? And here you're good. Buddy heard. Is working on learning things now learning. The language. It is one of our most proud accomplishments as a young speaker is. Confidence she just got. Would you like to not be able to apply them to anything except for the word? Yeah. Back This is how she makes. I pulled some of using this color and just create a little bit of. Echo. I like kind of like this, like feeling of like. This kind of feeling right? This kind of creates a little cool little. Movement. It'll echo in their poop. Yeah this is dope. I like this. This is really fun. And you see, this is this is, you know, very plainly, a nonsense piece of Art. There is nothing really going on here but our mind. My mind is the artist trying to lay down rules for how my new illustration world must work. And maybe your mind. Fills in the blank too, you know and decides. At there's. There's something going on here. Like it can almost parse the information. You know? Our brains try to fit. What we're seeing 2 dimensional form into some kind of three dimensional world, at least try to understand it in some ways and we can't totally. Uh. It can be either intriguing or frustrating. And you know what? This time it is. OK cool, I like this. This is very nice. Now we have these kinds of feelings, like almost reflections. Kind of you know. A Catherine Steel It's see Catherine. Catherine, I follow each other on Twitter after many years now. Nothing. How are you today Good Hope you're well, hope you're well. What are you doing something fun for the 4th but not quite? Equipped Do we fill out form? Real party. But Hope you're doing something. There we go. I like this. This is cool. This is, I like this one. This is a fun one is unlike usually what I'm doing. Watching the kids play. Oh yes, that's nice. Let me let me or this little bit more. As when I get bit more like yeah movement, there we go. And I like this kind of like mostly blood spill, choking, and the thing. So I'm going to go ahead and just push that. You know little bit I'm going to blend that little bit more 'cause I like that it kind of has a cool. Fact Like something is. Is blending in this water something is leading into his water? If it is, if indeed it is water at all, you know. There we go. This is cool. I like this one. This one should not fun. It doesn't always, although almost all I gotta say, almost always it does. Not my general art, but this particular exercise almost always turns out pretty cool. I wish are illegal in our city with city anyway. Oh good. That's funny that their legal anyway, but that's great. A huge relief. Um? Not even there's been some fireworks in my City, New York City. Right and I had just a few more gradients and I'm going to move on to create some bit of flow here. There we go. I like the movement the movement is created there. And maybe I know what this thing I'm going to kind of calm this out here. There we go, use these colors. Build something, yeah, just a little something different there. And then maybe I'll just use this kind of pay on this just to delete in there a little bit. There we go. There we go. OK, great. Cool. I like this alot. I'm happy with us. I'm going to another picture. Hope you don't mind. Let's go find the new ones. I'm going to grab my Pinterest page. I have a Pinterest page here which is a big fan of. If you like a cool things. I create Pinterest page for you. I have all kinds of cool things I got. Monster does decide reference. I got animal reference avani the secret folder you cannot access, sorry. Great art clothing design, bigger drawing. Oh, I got this is going to be coming with something else. Beautiful girls, aliens, awesome fan art of my art. At some cool stuff in here, but today I'm going to go into. I'm going to go into. I mean, I can go to any one of these folders and find something awesome. Let me let me figure this one. This is a very kind of cinematic. Oh, this is cool. This is like the exact same color scheme is what I just did. I like that a lot is right. I'm here today to pick up the kids in this week. It's been hard getting my son down. Regression goof. I'm a mom on the edge now. Oh no Catherine. I'm sorry. How old is your son? But he's in a progressive. That is rough, by the way, that is super rough. It is not easy. Ooh, I like this. That's cool. It may I might want to punch the values out a little bit. But it has a very different feel than what I'm doing right now, so let me just try, let me just bring it into our into our file. All paste it right here. I will punch out the levels a little bit, not much. There are eleven months now. OG of Twins. No, just your son. Um? That's yeah mine is 13 months, right? Yes, 1313 month old just turned one month ago. We didn't really do anything for her birthday because she's a baby. And that's it. Doesn't get anything if you're just a baby. Alright, so I'd like this. I like this new image here. I'm going to use this image. And I think it's any yield very different results. From a from a perspective of composition. So we grabbed my brush. Is it cold colors? We're moving on. When we got the new colours, here we go. I'm grabbing the screen. I'm getting this dark green. You know I'll put some of these screens on top as well, so they did not just the landscaping, more greens, more greens. You see how I just. I'm just randomly sampling. I like this path color. This is cool path color. And when I grab some darkness, some background, let's pottery. And then went to you. Bring in this the horizon or you have to have Twins, my goodness. That is Catherine. Honestly, I mean listen, you know, congratulations to you. It's a beautiful thing. But I was also like my wife. Like nightmare he was like I want to have one kid. I'm terrified having to. That sounds so hard. But you know what, though? The fact that there are 11, we've made it this. I mean 11 months old. If you made it this far, that's a great sign that's great. I mean, this is. This is the hardest, right? Like this is the hardest when they can't do anything from the cells. Although once you start running around I guess you're going to have your hands full. Whoops Thanks. But still though, it will be still be really super fun. Alright, so I've got these colors now. I've got this new assortment. Grab this thing, it is that there's a value there. Now I'm trying to not just grab these little black spots and I'll just put them here and there. You know these are like it's like. It's like reality, disassembled, you know. I like that. Might might have have. I don't want to have just horizon here. I want to have like some kind of action going to bring some of this green up. Up the side of the painting like this. Um? Alright, I'll bring green to the middle. I'll bring some of this more of these kinds of. And you see, I'm filling in the blue I don't want anymore that blue in there. Now as I go, you might think yourself. Oh, it was cool before, and now he's wrecking it, you know? Don't think that. We're just getting started. So here we have, oh, you know we have this kind of silvery. I might be the same color as the Sky, more or less. Let's say it's more or less the same color as the Sky. But the thing we have just just be aware of, so I'll put a little bit down there over this blue down there. Little bit of this other kind of blueish color alright. Cool. Now I'll hide the photo reference. I'll put this image a little bit. I will be going for something a little bit more. I don't just something different this time. A different feel though. I like this kind of tall. Earth monolith thing here. I like that yeah, I did that thing that looks cool and maybe I'll just end of butter. Sit by adding more. I'd like Aladdin one over over here. A short one right? And then I'll add one like here and maybe I'll make it slightly different. I'll add these ringtone out, total changes in them. Then here's we had this kind of like Mountainy things, but I don't need those. Be mountains, but I do like that you know The thing is when we use certain colors, turn value shifts and all that and we moving reference from photographs. Our eyes know what is an image from my balls, except for assemblage of. Color and light braved when we do the same thing. We bring the same thing into a photograph, and we bring in the same colors. Our brain might still parse these things at distance thing. So again, like grab more of the city stuff. City stuff kind of maybe in the middle distance. And then add that again. But I can now use these colors values to create a feeling of depth. Let me create if that kind of sales down through here. Hey, maybe I'll create multiple. Have there may be a little too symmetrical. Beware, symmetry is not always your friend. It's been a piece of Art. In fact, oftentimes symmetry and egg loot the power of a piece. This from this image. Despite this black here. Now if it is or not. But I don't hate it. Yeah. Alright, I'm going to continue to use. My background, I'll rate difference tall entities in the back. Then we start to create this pattern of repeating shapes. I think that would be cool. Skip this these cities in the back. OK. Yeah. Moving across the middle. OK. Way to continue to nurture these like high rise style. Gross. And this is exactly by the way, like how like you can create like really cool original like. Like doing something because it's fun? Sci-fi settings you know just by being like you know what. There's you have to if you want to do something yet to be the best at it, right? Let's just threw out the window rules out the window and play with colors and light data. That time you're like, oh look, I have made something. I tell you I'm not signed up, I'm not. I'm not subscribed to that way of thinking. Cool is Nicole. But if you're doing something you've got to be the best and you've got to go for blood or for the dollar sign or whatever it is. 8383 people watching right now. Is that right? I mean, is that really a TV watching? I'm getting distracted. I can't be put to feed in. Total views now. Still I don't know that means. Watching now 50 OK whatever. 1515 watching now I guess I would ask you. Anyways, my point, what I'm trying to say is that when you're working on getting better as an artist, and I guess this is my beats, this artist is is that. Thanks for being here. Yeah, I like I like. I like doing this kind of thing because of the fantasy creator. It like it, just it really does help me to like. Conceive of. And I'm really should practice what I preach is not to beat yourself up that you're drawing, specially your studies in your warmups. Things. And maybe I have never considered before. There we go. Are poop poop. Might take poo poo. Come home bum bum. I said it so. Gumball boom boom. And that takes time. Maybe that you know for more. I'll just get rid of the weight over here. For some people that might take more time. Although this might be kind of body of water kind of thing. Kind of get into our heads. I don't know if it's good for right here, but will figure it out right. And then some people. I like this is kind of like. I think the first thing that a lot of people need to do is and it's a very difficult one. I don't know. I think they need to be a little bit more intrusive, like a little bit more minor, these little Rd things. Is dropping the ego right? This is the color from the road in the original. Maine. Dropping the whole. Ended our little bit. No, this is just my unique way of drawing. I don't hate him. I kinda like Ahmad Sunshine. Figure out the best way to use them. You know if I've ever heard that from somebody. Come here. And we're talking about this is, I guess for this example, it's premature exclusive two talking about fundamental. Dario Elena Ravelo Riviera. Rivera Rivera Ola. You know I've had a couple conversations or run into a couple of people in my time. Yes. Tyrion. Yeah. And my Boomer time, whereas they don't believe in the fundamental few and far between my dad, these types of people. Where are you? Are you from Rosario? Thank you for coming. People who don't necessary believe in. The fundamentals of Art. Or really haven't. You know, maybe not believing them, but they've done once. I think I'm trying to figure out what is it the. The thing I'm going to go ahead and put like a around thing in here in the middle. It's kind of like a one and done in their head. And I personally don't think that that's your ever really kind of done with the fundamentals. Not that. Now you notice I'm not trying to invent basically any new colors. It's kind of like saying that one day you won't need to use paint for your paintings. I'm trying to. You'll just have. Well, I guess maybe maybe with like. I'm trying to just use what I have and make sure that I balancing it enough so that it kind of looks. What do they call it? Like Neural Neural Science? You just think out your images. Like they belong in the in their configuration and their unique configuration that I have here. So I guess you're technically not using paint. You know, fundamental. My point is fundamentals of our earth. Just as important as. Paint that you that you use to create a painting you know you need it, you don't. Alright, I like these. You don't need it, but you need it. We don't. His little dark. The bobblehead characters. You can't see the bottom of her feet, so I'm just going to assume that's where they are. Make this file. Edges. Edges two alot. Tell us about what is in front of what. Is it in your head yet? That is a big deal. Cameron, what were we talking about? It's in my head. You can really kind of when you blend something out. And that's pretty par for the course to a Sam means they have no idea what the chance talking about when we go back and read it. It kind of creates this certain wonder about distance etc. And where something is relative to the viewer. Don't worry about it, dear, if you're fine. When you add. Sharp edge you like. Oh well that is in front that sits in front of. Something else. Owlboy right here. Very clearly. Here's up. Do a couple more here and then will jump over to our actual study. No answer from Roberto. Yes. A larger Ola or you just change them. Because you're getting set up a virtual. It's a heavy anyways. Redness. I am going to create a tonal shift in this whole big piece. Regardless dark green and no no. We got this dark black. I'm going to just. Elias, Maura cheers from Tijuana. Except one Ola como estas and if they have you. Welcome. Alexander, written by Tom out red among. Alexander some in. I think it will call that one the last one. Welcome to the party. Have a seat but they have you. I. Yeah, of course. Make yourself at home. Make yourself at home. You are home. Is your home. Y'all family now. Oh, I like this. This is creating kind of a cityscape. I use a soft interested for a second and I will bring that back. And let me just bring it back a little bit now. I want to do this over much, but I feel like there's a lot to be gained. You know what I'm going to break the undergrad. This What is this? One like and even Taylor Give me something, just air paler. There we go. I did just add a little bit of another color, but I'm standing by the decision. There is some kind of three dimensional thing. I like that. Hey. Baby, I'm going to erase this this path and I might create like has the kind of like in circle this one circle this thing a little bit. Like to something that looks like it's it's. It's coming around and circling binding. Anything again that creates a perception of movement of something. Happening something else? That's what's up. That's why I want. I'm looking for. Trying to grab more. This is soft edge brush. I'm just going to go ahead and just brush in some of these lighter colors. I want to give the feeling of atmosphere and I will get the feeling of lights. And that's kind of what I get from these things when I add them. It's almost like a like a like you're in a park or something. Is funny, I can't even remember what this. What are landscape was originally. Oh no, I know it was. The China I think. Oh It's a modest growth upward. And I'm going to grab this color here and put it in there. No, this color put it in there. And then we grab some of this highlight color and throw it in. I'm not going to throw it in like normal. I'm going to throw it in. And then you some of the surrounding colored brush in and grab that color and that'll be my. True. Highlight color of objects. Call Big part of it. The way I make other parts of it. Very crispy bat. Um increases pharmacies figures. Alright, like this? Whom it is kind of strange characters like who are they? What's going on? What are the surrounding? Very often. Do I just use a normal brush? Accel is ask Alexander. Yes I do. I really do I use. Be hard round brush. From control paints basic 3. I've been meaning to up my brush game for awhile. But I just. Haven't. Taking the time and part of it is because it seems very overwhelming to me. You know he download these brush packs and then you have 70,000 brushes and it's very unclear what you're supposed to use. For what? Yes, this is a nice pressure. What is it is best used for? It's almost like when you go to a diner. And they're like would you like szechuan chicken or pancakes? You know? Would you like the steak or the porridge? I don't. I don't know, man. I kind of wish you only had like 2 choices instead of like 17,000. 'cause that would make my life less stressful. If you go someplace that serves one thing. Noodle place that serves Rahman really well. Then you know when you go there that you ordered from an. And you know it should be good and you feel no stress. You like cool? I will go here. I will order the Rahman. Ramin will be delicious. Yeah, you're very welcome, Alexander. Good luck with your brush, Rahman. Rough down straight lines. Now. No, I'm not going to use too many this hard edge rushers in the background, so just to keep the background and it from looking too crisp. And immediately does a curved. Straight lines only draws a circle, literally just trusts. Should look like the background you know. We put this horizontally. All right, this time to look a little lopsided, I'm going to take this darkness here. I mean expand my my reach. I'm going to create a little bit of shape here. We can have a little bit too hunched already, but let's get it. Some other kind of prong shape. Just get something down. Action. 1st and worry about that. Going to. Proportions in the next phase. I think it had to balance this. Probably a little bit of action down here. Get this kind of. Early. Hum. Something I guess it's not necessarily. Alright, I want to get. Is finding conversation for myself. As you have how to balance things a little bit? I have successfully found. And it makes things look. Hired and put the down payment for a new deck to be built. Like Not to last sighted, you know. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, thank you. Now will be applied. Not that's OK. There we go, including little bit of shading, kind of on the other side or whatever foliage this is. I'm standing up. Down. Yeah. So that should be happening maybe next week. Something like that, I'm not sure. Uh. Will be almost 99. Building of dex so. Total views by thanks for coming and thank you to the 18 people hanging out. Hopefully. It is a pleasure to have you. Everything goes to plan. You guys should probably hear some sawing and hacking and hammering. It is a pleasure to be had. By you. Next week, this time, exciting, isn't it? All right? Bing is is there like almost like a like brambles they like. How long does it take to build up snowman? Still register as paths, but they're kind of Rambly. How long does it take to build? Deck guide you know? Not necessarily go anywhere. But two 5250 I don't know. Like that it creates miss. Couple days. Anyways, I'm happy to just. Bum bum bum bum. You know? Given that. The world's in this kind of Weird Place. I can blend in this color here. Right now I guess that's all I'll say about it. This is still like the whole thing is tilted a little bit like a ship. Wash your hands. So I'm just trying to figure out, like you know, so it's all like this. Yeah, right this orientation. Every I'm man I'm the biggest hypocrite I'm not going to say anything about it wash your hands you're pretty well. But they how do you balance against that exactly? And so I think the answer really is, it's got to be something. Hum. Let me bring out like this color here over here so I'm gonna bring a little bit of that in. I remember I was saying. Background a little bit. Everything. That color as well. I braced with that over here. It will be more. Balancing action. Can see like this guys got. They sound like it is gonna be a spectral muscle. Yes, that's nice. There's no way that says last is that is laughing. But I'm going to create menus this green and I'm going to maybe. You know it's going to be packed, right? Um? There's no way it is lat hanging because he's got. Language like having floating shape, kind of. He's very fit, right? And you can see the lab on that side also. Check is balances, counterbalancing just the right way. True doing pretty well. Maybe this one needs to be less. Or is it is that is what? Chooses baby. It was new deck, right? Listen here. Trying to find somebody to do anything around your house. Here. I guess it was maybe because most people have that way of thinking right now. OK, because. It's just that it's not a good time to hire people, makes it a good time to hire people. Base with that this this this blue around. You know? I'm I'm pretty busy. I will bring some of this blue back. I like how it's fading in here so I'm going to lend that in. You know bond busy then I don't know. What other contractors are experiencing? To do that kind of mix things up in the background, then loop things, see how things mixed together. During all this. Covert miss Coding. Get the home. Yeah. Yeah man, it's great, it's like. Like that it's kind of hugging this mean this mean. Our source of tree, whatever it is. All part of this plan to actually. But I got guys I got. Sell this place at some point in the future and not have any issues with selling it. Gosling's Ginger beer Right now. That sugar boots with my uncle. You know what I mean? Increasing equity where I can, and I think the decks are clearly. That He slipped out. Or if you've seen them, they're awful. Wow. This place was built in the 80s, so it's about time for some things to kind of. I can do the trump drink ready. There we go OK. Now let me let me zoom out for a second. There's a reason we zoom out here is because it. It allows us to kind of see the whole thing from a distance and kind of figure out what's going on. What's not, Elias asks, are you using a reference picture or from your mind? I use this picture. And I color sample from this picture. I grabbed a bunch of colors from this image. And I using it. I'm using those colors to build this fictional. Space. Before I had this picture. Then I use this these colors to build. This. But you're not very careful. Um, this wasn't very cool because the colors are so dramatic. To rain here is too. Do the same exercise. But with this? So the question really becomes. What is my central thesis? What am I doing here? What do I want this to feel like now I think in looking at this and looking at bringing this up, there's something I really like. What's going on and that's just kind of horizontal growing sensation, so I'm going to emphasize that I'm going to start pulling this white. Down to the image. Like this? On a really drag it in. And pull, and I'm trying to create this verticality for the peace. And I think that verticality is kind of was very attractive about this. You know, the idea here is we're trying to use these colors, create a very particular. And the question is what is that feeling now? How does that feeling manifest and what is the essence of that feeling? If you were. That's from a kind of how they wait, I believe. There we go. I'm going to grab these colors. I'm going to drag them down in. In I'm going to have more colors. I'm going to drag those colors down a little bit, and I'm going to start create this feeling. Of growth, so we have almost this kind of network of. Roads or something? I don't know what they are, the kind of lay along the ground. But You have this, then there's something growing up and out. From the space. There we go. I'm going to really start pushing that a little bit. Well, I'm going to do that is going to start lowering. Some of the terrain. You know, kind of Flatting it out. Bring it across like this. I'm going to have other things kind of punching up over it. So specifically. Forms are overlapping on other forms in one particular direction. Not in all directions like before, but in one particular direction. That's how we're going to create this feeling of upward movement of us. Rotate this image again. So it's a little. Uneven, but it's coming together, but more. I think that part of that is that we have to match some of the. The brightness is. That we have going on other areas. And then we have also match their contrast. So again creating this. Elder here creating lower downward movement I can create or. Vacuum here. This unified some of these colors into one shape. That When you start to see these things kind of start coming together, it's very exciting. Very much like wow it there before. There was nothing and now there are things. What's up with all the things? I'm gonna push this little bit back into the background a little bit byte by darkening it up. And I can create all about cradle ball over here. But nothing too sharp because sharp edges catch attention. And this is kind of off to the side, so I don't totally want. So much attention. So much focus. On this shape. And actually, I might even take this. Other color kind of just this, reduce its overall contrast and thus reduce the wrong power. Yeah, let's continue to draw lines down through the environment. Really emphasize. Too many of these shapes. And simplify. That's one thing we forget as artists. Or that it's easy to forget, especially as you continue to belabor particular project. Simplicity is paramount. This really works more than anything. Very effective. I know what these lines are, I don't want that line. I leave them with this line. Yeah, here we go. Yeah. As I said at the beginning of the stream. If you are interested in you want in what you're saying and you want to see more, you want to follow along. Whatever I dropped me follow through on Behance, you happy to have you. Jump on. When I make when I do these compositions, I want to do all kinds of other Art 'cause I've done a lot of different art. You're on the stream, I've done last time I was here. I did a slightly different thing. Which is we did these compositions. And this was more using this cartoon character that like we're doing this large illustration which is super fun to do. And again we did it using kind of starting from a very basic perspective. Where the you know what they are, I know there. There and then also, we've done outright illustrations here on stream, so if you guys were around in Selma Selma early, earlier, streams. Something like put this together. We put this together together. And I never finished it. Actually, I still need to finish it. I'm happy with it, but I still need to finish it. And then we also last time we worked to create. Um? Compositions based on like feelings. So we use little character. Ain't quiet, his character of my creation. And we started using him as a subject for some of these. Feelings, feeling or a word here. This word was void. How do we create a feeling of avoid not just by drawing a thing, but by drawing a composition? This cozy Ride. I think this was like intimidation or something and then we got better and then we started doing even more with it. We got started going Vertigo and we tried two different kinds of Vertigo. And you know these little thumbnail drawings can do an enormous amount. The teachers about the potential of a larger piece of work. On completion. Weathered. And then we made this drawing and we expanded it. Into this chart. This was super fun. They did here at the behest channel with you. So if you were there last week when it made those. Thanks for joining. I had a great time. Had a really good time I learned a lot. I got to make some cool art. We hung out together. It was dope. All right? I honestly my Emma with Adobe. Thing is I know some people like to go on like to immediately know what they're doing. They have a plan how people like to watch those people stream because they want to know a specific thing and that's Awesome, I love to go in here with very little plan. Because it forces me into a very unique headspace, but I get to then invite people into. And then I guess, not necessarily exclusive to sometime. You know it's very helpful to set about learning and try different things. Having having barbecue during the winter is also very, very nice. But oftentimes some of the best learning occurs when we don't really even try. We're experimenting and we're giving ourselves permission. Alright, let's flip it. Which is the worst thing any human can possibly do to. Screw up. If you know me. The drawing is flip it horizontally or merit. And how many of you do if you know me, you know just how important I think it is to have. Then I say, worse, the means the best. That's definitely the best thing that you can do. To be free to screw up, let me try a different camp. Feels like the worst thing. 's house? It's not that bad. Yes, that too close to me. I think it. What it does is it basically just shows you what needs the. It's too close. Go and what needs to be? I guess kind of tweet. How's that? Usually I have to do this kind of thing is just kind of slide everything down. A bad. A little bit at hanging in the background. And everything right here is. There we go. And then I'll just drag my little camera off to the side a little bit. Little bit too large so. Because it's all this a little bit. Yeah, there we go. Bum bum bum Hum. Yeah, I would love to have like I don't have a place that allows me to. Hum, hum. Do you open fire? Doctor Seuss, Doctor Seuss this up just a little bit, right? Pit too that would be. Camping is always been part of my life as he kind of really can't help that when you live in New Brunswick, Canada. What does that mean? Means curves? That means. Wiggles Nothing here should be so rigid. It's literally just like. A couple houses and intense. And perfect that we can't go in here and add some more like. That's that's basically all of New Brunswick. Hum. Fluidity? What else is New Brunswick trails to hike on? Go in there and do that that fluidity. Now for the people who are camping. Let me add some of this. Highlight blue around here. So it makes sense. Want a lot of hiking, a lot of Nature, Parks and stuff like that. Yeah. Lot of trees. As some of that attach it there. Like a zoo statuses. And I really hope that out. I'm going to create, yeah. I know I can't do that here. Unfortunately there's no. I might be just a little bit too dramatic of a difference. I don't know. Maybe a closed contained fires might be. I'm going to go ahead and blew it down just a bit. Find. This so doesn't totally steal attention. As long as they're in aids, the culture and I don't know what you call them like a cage afire cage. From our kind of center, this whatever city were in here. Just don't know this either. I'm gonna grab this darker color or just kind of brush it a little bit more to the exterior of bits just a bit and I like this or I don't see that fits. She spoke with Colten sounds kind of fire coloring. That sounds awesome. Oh yeah, that there. That's just my fire culture here for you, which yeah fire, which? I'm going to add some of this color. Kind of throughout the center here just so I have a little bit more integrated. Which sounds cool too. It sounds pretty awesome as well. It is I see I saw that this was the only color left. Cost would be the place. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right to check out on barbecue. Of its kind in the image and I was like, oh. But I just happen to be absolutely terrified. A save that species before it dies out. Of going to Costco even. It could be useful. When there isn't a pandemic, there's something about Costco and it's. Create variety. Another thing that I find very helpful about things like this and about color referencing from pictures etc. Worse than one person going Walmart it at least it is for me like it's just. Is that it makes you stay away from those primary colors? There's a lot of anxiety going to. Stores, especially now right for myself. Those dramatic, clashing primary colors, but all are the hallmark of. Hum. But I'll definitely be keeping that in mind when the when an opportunity presented service presents itself for me to buy a barbeque man. The uninitiated, when it comes to color. I am. I'm working in colors for years now and I am still pretty uninitiated. And so I find that color control is sometimes beyond Maine. And I, but if I'm restricted. Now there's a really good idea. I even have a membership. By the colors in the photograph. Honestly, sometimes that sets you free. You got it like it's just it's. And if anyone here familiar with the concept of restrictions to the you free. That with prices that Costco has. Insane. But it's it's quite effective. TV's are cheap. Often when we are tasked with more restrictions, we end up being more creative without restrictions, and we were given too much freedom become quite overwhelming. There's so much cheaper at Costco, I think I got my like 55 inch TV. For like under $1000 link is 899 or 866 or some weird number like that. I don't know because I've had that feeling. But that was what I was talking about earlier with regards to the. Will it like it's just literally feel? Uh. The. What's the weather like for? Yeah. Adulting man. Diner The restaurant diner fact. Homeowner kind of stuff. Another thing I need to do, and it's already it's happening like so. I should I should call it that she called the diner effect. There's a guy who is going to be coming by at some point. I should call that effect now is I just called your term. I'm most likely after the Dec 30 made to re balance my house. I know love you guys don't know me or. I live in a think I think in the states. And who I am or. Whatever, but I am a art educator. And I just stumbled on a term that I'm going to incorporate into my art education from here on app. The diner effect two many options. That's real. We have too many options we can. We can fly off and some other random direction. Never know quite how to handle it. The diner effect. Not bad, not bad. That's what it is, is what it says. Not only a. Teacher, I'm also a client. So the only issue we have at the moment with this tree here and that is taking a kind of the middle of the image, is that it doesn't quite. Draw attention in maybe the ways we would expect or want to see from it. It's so far as it, uhm? It's not boasting colors we haven't seen in the rest of the image, and it's not posting shades we haven't seen the image. It's kind of actually being pretty neutral in tone, as everything else. That's fine. Then they have to be dramatically different. But it we do need to know that you know when we're trying to forge. A center point of interest in a piece. Behooves us to use dramatic colors. Untrust So we want to make sure that we. Brasa opportunity when we get it. That would bring this. Gray around. And then we use some of this bright color here to fabricate a little bit of what's going on with these black areas. And just like. Now just kind of created a little bit, a little love in there. There we go. At cool. Like it's getting the sense of like kind of growth. Nothing is growing up around this. That's cool, I like that. Boom Yeah. Both. And everybody here, by the way, is a follower of Aura Watcher or fan of critical role critical role. Finally just shown their next episode finally. This is the Cobit. And I think. FA. Use my art. In like during the break. And they always show off an art. I think I did. Savannah Little God, I think it got shown. I don't know. I haven't watched the episode yet, but I think it got shown and that's exciting. Here we go Wiggles. Number Doctor Seuss. Lego Lego. Understand little bit. Here's a little bit of his white. So it's not quite so bright. Pull over that down a little bit more of a nice. You know contrast. Get that kind of is too much white. Kind of Mary. Is it kind of? Movie I in directions we don't want. Alright, so now I'm using contrast here to make some design decisions. Create a movement form. And just really. How to create enough visual interest that this center becomes suddenly worthy of our attention? That's the goal, right? As we need. Are you going to do piece of art? It's good to know, kind of where the focused's going to be. And to do that? Or as a purposeful action on our part is artists. And this goes for, you know, whether you're a cinematographer, a photographer. An artist. Of any kind. Sculptor. Being able to know and understand where the tensions of the viewer will be. Be able to manipulate that. And then focusing on those areas is. But gives you so much power. As an artist. And these colors very slightly. So that this black for this near black can kind of read through. And it's interesting ways. There we go. Let's rotate this one more time. And then soon we should start another one I think. Is there anybody out there who would? Who has any ideas for what they would like to see in a? You know what kind of color scheme that they would like me to go with? You have an idea. Please do tell. No, it's quiet group. I would come to realize better than Adobe thing. Twit on Twitch people just. Chatterboxes chattering along. People tend to be more observant here. Why is it observant? Big fat Quiet type fares. Bring who? Now here's a question. Oh Wonder if I can bring. Some of these Blues down around the outside. It makes the whole thing feel. Native. Share that's that's even cooler. 'cause that seems less like a like a normal landscape and more like A. Gonna Blenders Thunder stand. And more like a. Like this whole thing is contained or held. It's like a little City Park. It's out of a head of lettuce. What a cool idea. There we go. Got this this late here. And this will go in front of that, maybe around a little bit, but then maybe around that is when we have this kind of circle of white and we can bring some more of that around here. And maybe even if we get rid of so much of the exterior, we get this kind of. Contains feeling that's kind of what I'm going for here at this point. It's funny how you can kind of just create an invent. And just play and end up creating something that is like kind of area unexpectedly fun. Art, am I right? Hey. An art crazy. I said it all. I kind of dig. 2. Bigger. Single. I mean, I don't know. Alright, bring that line down. And then the spring, this brightness around. Mavis brightness around. There we go. Yeah, this is kind of fun, right? I'll zoom out once you can see it this whole thing kind of contained. We started to look like a world. In a little contained little space. That is a turn. All right, and if this whole thing is contained in some kind of world space, well then I want to create. Some some things. The lie that you know some kind of heads of lettuce, other kind of in the foreground here. Uh. Like drawing. The really. I guess what I'm saying is the lighting. There we go. Having having a natural hair is definitely a bonus, and seeing muscle mass is. Now I know where these lines are coming from or why they're coming shooting into this head of lettuce. But I dig. Specifically lean muscle. I think that they are. It comes to like trying to improve your understanding of Anatomy. Nothing about this makes sense, and yet I love it all. It's more beneficial than having. People would maybe a little bit more. Continent. Fat deposits, you know, built up. Heavier people, but with that said, it's still. The great thing about Cafe Brochier Croquis cafeonairvideo.com website is they do have a nice. Yeah. It's more buds. Of action. Of model tapes. Bing. Boom boom boom. And will probably jump to that at some point as well. Oops. OK. On that around. It's fun, it's nice to. Mix up your subject matter. OK. Your models a bit. But in terms of like I say it's not about one specific type of model. OK. I just think that it's really nice for anatomy study. Head studies having having. Bald head in lean muscle Mass. You know? You are going to use literally seen. I like this. I had just a little bit more this black right here 'cause its area of high contrast and this kind of this like Rd. The Anatomy. Moe Betta, I don't know. Going in. I don't think they were. My point is, but. Ooh, I like this is for is creating kind of like this like. Naked dude. Strange. Right now, say that. Growth texture. Thinking model dudes who this is joke were joking now Haha. Wonder if there's some black going through the middle of us? It's safe. Like it through here, if I could blend it in if that would look good, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder. Saved who made made it through that joke? That's a good joke. Uh, with the intense light coming OK everything yes. Yeah, there is definitely during daytime this place lights up really nice. So can we integrate these all these areas in believable ways? In I like these things going through. Yeah. This is cool. First man during the summer. Wait a little more hollow there. Having having the light bill through this place, it's just really nice. Imagine a Asian. Naturally lit. His soul it compared to like the winter sun. The same sun, Derek, but it just. It lights differently. Like us But As with all things with his to do with his exercise, but I think I got to move on because this is. Looking so bleak and grey even with the sun right on a blue Sky day during the middle of the winter. I feel like I could finish this at a later time. Although you know what I should do it once more before I finish this particular one, let me flip this whole thing around. Different. Close the blinds. But Gonna keep flipping, yeah it said this area. Boom Wow, very different feeling right. Very different feeling. And I've seen thing. That Ah, that don't totally work with the whole message I'm getting across, but if I just massage a few things around And I'm just again, I'm not even thinking about. Is that? Don't be stretching lucky standing guys book. Cleaning up my OB. Help me. Standing up and he's going to. A picture of genic reaction at the time change anything about the feeling I want to create. He's going. What's he going to do? No one knows he's going to. I want more of these lines. Missed something gunsmith is sniffing. This goes in front. As we have seen. Snipping, standing. Those behind. Here this white. Standing in snipping notice, standing now. Whoa, whoa, look at that move. Bring some's weight in this world aside all the way across. Look at that lay down wow and then it goes back to sleep. To rate. Just like that man. Back here, it kind of creates this movement like that. When the setting dog. Without kind of getting too much in the way human, I'll let the human mind connected those dots. You're looking into maybe getting a condo. Young man like it's. Here's here's what you really have to think about is like is it going to match and line up to? And I won't worry overmuch about what they're doing. But I know that that feeling of movement is going to persistent and build the space. Your lifestyle like are you living in a city? Are you living in a place that's kind of close to your work? Then? I think justifying that purchase makes a lot of sense. OK. That's working out pretty well, let me. I had a. My buddy yes some department for recently last year. There we go. And I got this color here a little bit of that other on top, so right here. I don't know how everything it was but he said that he also bought a condo. Here. Over in California as well. Hey. And that's just like. At Grace I like that. Rates, but a lot. That creates a very particular. I don't know what French call a certain. I don't know what. A great Cool, that's totally random. And very fun, but I just made. Alright, let's look at these two. I just I'm just done back to back. If similarities in style. This is a more serene. This is more dramatic. Alright, you guys you have any. Requests Or thoughts? I think, or you know environment that you would like to see done next. That all people who are here in the room. It is up to you y'all. Let me know, hit me up tell me what you think and what you would like. See done. Otherwise I will just pick from my great art. Older. And it will be tremendous. But I love to involve other people so. Uh-huh Uh. Alright, no takers. Will see this here. Oh I see. I see I see. Man wow, we got some options guys. That's a cool option right there? Wow, that's dramatic. This is also very cool. What are we going to do? What's it going to be? Um bump bump bump. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. Bum bum bum bum bum. This is very cool wow this is very cool OK. These are these are. These are pretty great, I gotta say. Good references this is pretty fun. I might. I might have to tackle that. That yellow is. Is is nice? Would be cool too though. Oh yeah, I don't know. We got options as we have option. Alright, that's too. Who that so cool? I'm I'm I'm. Wow. As well to abstract. Miss something less abstract? He missed some. Hum. Find something that is it. You know some dramatic highlight colors. Um? This could be kind of cool. I think I'm going to go with this. This is great. Yeah, OK, we're doing. As it were committed, there we go. So I'm gonna go ahead and paste that into this. Test. Wanna hide layer blood going to create a new layer here? I'm going to save. Never forget to save. And then I'm going to. Upper left side. And start painting. So I'm going to go ahead and grab big chunks of this. AM. Hey I've got bam down there and bans black. And bam, this Gray over here. And then I'll grab a little bit of this like kind of pale nests and this blue Ness. And this darkness to start Blue Ness over here and this darkness over here. Then I'll grab this dark turquoise. This other shade of turquoise and in the main body of turquoise, which is nuts. It's a crazy color scheme right there. What is the lowest among light with light? It's about as bright and saturated as it gets right there. OK, right there and then. Otherwise I'm messing with a lot of dark tones here, OK? I can work with that. Let's do that. OK. Oh, this is, you know, this kind of a green here that I would like to salvage if I can. There it is. And it's available for the yellow in. It was like green. That's not it. There it was there it. Well, given that that green. Not bad, anything more for me about the screen. There we go. OK, I got it. I have color shorts the image. Cool, now let's start playing with it. Let's make things up. So I love. I like, I mean, obviously this blue is the power is the power color right? So what we need to do is you need to keep that too. Power must be conserved. How to reduce its amount in general? What's the general default color? This is it down the fall color. OK, so I'm going to go ahead and do a lot of that color across a piece. Maybe has interesting. I was wondering if I could do like exterior of Blue. They have a speed kind of. It's like floating whoops, it's like loading rock thing. In the middle. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. Will experiment. Get the more this green green. Mean. Is kind of the bright greens when the green skip writer that turn into that? Alright, I'm going to try to be a little softer this time. So I'm going to go ahead and start using softer brush strokes. Hum. I'll just. Dislocate a little bit of that blue just so it kind of is deluded a little bit and spread over a certain area. I'm trying to think of what's a good. Like what is what? Some good movement that space? They have seen us in general, swirling. Maybe I want they want that. Except this. To go into deep. Babies kind of mountainous areas. Green and then it's like, no. No highlights ever highlight there. Well. Oh, this would be a cool like top down like a topa graphical jam. Right? We could even remove a lot of this. We can tone down a lot of this turquoise as long as we keep a little bit of it there. We can. We can then we can work magic with it, you know. Yeah, that's nice. Oh, this is kind of oh, that's a nice color nice. Although I gotta, I gotta tell you, it kind of. It's a nice enriching color. It might not be a good color to proliferate everywhere. It doesn't seem to be doing. Will be servicing my. My piece that well. All right? But we'll go wait over here to get rid of that. Or, you know, I'll just. I'll turquoise it up. Over here, what are you doing? Temple, there we go. Boom OK. Alright, I like these streaks look like a face. I don't know if I like that. OK. That cool. Thank you to those who have been calling me during this. I see that in a few followers, harmonica, Jones, Alexander, Radamel. No, no, well yeah I guess so much for following me. It's a pleasure to have you on here. I hope you like what you're seeing. I hope it. Other pleases him. Thanks for thanks for joining. Alright, using this is kind of dislike ring multi ring. Thing I like to create this like gyre of movement here. And maybe what if we had what it maybe would have more of this. Edward And then we kind of had this kind of be this kind of almost like watery shine on the edge of things, then were really capitalizing the idea that this is water. And if this is land that we were looking at. And we're looking at land. How does that tablet topographically workout so? This is kind of exciting actually is if we look at this as a challenge of trying to visualize the 3D landscape. Inventing from our mind, but using these colors they have sampled. We can actually start kind of coming up with like some really cool. Topa graphical like kind of anomaly, not anomaly. Like typographical interest. And we can start generating a 3D space, so I'm going to say that the lighting is coming from the top left down, so we have different settlements in this in the ground and be variations and how things. Shade, etc. But so not everything will be shaded the same way. But in general, if we can get the light. To hit on some of these. Thighs not on the others. And maybe we can create the feeling. But this is a 3D space. This is a 3D environment, so I'm creating these kinds of like legs of land. And also pair with kind of the edge. Edge of. So basically if I go in here and I shade one side in darkness. And I like the other. Using this kind of. Earth stone light. Then we can kind of create some really cool. Semi believable landscapes. Not committed yet, but I like the idea. Also, I'm just down with anything swirling. You know, I mean. Atlas, which is, you know what that's rotate this. I do this fam. Alright, so now the light is coming from. The bottom so different different angle. So let's. To shade on the right side of things. Like this? Why you coming through there we go. There we go. Some kind of activity happening on my blower. That's cool. People getting out. That's nice. Then Hum. Hum. Dumb bum bum bum. I'm done. Hum. Bum bum bum bum bum bum. You can see here I'm using some particular colors to punch outs. Areas of land. It weighs. And hopefully kind of highlight. The three dimensionality ahead. That's the hope anyway. OK. Though as we go higher into these foothills, we might get bit more light hitting them like this. Greenery etc. Green action. And then we'll get some shadows. We might. We think here how is it? How are these? Charlie, go. But I like this movement overall. You know you don't have been really wanting to. Do you guys let me really wanted to work on a map of my fantasy world and really just like? And like. And do all the little like bays and inlets and all that, and I think just doing that would be a great exercise in world building. Um an ingrate exercise in. Kind of like knowing. Like what looks good like what like. Like and like what would be where you know, like when you think about the world through like a kind of a, you know a fictional world for the kind of a geopolitical power struggle. Top down strategy game and started looking at Maps and stuff like that. And you realize, oh, there's also things like tactics and like being tactical. When it comes to geopolitical power, etc. And there's ways that you can do that. As a layman, you can look at a map and be like, oh, I understand if that's there and that's there, then this must be incredibly important. And then you realize, oh, I see. If the country did all it could to hang on to that bit of land, it might be worth their time. Um? And then you can build stories around that. I'm making sense, hope I'm making sense. Just mean I just need to say that you know. At lands. History and politics and all that you know that we've seen in our world, makes for a great study in trying to invent new world, you know. Learn if an enormous amount. Just by studying map. And so I feel like I can invent a lot of things about my world. Right at the cusp, i'ma i'ma fantasy creator for anyone who is curious. By the way I write write fantasy, I have been working in the fantasy realm for my attack. We are. And yeah, so it's kind of my bread and butter. So I can invent things off the hip, you know, just shooting from the hip. Oh, these people have gills on their faces, you know. As terrible example, more messages more magine that generally. But if you can look at, you know if you can look at history or evolution or whatever through a particular lens an explore your world with no preconceptions that direction. Well, then you can kind of create. Beings And nobody's thought of. But suddenly it seems totally believable because. You didn't just make it up. You use their minds to invent. And when when there's an internal consistency in the world that is respected. It goes a really long way in the world of, you know in in world building if you can make somebody believe something about the world. Oh, this is this way oh so of course it makes sense that that would be that way. Well, now you've captured believability you can sell. As a as a fantasy writer or whatever, you can sell a lot of ridiculous things. Premises To an audience, if you can sell that first premise, you know. If I can make you believe that X is true. Then all other wise ease and WS. Kids fall into place. But first you have to believe that access true. That's one of the most complicated parts, I think. Um? But But I. I'm always up for the task. Or they're not incapable of tasks with another issue, but I'm always up for it. Alright, is kind of a bit of a Canyon. Anything going on here? So I'm going to. Just that also this is going to be a little brighter up here. And that's the mountain range that we have. This kind of sudden fall off over here. I'll make that not quite so dark. There we go as some greenery. Wendy's mountain peaks, as some topography love. There. And I can create borders that actually. You know, some watery borders that seemed to. But rest the idea of. This thing is a 3D form. There we go. I would've been. Mr Phineas Hello Sir. We were just talking about world building. Something that I know you're pretty pretty interested in. Then it's it's. It's not like Twitch over here, it's much quieter. So. Just you and me buddy. It's very romantic. It. Now we can still hang out next month. It's like up view of a Lake. Yes, exactly exactly. It looks. It does look like a like that, doesn't it? That's cool, it's coming. It's coming together excellence. Now I'm kind of started to add a little. You know cracks and fissures in the. In the earth, and that's doing a lot, I think to sell. Three dimensionality of it. Let me continue to make that happen across here. I'm going to make this a little bit dimmer over here. Probably this would not be so dark, I feel like. Being lower down, it might be a more illuminated altogether for it. Yeah. Here I will rotate this back. Rotate 180 bam. Cool, so this is actually coming together. It's actually it looks like a top down view. Now let's remind ourselves this came from this image. So kind of it was a top down view. We're doing something very different this time. Here we go. Wonderful. So again, if we have light coming from one side, let's continue to emphasize what side is what. Well, add the shadow in here a bit. I will blend this in here, this is. These two bodies of land are she joined. If you will have some kind of joint over here. Scared is blue in here where it's not. And then we can actually add in. Maybe like a little like Lake in here, like a little. Body of water edge. And then we'll add some shadow on the one side, because it's whatever the land has to kind of collapse down into that. No. Hum. Bum bum bum bum. Very studious feeling in the room there. Bum bum bum bum. Hum. Right, we create a bit more of this world. Yeah, but it could've shoreline glitter. A little bit it actually it makes sense that there would be it just a little bit of color blending I think. Like along some of the edges where, like the kind of edge of Earth goes into. Yeah. See, that's very odd. With all that you got the app and you still aren't able to. Neither just working out the bugs. Thanks for coming. Anyway, good to have you. As always my friend. Let's add some shadows on this side of the mountain. It would not be as much and then maybe on this side the peak goes up. There we go. And I'm learning about how to Draw Something from the Sky. Right now this is cool. I'm not like I didn't know how to do this before and. Now I'm learning. You're just kind of how to you know what works? What doesn't you know, like what wut lines really give certain feelings? What doesn't? I almost never do landscapes 'cause they're very intimidating to me and. I just haven't taken the time to like really figure out. And so this is excellent. Actors for me. Thank you all for being here. Whilst I practice this landscape thing, I'm glad that I hope that it continues to be entertaining. Informative everyone here. Hum. But yeah, I'm having a great time having a grand old time. OK, I'll add some more light on this coast. We definitely trying to create like a certain like. Should I create one last little island right in here? I think so because it creates the swirling feeling there are going for. We can add a little bit of turquoise around the exterior. Keep going into the water. At the Alex believable. Basically what I'm doing is I'm blending. Local land and bring into the water and then bring the watercolor and putting it gently over and then giving it just the Faintest will shoreline. Outline you know? Um? I'm hoping that creates a feeling of like death. Play some mountain continues down under the surface. But we have this very faint. And ripple away. The surface would be. And then that makes me also want to go in here. Just reduce a little bit more that turquoise. Where there's kind of nothing much happening and then use it, but there's a lot happening. I can create general movement in the water. While I'll create this kind of like pushing. Pushing feeling. Now, like ripples. Moving out. And I think that like creating this this feeling. Movement. I think we're creating a certain kind of action. There we go. I will draw more down into the walks into the water with his pen here. Then I'll just again just highlight some of the shore did have to be all of it. It shouldn't be all the way here. But just a little bit of outline there. It help. There we go. And then I'll leave it out. When these values in colors. Little bit more balance. Again, I like this pale. No, like I don't over do it, but it's very nice. Got that. Turquoise. We go. Oh, I'd be able to shoreline lighting. But here. This comes along the shore up the mountains. I like this. Big here. Yeah, we used some of this black on this side. This is black over here. Is that black or is that what is that? Look by black. And will draw some shadows. Oh man, layers in Photoshop Fannar. Blessing at that. I'm using them here to be honest, if you go, but in general. Layers are very helpful. There's a very helpful. There we go. Oops. Area. Me flip it on the X Axis, Bing. All right now I have a good sense of. By the landscape of the lighting is. A lot and I like this muted. Look, we have here of the light of level land. Let's see here. OK so I have a land. Is a water define digital and that the land 'cause like this out? And then if it curves around, is this like? Low of water around the outskirts. Bring it back out here. Bring it back out here. This darkness will be on this side. Move it. Remember it in this in this particular instance we have very dramatic. Kind of lighting sunlight coming from one end. That being said, they happened across some of my favorite villains in later seasons. But this illustration. So. Some of them were stretching where they get a little bit. Too much for themselves, but then at some points they create these really really amazing moment. OK. I'll have some of his lights. Down the coast, I mean down the. So I would highly recommend to watch their definitely lovable characters along the way. Tide up here. And. So worth it just for that. Makes my head dollar. Like not talk hero of the South or North. That Then yeah and then. I can't remember which one. Uh, Anthony says that mine would be airbending goo, so rare. There are some like that. Hear more shadow. Very cool, yes I uh, I think of airbenders outfits is like some of the coolest. There we go. My dream is to make Cos play of all of the different types of bending but once the I design so like you know how they have materials basically that they all use like Firebenders will have different types of outfits but they're all kind of the same material. All right? Area. I like this dark green dominate use that I'll bring in the light green a little bit here. Same with waterbenders. I would just wanted to design those outfits and then make them come true so I could be all the vendors would be so cool. It's a nice foil or out for a nice counterbalance. Uh, and then drying on the little arrow tattoos come on so fun. This turquoise, it's close enough, it's bright enough. I shave my head for that, Ryan says earth would be really cool, but unusable living in Brooklyn, I mean Brooklyn, more like brick linnane you would build bricks. Yeah, like that effect that gives. Come on, think of the possibilities. You could totally be a city vendor, they just haven't gotten to the point where they like modern bending, but in your mind make up a blender story in modern times, see how it works out. All right, there we go. I'll do a little bit of shadow under the surface of the water of the land itself. I'll replicate that. Extrapolate that out. I'm sure it would be super cool. And then I'll just go in again and just highlight a little bit of the edge. France is as cool as fire would be. Also not as usable, so maybe water. I'll cut in there. About what you want, not necessarily what's usable. What would you actually want to do? Yeah, that's nice. Oh my gosh, Brooklyn. And then I'll. Very few more of these cracks, right? What's up, brookwood? I worked so well for me elsewhere. Oh my gosh, alright, we're coming to that two hour mark so I think I will have to call it a night soon. And a lot of them are. None of this cracks end up being kind of like. But as it has one last thing, let's, uh, kind of figure out her pose a little bit more. Boarding too. And then I think all color her in an adds more details to all of these girls. Run off the kind of thing you know as millenia pass and rock. Kind of starts crumbling. All of these little cleanse or Andy's. Here this would be. I'm not sure next time. This would be generally pretty lights. Maybe this would be? I wanted to face up a little bit more than that. It is flatter. Over here a little Mesa. In create some kind of. But I think this actually turned into a pretty good pose to show her off. This is where it climbs up. On the other becomes a meter, will kind of shade them into little bit. Weird one for her forehead though. Ann That's good. Oh, and her ears. I forgot about her ears. Interesting one to figure out. And some cracks without landscape. Very interesting. Sure. Yeah. I think we have to fix over proportion. Source is getting a bit long. That's nice. Hear her legs 2, but that's all good. I wish her well like that. I'm TomTom bum bum bum. Just cut off your feet, problem solved. What happens if I just grab this? Turquoise and push it around. No problem there. Alright, this on there we go, but do you ever just measure with your fingers on your son? I forgot I was going to get create some movement OK alright so I will continue to create a uses dark color and all of her to push and create movement. Take when you're like? OK, that leg versus that leg? There we go, shorten it up a bit. Those are feet, don't you know? All right here we go. Alright, I think were good or no, this yeah will do this expression and then will be good, OK? And there we go and then use the bright color and do the exact same thing. Friends is fire them. Flamio Hotman Grant says love it. Just have them work in tandem, you know. And then in general it will spill out. Anthony says loving it. On this inlet is lit. Oh you guys are too kind. Thank you so much for like hanging out tonight. This is a fun one. Hello. And I got to visit my family today so I will write it off as a good day. Cool cool OK that's cool cool. 'cause I got to hang out with you, my friends and my family. It does create this blowing out feel and we have these individual. My family, so family and friends. That's what life's all about, right? You know? Oh, and I remember tomorrow, James and I are going to be an Adobe live. Movements, and then when they're kind of joined together at the center as we hit the. Hopefully a lot less sweaty will because it's still probably gonna be really hot here. Edge of whatever this piece of land is. They. So um, tomorrow James is hosting me and I am guessing as the drawer. And the flow outward and join forces into this big spill. It's gonna be really fun. So TuneIn and have some fun with us. Of lights of water. Now the shoulder is a little bit too low for her torso. There. There we go. There's a folder. Then bring in the darkness there. There's your shoulder, torso hits boom. Fisher, even deeper darkness we could use. This arm might be doing something else magic evening. Too dark, but it's nice to have that colour variation in there. Hello everybody joining good to see you good to have you. Oh, and then I'm going to have her looking like, huh? We're having fun today. That's my bro. Inventing, creating. Square square head. Put this in a little bit. It's a pleasure to have you all with me. You can't stop myself. All right? I don't want quite that bright at the expense of the image, something that back a little bit. Yeah, and I do like this kind of. I'm gonna have are kind of go off script. Well, as a darker colors. There. There we go. It says I really like how you sort of describe your process while drawing. Less humans are pretty quiet. Or don't talk about the actual process of drawing. Thank you, I yeah listen. That's that's what I definitely set out to do. I think it's important. Not for everybody, but you know. You'll have to narrate while they make art, but I do think it's very helpful. Sometimes too, especially if you. Want people to understand what you're doing? It kind of demystify the process. Um? That's definitely what I'm sitting out here to do. Here is. I don't want what I'm doing to be kind of opaque confusion. I want to be like, Oh, I understand why he did that or he's explained to me why he did that. Because then people are equipped are better equipped. To do this themselves, you know. Let's him from here. That would definitely some light. Here. And here but. Is definitely some action. Yes. There we go. Yeah, so if you guys are watching and you want to. Do more streams like this? You want to kind of explore? You want to have fun? You want to learn about this so much about the fundamentals of art etc. Making me? Follow all? Meet here or follow me on Twitter or Instagram. I left Instagram for a whole month. An Instagram I love 100 followers. And that's just the platform man. It is frustrating. So if you're on Instagram. Give your voice and follow. I'll post this work. On on the gram soon. This is funny. This is I don't usually go this literal with with a piece of Art. I don't try this hard to make it like, oh this is this, but this is that. This is definitely that for sure. Um? I regret nothing I regret. Nothing. And again, again, if any, because if any questions or anything like that, please don't hesitate to let me know. Pleasure to have you specially be had by you. And. Enjoy your company. Thanks man, yeah I'm on. I'm on the twittersphere. Pretty active I would say. It's interesting to have to be on so many platforms. Um? Definitely is. A time sink at this whole social media thing. But I've been doing it for awhile now. If you guys like to social media tweet. You like she like twittering? If you like button? I'm finding. Find the boy. Yeah. I again get that gathers green, which is this greenery. And just like really pitter patter it up. In some it is green. Up in the highlights. Very interesting, OK? Alright, I'm going to move on. Because while I enjoy doing this, I need to keep it fresh. This is the image we started with this image here. Let's make these bigger. Let's make these reference images bigger. I think I should. I should do another one. I think I should do another one. Here's. Is another one I did. Yes. Yeah, just make a little bit bigger than that. And then there's this one. I would like the dots on the shoreline. It seems like the sun setting there. Oh like, what do you mean which starts the blue dots? Or you mean these are these new on the shoreline? You mean the yeah, yeah, do you mean blue? Dumb dumb. Bum bum bum bum bum. Yeah, but I'm bum bum bum. Bah, Bah. Bah Bah Bah Bum Bum. Bump, Bump, Bump, Bump, Bump Bump excellent. Well, thank you Alexander. I'm glad you did that. Blue ones, yeah, the blue dots. Yeah, kind of case that little shimmer. You know that water is shimmer. They always see that right? When you look at the shoreline you always see like. The glitter of water. Touching the light water reflects the light so beautiful you know. When it did, it download it on the Internet. There I'm gonna. This crab, this let's grab a pure blue again from the photo. An really just kind of fly it. Make sure it didn't get diluted in the process. As more this glitter. Like Alexander's talking about. Have fun with it. Make sure it's. You know it's it's getting some play and we can pretend like you know there's in areas where it's especially rocky. We can have some really nice. Like almost trailing. Letter works, you know, 'cause you know that there's a lot of like turbulence in the waters kicking up a little bit, or it's literally glittering around rocks. Litter Splitter glittering. That's what I said. That's it. Yeah, creating nice. And it's hard shine litter. Act Definitely helping our. Light is coming from the side. Bing. There we go. I do like criminal sense of movement as well. It does pleases me. So actually if I create these shapes. And really looking Fillans well. With the different areas, definitely do a lot to like a feeling of movement. It like just this flow of water in a direction and over here in large arrays it might be a little flatter, a bit more calm like this. Right with the waves kind of hit each other and kind of even out into general rocking. Light. But There we go again. Wherever there is drama. We have the water kicking out of it. This is great. I've learned a lot about how to paints, water and landscape etc. Justin doing this one little image. This is great. All right, Alexander Finn. You have a cool picture of landscape that's really cool, like lighting scheme that you guys think I should make into a painting. I've done this one. Which is real trippy. Now I'm looking at it again. Super trippy. This is my first one. Ones like this are kind of the easiest. 'cause they like such a dramatic color scheme. And this is the first one I did actually never got very far with this. This is just a. I'd like to be like applied paint of it though. Um? I didn't end up doing that much with it, but I just dig. Just take the little that I did. I wonder what would happen if I just. I select blurry and the colour range was this. Was the water. All that down there we go. And that way if I just. You saturation, I just you know what levels. I'm going to do that. That's that's cool. It's a nice. Just kind of like pops. Thing is, just a little bit more. What kind of pictures are you looking for? Any specific requirements? No, not at all. None at all. Find a picture off the Internet that you think. Is a cool image and then will not give my computer. A virus and that's it. Let me just expand on this color range thing. I think it looks like I've lost some of the deepest Blues. Select a range. OK, there we go. And now that I've got the brightest of the Brights. I can. Punch it out. Punch it there. We got damn gorgeous. And it would be really cool like make a whole. Now they've done like was one little section. I'm like, yeah I want to like. Do a whole world map one day. Would that be cool? Be quiet, very special, kind of patience. Uh, thing if you could, if you're able to drop it in the able to post links here. Listen, if not, you know I will. Find something cool. There's lots of options. That's cool. That's cool, that's cool. That's very cool actually. That's kind of that's interesting how dramatic. Oh, this is cool. Some great options y'all, though this looks like what we just did that. This is cool. Oh, and that's grand. That's a grand one. And obviously so that that's very similar to what we did before, so I'm gonna leave that for now. I think would be nice I, I wonder? Uh, the one we just did was Iceland, Alexander Blue Jewel. It's called. In Iceland. I don't think. But I'm pumped. Then I don't think. Alright, I'm trying to think this be. I feel little jarque grim. We can do something kind of odd with this one too. We can make we can. We don't have to make it landscape, we can do something like a bigger or something in the neck. Denic Denic Hello. I like that it's close. I don't love it. No blood. See here. That's cause beautiful. And then turn. Downtown. That's also very cool or just wow. What is that? And you know what I'm looking at right now? Is that a giant piece of ice as nuts? Nice. Hello Siri. All right, what am I going to do here? And options your options. I can go with this like Icelandic. It's like, yeah, I mean, I could definitely probably Sky with Greenland's beauty. You like that one? This one here. Is when you went. We can look. We can look. You actually look up. Greenland by this guy Greenland. Cloudy Sky he would if we get anything. Not bad, not bad. Not bad. Not bad, not bad. Well, that's pretty cool. Um, in the best results overall. That's pretty cool. Let's try this one. Let's try this one and let's create something different, alright? So. To static, who's obviously whose name I just messed up. Sorry. My bad. Let's, uh. Start with this. And let's see what we can build and let's build something unusual. This time it won't think about it to deeply right off the bat, but let's just do it all, right? So there's. Dragons is projected pulling these colors in. And we got this dark dark Gray Sky does even with that real. I don't know if it's real or not lighter. Latest and then pale pale white. That's that's pretty much white. That's interesting, alright? Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it good. Good suggestion. And right now I'm just kind of color sampling. I'm kind of just trying to get a nice. Uh, hey Sheridan. Um? Where do you know me from Sheridan? Um? Yeah, I'm on the hands from time to time I've been trying to do it like on basically weekly basis. If I'm able to. And Yeah. Hi Hello Hello. OK great, we have this kind of what's the color of the mountain side dark? Dark. A. All right? Those kind of our our colors. Let's move this off to the side a little bit. There are colors. So now let me flip things around a little bit. I'm gonna grab this color here. And I'm going to apply to the underside here in dive cetera. We're going to make this. What should? What kind of looks like? A like a landscape kind of thing? It's like a more of an undercut. Kind of hanging thing and will add this earth stuff up here. What I think I want to do is I think I want to make some kind of face or something like that. Using these colors, 'cause the unusual mix? And I think it could be really cool if we do something kind of unusual unexpected. But falling for years on Instagram. So I saw your story in just found out today all. Sheraton thank you pleasure. To have you follow me on Instagram. Thank you. And I'm going to be bye. See you do 3D work. Amazing. I will follow you on behalf. Um? Thanks for following. Yeah I I stream sometimes on Twitch as well. I was streamed onto it. She is it. Yesterday, no day before yesterday. Assumed on Twitch. All right? So let's figure out. I'll come up with some kind of. Base or something? So. Now that's going to look yet, but if we have like I see. Raggy I'm gonna start kind of filling in some lines. I don't know if this is going to workout, but. Uh. Dec Czech Republic. Well thank you. Thanks for coming from the Czech Republic. Good to have you. Sheraton, you're amazing. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you very much. Yeah, I enjoy streaming here on on. I have a long history of streaming with Adobe S offer a bunch of years because they stopped, they start streaming. Is basically they were doing. What's it called? They were doing twitch streams for awhile. And then they stopped. That was a couple years ago, but I assume that with him for awhile, which is great brand and we stopped and actually worked on a secret project with them for a couple for like 2 years. On a team there. Um? At a certain basis, real quick right? Jones OK, Smith are pretty common, OK? So this is these are the colors we have. I think we maybe we're using this whites too strongly. Yeah. Let me punch that back. And they are fairly common over here as well. Much that back. Smith, Henry or. Last names that could be first names. I had the mouth open. I'm going to close the mouth. Maybe you know if we if we basically. We have a lot of Irishman. But using the colors and values of this thing. Scottish sentence. Yes, it most was East Coast. But let's see what the scribe this Sky color and then put it underneath. Provinces and states do right. Space kind of thing we have going on so it kind of floats a bit more. I don't know if I like this. I mean I might just mess it up honestly. Hum. Like not, not by mistake, I'm being purposefully. Yeah, OK, so let's go ahead and. I don't know if I like it enough to like face ID enough. Make our. Hum. But we could also start with a face. Flattens layers, So what I like to do, you guys probably, if you've been here before, you probably seen this over here. And then make it into something else. So maybe that would be a fun exercise. Um? I just leave my muscle on. It says edit quick mask mode. This is unlike most of these tools on this bar, whereas it's a button like an on off switch, right? Thanks Phil. I'll maybe I'll use that one next time I next time I do a painting. I can't access it now. With ease. So if we click it, it's now set to a different mode, right? But that's a great that might be a great place to start next time. It's set to wear now editing in standard mode. Sorry, I thought you could post right here on the stream, but I was wrong. That's not correct at all. Apparently. OK, so it says it says what you want to do after you've already clicked it as the highlight or the tooltip rather sorry. She gets make sense. They don't want people spamming people. You know that kind of thing. Could this be anymore confusing so I'm now in non standard mode. Yeah, I was on twist the other day working on a 3D model. Sheraton I thought you'd be interested. Interested to hear it's a model of a face. Don't know what it's called right now, but that's fine. I'll be by sign off from here. Don't really need to know where when it comes to painting. I'll be going onto that. And and basically. So basically everything will be pink. You know what? It's a It's a model. What if I wanted? The faces Porsche with all the muscles and all that. What if I wanted? So people here are watching and they want to see that come find me on Twitch and you will see some really fun. Turquoise, Nope, you're getting pink. Very dull pink. But what if I wanted? Bony, Bony protrusions muscular protuberances. Blue voice, no, it's still going to be paint. Other strange words like that. You can kind of see what's happening here. Um, I'm learning a lot about human anatomy. So basically everything that's going to be pink is going to be. Which is saying alot 'cause actually no fair amount just because I'm a character doesn't have been cared artist for so many years. Not your selection. But when it comes to the specific muscles of the face etc I've. I so imagine word literally. Don't know as much as I thought I did, or I maybe I knew. Stenciling were literally we drew this and now we're cutting out. I know that I never knew but. Um? Of our large, I don't know Bristol board or whatever you want to call it. We're cutting our stencil out. But it's fascinating regardless. With the pink watermelon. Excellent thanks share. Jolly rancher Best flavor fight me. Sheridan Yeah today were I'll show you were doing since some people just walked in here. You know what I won't fight you if your choice is. Sour Apple is that what it's called Sour Apple? 'cause that is a valid choice. We're using photo references to use like this photo reference. But watermelon, certainly. Great, this piece of Art. You know this better? And. This photo reference. Or is it doesn't matter, just wanna know. Create this piece of Arts. You'll get pink in. You will love absolute. That's basically what I'm in so few words. This is a photo evidence. Yes, that's what I'm trying to say. To create this piece art. And most recently we used. I honestly don't know if there's a way to change this color, is there? This photo Create this. That you're painting your selection. And so we're going to do this one more again, I don't know what it's going to be. Pink color becomes something. I think. I think there is actually think I remember doing it and then being like this is awful and then change it back. I mean, it looks a lot like a face at the moment. I think that's what happened. 'cause it just felt so like taboo and wrong. But I don't know that I want to do that because I often I feel like that that's kind of goes against my. Ted to be painting with non watermelon pink. Um? You can even you even smell it. Can we go get a little bit against my like? Everybody right now. Just scratch your monitor like get a get like a rusted piece of Mail or or like. Aim today, which was. Oh, thanks Sheridan. Think it chipped. Do you know the Czech Republic? Yes, of course. Bedrock or something and just start scratching your monitor and then smell it. Of course, I never. I've never been there. And I know it and I know. You could even you can almost smell the watermelon is. I have a few friends who were from the Czech Republic. That's how pink it is, by the way, do not do not scratch your monitor that was that was a little bit. I really want to go one day. Yeah, So what I'm saying is I want to make this face, but I don't want to make something that will. That's a joke. Adobe or myself will not be responsible for any scratch monitors in this broadcast. If I get it wrong will look wrong. You could say that faster. I don't want that, but in fact I'm actually kind of right now. I'm kind of doing things. I'm going to make a bunch of marks that are not that don't necessarily make sense with the design of a face, because I don't want to totally be dragging that direction. In by your silence, we take it as your agreement. Is that possible? Could I could actually do legal stuff like that? And yet I did myself. I don't know. Part of me feels like I could feel myself doing it doing that, like letting myself be drawn in that direction. All right? So like I was saying, we're literally just. Um? So it's so much of this project today, is it about improvising? So maybe I've. I've gone too far with it, but you know what I can. I can kind of like just invent and we can kind of just. We can build something unique. It doesn't. You know it already looks like something that's like not quite. Um? Its every night human or composed of human like elements, flesh and blood etc. Maybe we could just capitalize on that to make it extra weird and really take advantage of that. Let's see here. What are the input areas of interest? Victory Christian tributaries that down the length of the face. Is he just lines? It disrupts things that like to connect things. They can kind of create some of those. Then I can kind of indicates me some more mayhem to work with. Yeah. There we go. Oops. So it might be a little bit strong, but actually there's an element of the white that works for me because it actually creates this kind of. Impactful splatter of action. That's interesting, I can. I can I can take some of that that line and turn it into a kind of a specular highlight. Some of that can be something else, some other effects. We go. Alright, we create some more cracks etc. That's those are the wrong kinds that found on color. I want something darker. Yeah. All right? Let's rotate this image. Interesting. Interesting. Extend these eyes out and then actually I can create a crack. I create one of these cracks. It down the middle. That'll really throw some chaos in there. And then we can add some shadows or imply that shadows if you will. As far side. Asthma brightness. There. OK. And I create, you know, I could even one more crack. And the side. Cool. All right, and then I'm going to create some. Let me continue to work on my mass is building out so many colors and then I want to add some texture, something maybe some bubbliness, some mossy. Kind of texture to kind of counteract and a craggy element of it, and maybe make him look like he's really. The Hues of rock man, you know. Some kind. And create, yeah. I like some of this weight, maybe balancing out against the bottom here. Mostly it's a yellowish white, sure. Every up. Hey, can you see the face? Does it make sense? I'm looking forward to the fallout show. Yeah, the show movie, whatever it is, I'm into it. I'm like you know, do I think it would be good? I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no idea, but I gotta tell you the source material there. I have no idea, but I gotta tell you the source material there. Working from is pretty great. Working from is pretty great. Excited and pumped. Excited and pumped. I hope they like you some of my mantra designs, you know. I hope they like you some of my mantra designs, you know. That would be dope. That would be dope. That would be really cool. That would be really cool. I mean it would. I mean it would. It would also not be cool 'cause you know not getting paid anything. It would also not be cool 'cause you know not getting paid anything. But even if I work there, I wouldn't be getting paid anything that you know 'cause it belongs to them, right? But even if I work there, I wouldn't be getting paid anything that you know 'cause it belongs to them, right? Yeah, I'm excited. Yeah, I'm excited. But a cool idea. But a cool idea. For show I've been wanting. For show I've been wanting. Fallout show. Fallout show. Or fallout movie rather. Or fallout movie rather. Like forever. Like forever. Universe is just begging for it, you know? Universe is just begging for it, you know? Like that not our universe, I mean like the fallout universe. Like that not our universe, I mean like the fallout universe. Is begging for some kind of? Is begging for some kind of? You know that the world has so much potential, I feel. You know that the world has so much potential, I feel. OK. OK. I've had this made by the simple for me Westworld. I've had this made by the simple for me Westworld. That's true that I might actually be really good. That's true that I might actually be really good. Yeah, maybe I have mixed feelings about Westworld, but I do feel that they know fun. Yeah, maybe I have mixed feelings about Westworld, but I do feel that they know fun. And so I think that's the key here, you know. And so I think that's the key here, you know. Is will it be fun? Is will it be fun? And that's cool. And that's cool. That's imaginative and. That's imaginative and. It's also funny because. It's also funny because. Westworld is so much about like kind of games. Westworld is so much about like kind of games. In the world of Westworld, like the world that like existed that everyone used to go in and. In the world of Westworld, like the world that like existed that everyone used to go in and. Play Cowboys and Indians. Play Cowboys and Indians. It. It. It's like it's like A. It's like it's like A. It's like an open world game, basically right. It's like an open world game, basically right. Kind of what it is. Kind of what it is. Thank you Alexander graduate despite details. Thank you Alexander graduate despite details. They do kind of add a little something something. They do kind of add a little something something. I'm glad you think so. I'm glad you think so. You know, part of me is quite jealous that they're making this show, and I'm not involved. You know, part of me is quite jealous that they're making this show, and I'm not involved. But on their hand, there was never any. But on their hand, there was never any. There was never really going to be any circumstance where I would be involved if I were to Bethesda, I still wouldn't be involved because they did not. There was never really going to be any circumstance where I would be involved if I were to Bethesda, I still wouldn't be involved because they did not. It's not really how they worked, you know? It's not really how they worked, you know? There are quite a corporate structure to be honest with you. There are quite a corporate structure to be honest with you. Um? Um? I'll give it an assignment under eyelid. I'll give it an assignment under eyelid. Um? Um? And so yeah, they wouldn't. And so yeah, they wouldn't. I wouldn't really be a part of this project anyway. I wouldn't really be a part of this project anyway. But I'll just be psyched if they like you know if we see death claw on the show or something and it looks like just like my desk while you know. But I'll just be psyched if they like you know if we see death claw on the show or something and it looks like just like my desk while you know. Um? Um? There we go. There we go. All right? All right? Cool cool cool cool I like this this this kind of turned out and have fun. Cool cool cool cool I like this this this kind of turned out and have fun. Now I'm going to. Now I'm going to. Now I'm going to create some kind of texture. Now I'm going to create some kind of texture. To the faithful little bit you know will continue to refine. To the faithful little bit you know will continue to refine. The face itself. The face itself. But I definitely want to create some feeling of like. But I definitely want to create some feeling of like. Like growth or something. Like growth or something. So Adam start adding in these kinds of. So Adam start adding in these kinds of. Let me start trying to raise some. Let me start trying to raise some. Elvis. Elvis. Like what would it look like if if this was kind of like looked like greenery or something you know like Moss? Like what would it look like if if this was kind of like looked like greenery or something you know like Moss? I don't think you can create a fallout universe in. I don't think you can create a fallout universe in. China. China. Because it kind of flies in the face of. Because it kind of flies in the face of.

I love the lighting the bright light on the left and the shadows and the rushing water. I think it's going to be a little bit of a challenge as a lot of things that I need practice in like rocks and the water texture. I think is gonna be interesting try show the motion. But my my intention here. It's Fazio my gosh. I feel like I don't even know if I ever knew that. Your name was Madeline I feel like I would have remembered that anyway spoilers. I hope you don't mind you can always go and edit your name if you wanted to make it a different name. So if if privacy is a thing you can change that. But thanks for coming by high Missouri great to see you, you guys can grab the reference. If you're interested in painting along but yeah, I'm going to put this on my other monitor and actually let me also. Put a little thumbnail view of what I'm going to be painting on the screen. So we can see that while we are painting. It's not much, but it still helps a little bit, I think. OK. Yay. Without the extra EI know my name has a lot of ease in it. He had no worries, no worries. Oh, I didn't even see the mantis one yet. I'm gonna lookout for that later Missouri. OK, well, let's begin so my when I do studies. I like to try to budget my time. An you know pick a certain amount of time that I want the study to be completed in. It just kind of helps me pay attention more to what I'm doing and. But I have to make more deliberate decisions in in my art so my goal is to finish this in. 2 to 3 hours. I'm thinking probably 3, so I want to do something I want to do get a nice result at the end of this so I'm just going to keep an eye on the time throughout the stream and you know, kind of budget that the level of detail depending on that, so, so let's start with the sketch. So I'm going to begin the usual way, which is establishing the horizon line. This one, it seems like we're going to kind of do 1/3 Sky at the Top and then 2/3, is going to be water and mud and everything like that. Is the tool things enabled yes? I did I do have the tool timeline and it is capturing but it's possible that I I think it might be only might be only viewable in the replay. Uh. I think I think that's how it works. I'm still learning everything. Here, too, is my second stream on be hands and I'm excited to be here. But I'm I'm learning how everything works. I'm not exactly sure. I think from what happened with the first dream. I think that the tool capture will be available during the video replay. Um. So you can check that later but that's going to be really cool. Then there's some new things in the tool timeline so the new version is like capturing more information, so I'm curious to see. Hey shadow craft thanks for coming by. Nice to meet you and you knew shadowcraft person, it doesn't work that way does it. Anyway, OK, OK so. Here we go. New layer I'm going to start with the big shapes. So when doing these kind of studies. There is a lot going on in the scene. So it helps to kind of break it down into starting big to small and just focusing on like the biggest and most important shapes you see in the scene and if anything. If you want to stylize you can kind of exaggerate them. But the key is we want to get into any details yet. We wanna stay with B. Want to keep this on like a big picture level right now. Robert Hey, dust, good to see you thanks for coming. Ha ha. How Is Everybody? OK, so one thing that I really like in this scene is the overlap where you see the bright light hitting left side in the back and then we get kind of a silhouette where like the darker rocks are coming down at the front and then we get extra bit of light where the Sky is reflecting off of the wet like the mud in the water. That's pouring through here and it's it's really cool. There's a lot of different textures, an movement in this. I like it, I think it's a challenging one. The perspective is a little odd were like down low on the ground, but that's kind of cool something different. No. Well, I'm glad you're doing better phasing. Yeah, so I'm focusing this is almost like the landscape well. I guess it is the landscape version of a gesture drawing like in figure, drawing where you would focus on the. The gesture of the pose and not worry too much about like the specific anatomy. That's kind of what I'm doing right now. Just sketching and trying to stay loose and trying to just focus on like the movement. The overall a big shapes and the movement of this. Particular scene, the personality of it. Things will probably change I don't like to get super super detailed like I don't go past sketching into any kind of real line work because usually when I get into the painting Phase I like things to be flexible. I like to figure a lot of stuff out in the painting Phase I just use. This sketch to get me started so it's not completely off the wall. If I try to go in with shapes in the beginning and I haven't sketched anything that can be really difficult to do. It's kind of fun, sometimes, but if you want good results. It can be really tough to be specific. Um. I know I did miss you guys. Well, I wanted to do I wanted to do a stream here this week and yeah. It's just crazy. He's just been been crazy, and today seems like a good opportunity since. Yeah, I had the evening available. I wasn't sure because you guys know is a recently 6. I wasn't sure how my stamina was going to be for streaming tonight. But I'm actually feeling good, I got some tea. So excuse me. Yeah, so I'm good. All that's nice. That's nice best well thanks for popping in to say Hey. Spoiler alert I memati I've been told gestures and everything, not only figures. Starting your learning with gesturing figures an easier introduction. That's so cool, yeah, I'm kind of sort of discovering that myself, too, it seems. Like you can put gesture into everything. Even even rocks, they have like a movement to them. Alright, I'm this is almost done as far as like the sketch for me. Although I do use transform tools and my sketching phase, oftentimes will notice like the proportions and my original go at the sketch or not right like for example, these rocks should be a lot closer to us so to really sell the idea that. On the left side of the canvas it's getting closer. These are getting closer to us I need to. Into layer them like this. All right? Yeah. That's better. So that's why I like to try to do my Horizon Line on a separate layer because all this stuff. Isn't disturbing it while I'm messing with everything here? So I'm just going to race out. The horizon line wherever it's not needed anymore. And. Think will be good to go. You know, I didn't think of this, but I probably should have put a Gray background. So you guys don't have to. See this bright white kind of harsh to sketch on. Here we go. Do you pay much attention to the horizon when you're painting or just get it for the initial sketch just for the initial sketch because it helps me place it helps me get a? Feeling of the perspective. Not that I I'm not usually one to like pull out perspective grids and start getting too. Precise with it, but it just gives me a starting .2. Base everything off of. Let's zoom in a little bit. Yeah, that's that's better. Alright so I want to because I. Extended the line work outside of the edge of the cannabis. I want to get rid of the extra so I'm going to click the crop tool, it's going to. But the cropping box around my whole canvas. And I can just check off delete cropped pixels and press enter and it's going to drop off all that extra stuff, so I can just have a nice clean. Canvas. Never liked perspective grids, too much eyeballing in roof perspective is a lot easier to handle yeah. I think you know for certain types of illustration when you really have to be precise than you might have to go in that direction. But for the type of painting that I do. It's I don't get into as much technical stuff with buildings and things so I can usually eyeball it. Are you doing? An underpainting that's an interesting idea? It's nice to do an underpainting. With scenes like this because. I just think that the color palette work would work well well for it. But. There's also some nice clean things about this Sky. I'm just going to. I'm just going to go with my instincts on this and see where that leads I did to be honest. I didn't have too much of a plan. Yet exactly what workflow I was going to use. Usually I I think most artists have, like a couple different workflows and it kind of depends on the scene, where they're going to wear direction. They're going to go in. Sounds good fizi enjoy your food. So I think I'm going to start with the Sky. I usually start with going back to front and big to small with shapes so for me. Oh yeah, I'm going to take the layer with the sketch and just put that on a lower opacity. And put the layer under multiply so it's a little easier to see through and just lock. The layer up here and then I'm going to paint on a layer below that so. One thing I could do is instead of having a grape background as a as an underpainting sort of idea. I could just throw a color back there, it doesn't necessarily have to be. Hand painted it's nice sometimes if you want to use like a textured brush to do the under paintings that will give a little more of a traditional vibe, but we could use something like that just to get rid of the. Blank canvas and put a color there rather than rather than blue. I mean, Gray and now we're going to go into the blue Sky. So usually I just well. They usually almost always I. I like to just look at the reference and try to. Select colors based on just kind of eyeballing it. So I'm not always 100% on with the colours. I pick but. Doing that is good practice. Being able to. See the colors and. Identify them kind of recreate them and it makes painting little faster thing. When you get more comfortable with that. So basically that's just the start of the Sky, I can even merge it down. And then I'm going to keep this for me, there's like 2 Main. Things I want to keep separate in this scene. One is the Sky and one is basically everything else. The rocks come up in front of the Sky. So I think it's might be pretty handy to keep this guy on it separate layer. So I can work on clouds and stuff back there without getting interrupted by. The overlapping Canyon. So I'm just holding shift to continue, adding to the selection 'cause not easy to make a perfect selection in one go. Blocking in with Airbrush. Um that's what I did for the Sky that was just the Airbrush back there. For the rest of it. Yeah, I probably will begin with the airbrush usually I'll block in with either an airbrush or like a solid rectangular painting brush and it depends on how much texture. I want in that thing or it depends on a number of things, which one I'm going to go with. But for this, I think. There's enough of a reason I I think I would choose an airbrush for this is if you look at the reference. Even though there's rocks. And a lot of different details and shadow that we can add in later. There's really like a pretty smooth gradient. If you just look at the scene like at least everything in the shadows. There's there's a pretty smooth gradient. I think it would be nice to start off with the airbrush so let me just drop in a color too. Create the shape here and then I'll explain more. So. Now that I have this shape. I can go to the lock transparency button up here and just check that down the checkerboard. Button appear if I break that down. Then the transparency is locked on the layer so anything that I do. It's only going to affect that shape and it doesn't affect the background also makes it really easy to come up. Here and just kind of with the airbrush on a really large size. It just start giving a big gradient and putting all this and shadow up here and just kind of looking at the reference. Just kind of matching what I see maybe there's a little bit more warm color here, so I'll just go to my. Color wheel go a little bit more warm little bit more towards red, orange, going towards Orange. And look at how much it starts kind of matching with the scene with no level of detail whatsoever. That's why I really like using gradients to begin blocking things in 'cause, you can start getting a feeling for the scene really quick and then go on Top and start giving your details and. If you're doing, especially for doing a speed paint or something like that one of these virtual Plein Air Studies. It's a quick way to get your painting started and get to a certain point quickly so. We have some highlights here now, what I'm not going to do is paint in in this stage like the really, really bright lights. If you look at the reference. There's like a layer of reflection on Top of the water. So I'm almost like pretending I don't see that and just painting as if it's the colour that exists. Like Ah if you're seeing through the water rather than the reflection. I'll paint that separately. So that we can get the hard edges and the texture of it. So. OK. What next I think the next biggest shape or most important thing is the lighting on the left? So. Because there's such a hard edged dramatic edge here just going to make a selection. Around the area of The Shadow and just selecting the only the area that I want my brush to be able to effect and I'm just going to make a big selection of that, so I still have the lock transparency and now I've also selected an even smaller area. So now my brushes only going to affect this spot so. You say you're going to stream for 3 hours when you're going to eat. I actually ate some sushi right before the stream so I'm very happy. Don't worry don't worry. I'm now. I can't go without eating very, very long so I definitely had to take care of that, but thank you for thinking about me. So the brightest lights coming in here. Something like that. And there, we go it doesn't look great. But it's just the blocking end just phase number one we can add a little bit more warm light, maybe there, we go. All right. So. At some point we can actually take away the sketch, but not yet not yet not even close. Where to block in a lot more things and then we have to do that. Now I want sushi, I know doesn't thing when you it's like coffee and Sushi. If you even say the word. It's like now, I need that every time. OK. So next thing. I think I'm going to focus on the rocks before we get into any foliage. I can get the rock structure down and be happy foliage is kind of A. That's going to be like the icing on Top of the cake in this one. And get all the rocks done 1st. So Speaking of that I think let's get into our first layer of shading. So I'm going to make a new layer right click that layer and go to create clipping mask so this kind of has the same effect of the lock transparency, so now I can paint here. Anywhere I want over this whole shape, but it's on a separate layer. So it's not just restricting to within that shape but also I can move it around. I can change it. I can get rid of the layer entirely so it's a little bit less destructive an I can. Yeah, it just let's me. Be a little bit more careful. So. Yeah, I have heard that before I have heard that that's a saying in French. We're walking stomachs. I've heard. I think I've heard my mom accused accuse me of that. OK, so. Yeah, OK? What am I doing we're painting. Let's get the OK. Let me show you want. My favorite brushes is this basic flat brush. Like we talked about to sushi for 2 seconds and I'm like already. What am I doing? So we're going to make a selection. Basically, the area. I'm working on right now is on the right side Top right side of this rock up here. The Canyon has really cool effect of drips like water. Yeah, I don't know what it actually is I don't know if it's some kind of mold or just the rock is colored from water going down. But it's cool look so I'm going to select. The whole area where that effect is taking place. And. It goes behind some other stuff at some point so. We won't worry about it, too much there, but Creating like a little Stencil area that's like a stencil for myself. So now. I can find the color. I want to use for that. Area of the Rock and maybe I'll use a little bit more of a of a textured brush. Maybe something like this would be better. Yeah, I was just kind of lightly bring this sort of striping look down. Down the rock. And then I can deselect. And there, you go it was a nice way to like stay in the lines. It looks like there's some. I can just sort of freehand paint here. This is where we're going to have. Some fully age and things to when we get to that point, so right now. I'm just going to sketch things in a little bit. This is like the rock like the base that we're going to end up Pudding. Plants on so a lot of this is going to be covered. Phasing where did you hear that one from 'cause my mom used to say that to my mom has all the old sayings like she knows all those like idioms and things where you it's kind of like a colloquialism. I guess you could also say she knows all of those she's always saying funny stuff. But thanks to her. I know what a lot of those things mean which is also kind of handy. OK, so I'm trying to think what's the next thing going to be there's a there's a little bit more of this effect coming down here. Mrs I heard of hollow leg for drinkers OK. Well, I don't think that pertains to a phasis child funny. Alright so. OK up here we're just going to dust some more purple Gray. Uh there's so many pretty colors in this scene. I like how the Canyon has these layers and layers. Also I'm kind of working with the exception of the left side 'cause that was just a large area that I thought made sense to block in the light with the exception of that I'm mostly working dark to light so. I have to be a little bit patient. 'cause I am I'm looking forward to putting in highlights at the Top of that area. I was just working on. I think it's really going to make it pop and show the layers a little bit better. The layers of rock like going up and up to the Top but. Um. Gotta go. In order you don't have to go in the same order as me, but you know if you had workflow and it's good to kind of. Stick with it unless you're particularly experimenting but I found that going. Dark to light is in most situations is going to be more efficient. 'cause you can kind of get away with illustrating less things. And things that faded into shadow your brain just kind of accepts them and you don't really have to illustrate so much in those areas and then the highlights really pop out. So I like doing dark to light the only downside is really while you're working. You kind of have to be patient during some early stages, where you're just waiting for to add those that pop in the highlights so. It's going to be fun, we can put them in. So there's a large rock here with an interesting shape and some cool markings on the side. But I think I'm just going to sketch in the. The location of the Iraq and I think I'm going to do that all around the rocks just kind of establish them a little bit better. And then we'll get into the shading and texture in detailing. I've seen it a couple of type of scenes in this location. I'd really like to see this in person. Someday, this is Fry Canyon in Utah and I've seen so many beautiful pictures from Utah. I've never been there. And one of the things I like most of the scene is that the water and the. And the rocks are. Reflecting light from the Sky and they have this like very delicate light purple light blue reflection off of just the just the sides. The rock that are facing towards the Sky. Right so rocks over here, a little closer to us. I also want to. Figure out where they are. Get some of the where some of the cracks are going to be in some of the edges. I like to use the smudge brush. I haven't really gotten to a place where we need to use it. A lot yet. But as I get into the rendering. I'll probably use it a bit. I really like the smudge brush, especially in combination with the lasso tool airbrush. To smooth out some of those hard edges. So I may not be reproducing every location of every rock correctly to the reference but that's not super important to me. I just want to get. The feeling of the scene. Oh, OK that's murder. That's why I was like what am I doing? OK. There we go. So if we want to make this rock a little bit higher. The only thing I don't want that I'm starting to get here is. You want to avoid especially if you're painting natural scenes, especially but I think in general. You want to avoid having like the same size shape. Repeated over and over again, you kind of want to have a little bit of an all altering thier sizes of your shapes that will make it more interesting just better design, so these rocks right now, it's kind of like boom boom boom copy paste like they're looking very. Matchy Matchy Matchy, I'm going to merge these layers together so. There we go now I can work freely here. But I'm going to move some things so I can change the size the sizes of the rocks. So make that one a little bit bigger. Is closest to us? And merge it down this one over here. Oh, I forgot I need to make that on you layer. The most distant one, I'm going to make it smaller. And then we'll figure out the middle the rock in the middle. They still look the same. Why? Who? OK, I think I'm seeing the problem, so in the reference. This rock in the back has more the feeling that it's on a higher level. Like there's actually more. Land that comes in between them more of the. The rock. And then it comes down, and there's there's just a feeling of more distance between the second third. Second third rocks. So let's try that. Troubleshooting. Yeah, we have, like the the water that's reflecting the Sky. That's coming down through here. Something like that little zigzag. Thanks, Basey. Ciroc Sarah puzzle so you have the sketch layer background color layer layer. We started adding in the darks. Yes, that's correct so the layers. I have right now are this funny background just gradient of the Sky these rocks. And then the sketch on Top an what I'm working on I emerged. The layer with the shadows so that I could more easily. Make changes to that. I know it might be counter intuitive but I like to merge stuff. 'cause then when it when I'm doing this kind of study. I don't like to keep so many separate layers. I feel like at some point, it makes me slower. As well, he says for me, it's sketch layer background layer dark layer light layer and then details wow. That's awesome. That seems so organized. OK, so. Let's start. Shading in some of these rocks. Then merged panic panic. Phase of your just all over the place. I used to have a million layers just a million layers. When I would when I would paint I was so scared of? Getting rid of a layer and then regretting it later. So it's Vinik transformation for me to go from that to having a pretty minimal amount. Still work on the workflow thing that's totally normal. That's very, very. All right there, we go so I'm using the lasso tool to block off an area. The Top of this rock that's facing up towards the Sky. And that's going to have some blue reflection. And then I'm going to do the same thing for this rock just going to select the rock just the area that's getting lit by bound flight. The left hand side of the rocks are getting reflection from this wall so they're getting like an orange glow and then the right is getting lit by the Sky, so that's so pretty so pretty. Alright so I want to bring the edge of this rock back in so we have a nice clean silhouette. I'm there. And it's starting to get better, so I'm going to get a little better. I love again this is a lasso tool an airbrush doing almost all the work right now because it's amazing detail really comes second to just getting the right values and colors in place even if everything is smooth. That's kind of the most important thing for the painting to read well and then we can get into the fancy stuff. Yeah, separately issued based shading lighting. Yeah, I used to do the same thing do you group your layers? At least that they can help a little bit organized things when you have a ton. Alright so I'm going to flip my campus. And I'm actually going to put my reference to on the other monitor. I have a larger version of my reference on my left monitor here so I can. Go look at that. You use the clipping masks Oh OK cool so you just have a bunch of 'em clip down there? Yeah. I swear we went the same path fasy you're going to be fine. I did the same exact thing. It just takes a little bit too. Get comfortable with. 'Cause and some artists always have a lot of layers. There's nothing there's nothing wrong with that. But I think you will get more confident with merging somethings earlier you know as you go your painting. See. Well, if you guys are working on any artworks or anything. I hope it's all going well. This down. To show a little bit more of that rock back there. Flipping the canvas gave me a little bit more of a fresh. View so. Look again. Try something with the rocks. Different line layers. Great. Yeah, if I had to only use three brushes, I probably. Do hard round brush soft air brush and smudge smudge brush. Oh, cool, Feizi we're going to look at some of those. Tomorrow. If you want to do share a work in progress or not there's no pressure. Alright guys so. I'm right now, emerging so that I have this background, the rocks and everything and then the sketch. An I think what I'm actually going to do is just select the area that I need from the sketch. The only thing that I really need from there now is the little bit where the water is because everything else is. Already been painted in enough that I don't really need to sketch anymore so. I'm going to take this and merge it down. So yeah, we can really probably just erase the sketch now, so we're down to 2 layers. And time Wise I think we're doing pretty good. We have a couple hours left so I think this is good base. I'm going to go back to that rectangle texture brush. I'm going to make a new layer above what I'm doing and just hand paint a little bit. We did a bit of airbrushing. And now I'm going to come in and do some painting with A paintbrush. I like to mix them together, 'cause I feel like the airbrushes convenient and. Quick but I like the look of of the hand to hand painted look of actually using using brushes and getting texture and stuff, so. Can I go back and forth? Started this one over the first attempt was a disaster. Yeah, I know how that is, I know. Sometimes it's a really smart idea to start fresh on something it's just not working and you're feeling bad when you work on it, you're just not not into it. Comparisons best 3rd over. I like that blue purple color that I kind of chose by accident. I'm going to add a little bit of that to the Top of this. 'Cause there's some were talking about the light from the Sky, bouncing off there's a little bit of like a light purple kind of affect up here. Right I'm going to select there's some rocks in the centre here and I didn't really sketch them out there kind of smaller, so I'm just going to select with the airbrush. The shapes of the rocks that I want to use and hopefully my airbrush selection is going to be nice enough we'll see. Little shadow on the side. Making a little smaller. Right I think that's fine. Grab the airbrush an add a little shadow, so the lights coming from behind these rocks. So they're going to have. Shadow on the ground right underneath them. Right so selecting an area and going to bring that shadow from the underneath the behind the rocks. There's also some darker rocks. And a little area of water over on the right which is I don't know how yet to illustrate this is one of the reasons that I chose this piece. There's a couple textures in here that are. Kinda new to me. The rushing water near the foreground and then some of the areas that are like these shallow, reflecting pools in the back. Curious. How it's going to go hopefully I will be able to figure it out? Thank you crazy thank you. These rocks have some pretty cool patterns on them. So I'm going to select. Where I want to be able to brush in my lighter color? Sort of Terra Cotta. Color here. Some of that up here also. Yeah, the right we have a more warm warm colors. Well, except for obviously here of a Top left there's some really, really bright warm colors. But. The shadow on the left is pretty cool. I really like these little. Oh, that's too bright these areas of Red Brown. Cutting up into this big sheep. So cool. Maybe I should do something with this rock here to the right. So yeah, what I do is I've been painting for awhile on this layer and I think I'll just merge merge it down now. I really am only keeping that layer separate because I like to have little security blanket of being able to turn the layer on and off and see if I like it before merging so I think that's good enough. We could make a new layer now and start painting on it, and paint on it for a few minutes and then merge it down so. Um. I think the if I'm going to continue working big to small with the shapes. I think there is something sort of calling to me next and that is the water reflection. This area that I'm selecting right now. This is actually sort of creating a new shape. It's like a lighter lighter, Blue Purple and I think it's important to get that in so one thing you can do if you're doing reflection. You can kind of color. Pic from the Sky as like a starting point, 'cause that is where the reflection color is coming from make it a little bit more purple. Hot. So pretty I love this color. OK, so do that and then over here on the left we can color pic from the. The rock. And bring that in now, I'm only going with like the starting point of the reflection. I want to go in with actual paintbrush not the. Not the lasso tool and hand paint. Some of the really shiny parts. So we need like a hard edge brush for that I think. So yeah, we'll start with this and I'll just merge it down. But now it feels like we're getting somewhere. We can also work on the cloud. I think I'm going to flip the canvas again. Take a look from this direction. The cloud is really cool. I might switch to a brush. That's a little bit more something that looks more like a natural paintbrush. Something like that might be nice for cloud painting. The clouds are cool shape as a nice enerji to it. I'm going to pick like so one thing that I learned about painting clouds is it's nice to don't go quite for pure write a pure white right off the bat when you're painting clouds. 'cause if you do they have nothing left to to highlight too. So this looks pretty white against the blue so we'll start with it and then that way when we go to add like the nice pop of white in the brightest parts that cloud will still have a brighter way we can go to. I like the sense of movement in the cloud. It seems like it's. Like an explosion also part of the reason I left the these layers separate is so that I could. Easily paint under the rock here behind it, so. Another quick cloud painting tip, is if you choose the same or at least another textured brush for your eraser. You can erase out also not just painting, but you can also use your eraser to erase back into the cloud shape and create some interesting textures, and things. Hi Tim Oh, how are you? I'm not really in love with this cloud so far. I think part of the reason was because I got too excited about painting the little fluffy bits and it probably should have focused on the big shape like we're talking about the beginning to gesture so let's do that the gesture of the cloud is something more like this. So I'll focus on that instead of getting into the full fee bits. I'm sorry have a good dinner thanks for hanging out. And choose a different eraser. There we go. Need to do some cloud studies. Hopefully this man. I think part of the problem is. I really, really I really like clouds and I often feel like I'm not able to do them justice. You stop streaming on Twitch Nope, I still stream on Twitch. Alright there's also some little clouds down here. Appear. Sorry I think I like it a little more. I'm going to make it smaller we can really see you can really see the difference is when you make it smaller so I'm going to focus on I'm focusing on one thing at a time with the cloud. I'm not worried about the shading yet. I'm just painting the sort of like treating it like a flat shape. And. We can lock the transparency pressing little button up here and then I can pick like a blue Gray and we can start bringing some shading in. Timo monkey from Belgium, Oh, cool, yes, I do remember you I do remember you. Well thanks for popping over how you been. Right so starting to look a little bit more. 3D. What other brushes can I try? Maybe this fluffy one. I recently adopted some knew. Brushes so I'm kind of testing out the different different texture brushes on this cloud. Get the bright white over here on the side. That's working better. I like how this area in the middle is gets really thin and kind of separates almost detach is to that. Other little area of the cloud. I don't know why it's so satisfying but. It's really pretty. All right and then we get the purple clouds down here more in shadow. And my cloud looking at my clouds, it makes me wonder if I. Have the really the right color selected for the Sky behind there. I think that might be one of the reasons that. The Purple Cloud looks a little funky I'm not sure. So one thing I can do is check. Doolittle values check and check my painting in black and white see how it looks and I can also look at the reference in black and white so here's the reference reference picture. We can compare. It's actually pretty good. Sky in the reference seems a bit darker. I think it seems a bit darker, yes up Top, and a bit lighter right here. So, like there's a little bit more of an intense gradient. The area behind the cloud is darker. But it's not bad? So I did a little shortcut to change the painting into black and white. If you want to set that up for yourself, you can go to view proof setup. Custom and then make sure that your proof conditions. The device to simulate that you select working grade gained 20% and then click OK and then every time you press control? Why we have to turn your painting into black and white but the best part about it is, you can still paint in color. So you can still color pick and still paint in this mode, but it's going to. When you turn it back, you'll see that it's using the color that you select so it's really handy for that. Hoping cute emo. So let's let's do a little bit with the background. After that little review just going to grab the. Airbrush. Anne will go a little bit darker behind the cloud. Just because we're going darker doesn't mean to saturate more yeah that's better. And then a little bit later. And the edges here. And that should be better. Old cloud. Right I'm going to go back to my cloud painting so I wasn't quite done that. But I think with the Sky being. Fixed. It would be easier. One more thing the the. Rock here technically. I think this should be a little bit further. There's a little bit like wider of an area where we see through to the. To the Sky. So you can just kind of took this back here. Alright now some great whites. Wait, fluffy clouds. Degrees out. You want those little tiny light. Mini tendrils that are drifting away from the rest of the cloud. So painting in a racing out. Just very, very lightly would be nice for that. I'm going to flip and take a look from this direction. I think I like it. Going to go to. Warped. Open that up a little bit. One thing that I noticed a little bit in painting clouds is there's often one edge that's kind of harder. And then the cloud sorted dissolves away a little bit. So it's not necessarily a problem to use a hard brush. Old friend, the style your painting in you can basically do whatever you want. There's a lot of room for creativity but. Yeah, you can have one edge that's a little harder and then have to. The cloud kind of dissolve away out of that little bit. Alright I think I fiddled with the cloud enough for now, we're just going to. Move on and if we have time to go back to it, and mess around some more, we can. Thing that's OK. So I'm going to grab one of my brushes that I use for blocking in just a rectangle brush that has. A little bit of texture to it, and start working on the rocks on the left. It can make a new layer go to right click create clipping mask and. I think it would be nice to keep it on a separate layer just so that I can make sure I like what I'm doing. After adding new things and then we'll just merge down if we like it. But if you have any questions, you're welcome, you're welcome to ask me. Just kind of selecting some different hues, as I go through to add this striping. Hi Fabio, thank you. Kind of cool there's this line up here. It's like. This is a shadow. Around the rim of the Top of the Canyon. It's just all these interesting striping effects created. All the way back here there's a little shadow, pointing down. He seems really challenging it is there's a lot in it. I really like I really like this reference. But it's a bit, it doesn't seem like there's so much in it. At first glance 'cause. I feel like the point of view is like your kind of aimed down at the ground. Or it's a sort of worm's eye view looking up from the ground. I should say and. But there is really a lot of rocks and a lot of things going on. But if anybody wants to see the reference. I uploaded the image so it is a. Below the stream you should be able to find it if you're curious. It's from. Google Maps Street View. I found it through a website calledmapcrunch.com that I like to use to hunt for Virtual Plein air painting reference images. It's pretty fun. It's actually easy to get addicted to that website. It's very silly, but I like to click through there, you can click click go and just get like knew random places and it's really nice to use for painting reference practice and things. Sorry I'll merge that down and then make a new layer 'cause I kind of like how that went. And I think it's time to bring some of the highlights in on the left. I think that's going to give a lot more shape the reference. I have to admit the references a little bit overexposed. In some places. I still am using it anyway. 'cause it's just such a pretty scene that I decided to put up with that often times with the references really overexposed then I won't want to use it. But in this case. I was like Oh well, I was going to do it. It's hard to see what's going on in some areas in the reference on the left, but I think we get enough information to work from to make this happen. So. There's a rock coming down like this. Just going to kind of sketch in with bright. Color here. Also I'm going to flip the canvas because I think I need a little fresh view. What's going on over here? It helps. So we get some layers. Oh my goodness, I don't know if you guys hear that noise outside making noise. All right. This rock is facing towards the light so it's getting lot of brightly on it. I'm going to use the lasso tool to make some selections an paint this in the same way that I painted the rest of the rocks otherwise. I don't think it's going to look very cohesive. So. You hurted like what's going on over there is driving through the neck of his racing through the neighborhood, I should say. This is going to be a tricky one. I may have to zoom in so I haven't been zooming in on my reference. I have it open on my other monitor a little bit bigger than what you see up here is the thumbnail of course, but I'm just going to zoom in so I can work on this rock and properly. But I'd like to hold off on zooming in until I get to the end to get to the really detailed parts as I find if I zoom in too. Quick I get sucked in get sucked into details and I lose the whole scene. This is if I'm doing well. Honestly, this is true for how I paint in general, but it's especially true for fun doing like a time painting that I don't want to really don't want to get sucked in. But even if I'm doing just a regular illustration, you still want to keep like the whole. Seen in your mind. I do have a navigator window open. You can always go to window Navigator and then open this little mini window, which kind of gives you like a thumbnail view. I usually have that open on my other monitor just in case. So. Can look up at that. See what things look like if. Resumed in Oops color. All right. So I'm going to keep that rock on its own layer for a little bit more. I want to do some more work behind it. So it's easier, that way. There's going to be some other rocks, a whole bunch of am actually that pop up over here. Kind of come towards us this is actually something that I've been trying to workout. I do a lot of landscape sketching and. I really want to find a way to illustrate this type of rock more quickly like all these like River rocks. These smooth small rocks that have all different shapes, but they're kind of rounded or smoothed out flat different different shapes and it seems just it's always so time consuming to paint them. I've never been able to find like a quick way. To illustrate them at least if I'm going for a certain level of finish then I get stuck painting these rocks individually and. You know if you are if you're going to take a very painterly approach. The whole scene. Then you can do that. With the rocks too. But if I just come in here now and start painting. The rocks really loose. They're just going to look bad compared to the rest of seen that part looks nightmarish. I know there's so many rocks. This is what I'm like why did I pick this reference but it's so pretty? But there's like a million rocks over here, it will have to figure well to figure that one out. That's something where I thought about using like the? The mixer brush I thought that would be kind of cool. You could do the Bob Ross technique where you like you get the light color on Top dark color on the bottom of the brush and just one stroke and your River rocks boom boom boom super fast. But I I still haven't. Managed to to get them managed to get that whole mixer brush thing down yet so. Boo. OK, well, I think I will. Almost merge down let's see. Grab the airbrush there's a little reflection under the rock little shadow. All right. Let's see at 7:30 alright we're doing OK there's a lot left. But but I'm liking it. I'm going to take a break from this area, so I'm kind of a little bit working Top down. I guess as getting getting closer to us going to take a break from that left side an work on the big rock on the right and then we'll kind of pull it all together, I hope. That's the plan. Art new layer. Going to make a selection. And get this whole big rock in there. Not the whole rock, but the area that I want to highlight. And we're just going to. Take that late light blue that we're seeing in the Sky water. Start with that, we can also use brush that has texture. Oops. This is really pretty the rock itself had a lot of looks like it has a lot of texture and detail like little little dots. And then on Top of that late is reflecting on it, so. Honestly, we could spend a lot of time on this rock if we wanted to. But we don't want to. We just want to get the Gist of it. So it has almost like a little foot that comes out. This little little piece comes out? Kind of Balanced on there seems better. Alright time to flip. Alright that's not too bad. Anymore. Shadow underneath. And this starts over here. So there's a lot of rocks on the ground here, too, but they are so small and kind of a further away from us. So I think we'll be able to kind of hint at them with a texture instead of drawing individual rocks, so that's ideal. A little highlight back here. Try to get that perfect brush stroke only move on to a new layer. For it. Little later Pinker. There you go. Mill says do you ever look at a reference and get so confused it makes your head hurt trying to figure out? What is there? Yeah, I have experienced that definitely definitely. So if you get stuck with one of those there's a couple tricks you can use. I've heard people so one things that have been recommended to me before that. I don't really love to do, but is too like Squint Your Eyes and look at the reference. I don't really love to do that 'cause I actually get a headache from it pretty easily but. The idea is like you know to kind of really, really simplify it that way. But you can also like apply blur filters and stuff. So, like you can go to filter blur. You know, there's all different kinds of blurs you can choose. But put in a little bit of a blur it starts to. Simplify the composition a little bit. You can. Looking at in black-and-white sometimes helps that like taking away elements. And trying to break it down to the most simple thing. But yeah, definitely. And just remember you don't have to include everything I mean, unless you're doing a Commission work and the people that comparison, commissioning you has wants a specific elements to be in the artwork. You know if you're just painting a landscape and you feel overwhelmed by it. You know as the artist. I think you can make some decisions. You're allowed to say you're allowed to decide that maybe in areas too busy and it would be it would be better if it was. If you left some things out. And stuff like that of course, then you have to make decisions on what's going to be changed and that can be tough, but Sometimes I would even draw on a reference image and kind of paint over it and block out stuff or change things on the reference. So that you don't get confused from it when you buy it when you're working. Some I'm going to grab the Airbrush and do a little bit more over here on the left. This rock has some nice soft. Shadows. All those rocks, So what are we going to do? Well, I think what I'm 1st going to do is get rid of what I have here that's That's a bunch of nonsense. Wanna start over? OK. I just gotta try stuff I don't know I like I said, I have had a hard time figuring out. Up. How to indicate this kind of texture easily quickly and easily? I'm just going to try making some shapes some dark shapes 'cause I like to do dark to light simplify. Have minimize the amount of stuff I have to paint sometimes so I'm just going to make some shapes down here. And then we'll try making later shapes on Top and see if that works. Temaki Valley how are you? Thanks for coming. We're doing a? Desert virtual plain error. The reference is under the Stream if you want to take a look. But right now, I'm trying to figure out what to do with these rocks. Mill says I see working moving around the peace a lot. How do you know when it's time to move to a different part of the painting without getting too stuck on one part. I kind of there's a couple things I used to determine that one is I kind of go with the flow so as long as I'm working in an area and things are going well. I keep working there. When I start to hit a brick wall. and I really feel stuck and I've tried a couple solutions to the area and it's not working then I just leave. It usually and I'll work somewhere else. It's not quite as good as like you know, sometimes I have to take a step away from the painting and then come back with fresh eyes. It's a little bit of a like a mini version of that within your own painting. Just work on another area and then you can come back an see if it starts making more sense to you 'cause sometimes it does. Sometimes it's easier than another thing is I don't usually like to. Work so that one area the painting is like looks perfect in the other area. There's nothing going on. This painting isn't a great example of that 'cause be honest. I have worked that way. A little bit here where the foreground has very little going on an appears much more rendered so. There's exceptions to everything but usually I like to kind of work around the scene and I did it up here. You know, we worked on the cloud. A little bit. We worked on this side work and that side and we bounced around 'cause. I like to work on the whole scene and kind of try to bring it towards being finished. Um simultaneously. That way you have a better grip on how the values like the shading and the colors in the scene relate to one another and you don't get stuck like. Trying to figure out those relationships near the end or like force them if they're not working. So I'm going to start to work on the foreground now and this is going to be tricky, so this is one of the things that made me choose to paint this reference. 'cause I wanted to figure out how to paint this kind of situation. The rushing water in the foreground kind of coming towards us and the ripples that it creates an the little bubbles and all that kind of stuff. So I hope I can achieve that feeling of the water is really moving there. Might give some inspiration alright let's see got an artstation link. Oh, cool. Good vibes good vibes. Other desert desert scene. Yeah, it's always really satisfying the color combination in these kind of desert scenes, the nice blue Sky and like the Warm Reds and oranges. I like the one I'm working on 2 'cause. It's like you get the extra bonus of like some purple thrown in there and that's just perfect. For me. Yeah, that's cool thanks. Team I says, I was looking for a nice location on map French and I found this alright. I'm ready for some dog like with half his body has been overlapped by a boat. Sometimes the image stitching just has some weird stuff that happens, Oh team. Oh, if you want to share a link for map crunch. You have to click the share button and then copy the link that is there if you copy the link from the URL above it's not going to send the right image. So what you can do is click right here where it says share and then copy this. And then that will be the right one, 'cause I think it sent the wrong one from you. Yeah. Alright cool. Will get back to painting? OK, so these so right now, I'm just going to start with a darker shadows. Of where I see the ripples. I'm not worried about putting like every ripple in the right spot. But we couldn't get the overall feel this. Some more Brown here. Alright that should work this time. What's wrong with that picture? Does actually seems nice? I don't see anything wrong with that landscape Timo? When you when you're using map crunch you're going to get a lot of like side of the road road views because you know if you think about where the car is going. Order fact that it's your in the Google Maps. People are in a car traveling there, you get a lot of side of the road like kind of bland images, but then you also get like the most amazing pictures and people also upload images and stuff, I think that might be. You know where some of the really, really fantastic ones come from. But people will be on the boat on foot. You know, I've seen people like riding camels and stuff, he's taking pictures for Google. Maps years was a fitness studio, yeah, there's all kinds of stuff. Yeah, but sometimes you get something weird because the 3D or the 360 Panorama. View is created by them stitching images together. So, sometimes you have weird situations where stuff overlaps. Images don't line up quite right and I'll be like. Weird stuff happens, but I've painted with references with stuff like that. You just kind of leave so weird parts out and just do your thing. There's a little bit of a reflection over here that I think it's time I can get that in now. I'm getting into more detail stuff. Reflection in the water. The reference is really beautiful thanks monkey. Belly, I thought so too I'm glad you like it. Better hurry up so I have time to paint the greens and stuffing that extra little bit of foliage at the end is going to be really nice. So there's some little rocks and pebbles and stuff here just going to sketch in some. Scribbling some details. How much time is left? It's 746. And I probably will end around 9:15. So we have a bit of time left. Merge this down knew layer. And let's make a selection of this rock. There's one more rock over here that I think would be nice to include. Plenty of time for shiny parts? Yeah. We have plenty of time to add. A fun little finishing details and things. How's The Light? I can turn the light down a little bit. Sorry guys reaching over my tablet here. Delighted the Suns going down outside so it's making the lighting pretty intense from my desk lamp now. I think that's better. OK emerged that dumb and go to the next thing so recently. I painted some metal textures, and it gave me an idea even though this is not metal. This is water. Sometimes there are some similar things with like metal water glass? How they reflect in some situations. So Long story short, I used the smudge brush a little bit in painting. Some textures recently. and I think I can kind of try a similar technique here, even though it's a different subject. Think I cannot try that. Thank you crazy thank you very much. So if he turned the smudge brush up to a really high percentage. Sometimes it can really distort things a lot, which might be cool. If we want this like rushing water rippled texture effect. So. I think that could be cool and I really know if that. Alright so here's my idea going to test this out idea is I'm going to paint in a bunch of highlights roughly where they need to be shadows roughly where they need to be that kind of thing and then we're going to use the smudge brush to kind of like. Smash it together and try to see if we can make a cool effect. So it's almost like if we imagine this is traditional paint them like just going to put just going to drop some paint on the canvas right now and then we're going to. Smudge it around. Once it's on there, so I don't know how that's going to go but. Might be a total failure, but these kind of studies are fun to experiment with that stuff because. Why not? It's just a? It's a time study after this is done and it's this of no real consequences. So if something doesn't go well. It's not a big problem. And I will also do the same thing with shadows. Can put some? Random colors OK merge that down. Let's just see what happens. So I'm just kind of dabbing this much brush down lately. Honestly can't tell if this is doing anything I don't. I don't think it's working. But let's not let's not speak too soon flip it over. Actually, I think it could be kind of the start to something. Um. And grab a different brush. So I think one thing that's important is that we get the feeling of the water like rushing away or rushing down here so. Maybe a brush stroke that kind of makes it look very speedy. I see the paint stroke. That could work. I think when we add the foam of the water, the little white bits. They're getting turned up, I think that's going to help, too, but that's kind of like a detail that I feel like I have to go on the Top after we get the rest of it in. All thanks Mills. Even though the greenery is missing still looks cool thanks. I think with a desert scene. You could even get away with kind of like skipping out on that stuff because I think it feels finished enough. Just having like the warms warms and cool combinations like even without the green. I think there's enough for it to work. But if we have time and I think we will. Could be nice to pop pop them in there? But I'm glad to hear that it's seems to be working, even without them. Miss switch to a flat brush and. We have some braids blue. Highlights in the water. Maybe even more bright than we already have there and then. I think the cloud is reflecting in the water, too because suddenly we have. Like almost a warm color like a white. Reflecting. I wonder if I should use the? I'm going to race out what I just did. I'm going to try using the Airbrush and the lasso for this because it's so glassy smooth in the reference that I think my hand painting isn't getting the right effect. So I'm just going to select a couple like ripples like this. Grab the Airbrush and. Paint in We control age to hide the? Little dots. Maybe something like that. Can deselect and erase in and modify it now but I think this is a better start than what I was getting for. I want these ripples to come down an? Kind of they kind of turn into all this nonsense like it needs to become. Become one, it's all part of the water right now. It doesn't feel unified. Pick a little darker color purple. For the Some of these ripples. I'm turning up the water. And merge that down so. It is a little bit of progress. There's a rock here, too. Right here, but I don't know that I'm going to include it. I think it's maybe OK without it, so time to work on this last little corner over here. That doesn't really have anything going on at the moment, it's going to have reflection. So when I color pic from the Top left. Wall and use that as a starting point for the reflection color 'cause that's where the light is coming from. Just kind of paint in some ripples here. Maybe I could even use like overlay or color, Dodge or something on my brush might be nice to have sort of a? Saturating effect, which would be nice overlay. Can use the smudge brush to blend some of this and leave other things sharp? Yeah, I really I like having you guys here and you're welcome to ask questions and stuff but. It's also. We're making some good progress on the painting and getting a chance to. Really getting the stone here. Oh, what did you find out IMO? I'm scared whenever people link me random stuff in map crunch? I'm like? Wondering what kind of weird stuff is found it supposed to be you know, Google supposed to remove any. Anything too weird tickets up there, but Let's see. That's beautiful, Oh, I thought it made your emoji is the surprise face OK for me. I thought it was like a scared face. Yeah, wow. That's a really nice scene here. Let me show you guys what temo found. It looks like it's from like fantasy movie or something. It's really nice is like a bit overexposed. This happens, a lot, but it's still nice. Hi Pokey, thank you so much. Welcome. If anybody has any questions, you guys can let me know. But I'm doing a virtual Plein Air Painting. It's a place called Fry Canyon. In Utah and it's so pretty. I haven't been there in person. But he found this image on map crunch. Which takes images from Google Street View? And I like to do landscape studies from. From the references that we find there. And if you want to take a look at the reference. It's blow the stream. There's a link. I just made a screenshot so it's the same thing I'm looking at and. Bears. If you like it and you want to. Do a little study, or anything, you guys are welcome to take the reference and. Try it out. Complete with me. I wonder if I push that pink a little too far right there. I don't really at this stage want to bring in a lot of colors or really don't want to bring any colors that don't already exist in the scene. Just kind of want to stick to the pilot we have. Alright merge that down. Going to make a new layer fill it with black and put that on color Dodge mode. Want to do a little. Boost to the the lighting over here. Oh, thank you so much pookie looks very nice. My favorite thing to practice lately has been doing virtual Plein air painting and it really changed a lot of things for me. Got me to practice a lot of different types of scenes and things that I. Was kind of avoiding before? So I've been going to enjoy my painting more. Getting out of my comfort zone. Right so I think I like the extra little glow. That makes me happy. To make a new layer and put it on overlay, an kind of do similar type of thing. Spring a little bit of later. Purple glow to the left side. Just for some more atmospheric effects. 2 pink to pink. There we go it's better. I really like the warm cool contrast, so I want to boost that up a bit. Alright emerge that down so now we see starting to see bigger difference this year. OK, now, what to do with this water everything surrounding is starting to come together so. Here we go. I'm going to grab that actually let's try this brush. And there's a lot of ripples and things. So I think I'm I mean, you don't you guys if you. Wash my painting process before even just listening to me now. You know it's I really try to find like the efficient way of painting things. But sometimes there certain types of textures that you really just have to actually get in there and paint it. There's not so much of a shortcut to certain things you know. Released I haven't found it and this water ripples. I think I'm just going to get in here and paint. This sometimes it doesn't even take as long as you think and you're just making a big deal out of it 'cause I'm being lazy, but Lazy efficient kind of. Debatable. Daisy says a big issue. I have is I don't really paint with intent and make strokes and hope it looks good. I mean, I understand I think I think at some point we all like it's easy to kind of go into that autopilot mode where you're just you're just painting just doing your thing kind of getting his own. You kind of get into like a meditative state. That's part of the reason that I started doing that I'm studies because when I have a timer on I am less likely to do that. I'm more intentional with each of the strokes that I make 'cause I kinda have that idea in my head that it's like. I have to finish this you know, I have a timer on and I'm looking at it on my go have? You know 30 minutes left or whatever I have to. What can I do real quick to make this? Work. An after doing a lot of studies with that mindset, I notice that started per meeting. My painting process, even when I wasn't. Even when I wasn't using a timer. It just started changing the way that I was thinking. When I was painting, so and that makes sense 'cause it's like. You know if you're an athlete or musician any type of practice that you're doing like when you're practicing its practicing for when you're going to have some kind of. Like a performance or something uh game we're going to have to rely on like the instincts that you form and so I think it's like that with painting to like by doing these kinds of studies. It helps me it helped us change my mindset so even when I'm painting something that isn't. Timed I feel like I'm just a little bit more present with it. Because I am in my head. I'm like I don't know I'm just being being more aware what time I'm spending on what? Look at me, I'm painting all the way here in the distance when Meanwhile, foreground is being neglected. All right. Here we go new layer let's get back to it. There's some shines here. Reflections from the left. You need to remember that, yeah, I mean, it, I hope it helps a little bit. I might I think it would help you know when you're doing the study is when you're doing stuff your art club and things like that. Just you don't even have to be restricting your time necessarily but like for example, if you're going to sit down for a drawing session. You could just say like I only have like an hour or 2 to paint today and just kind of like notice what you're doing in that time it doesn't mean that you have to do everything is timed and you can only. To get this long in every piece, which is being aware of what time you're spending on stuff is good bless. It's useful later when you are doing Commission or something maybe? And people ask how long it's going to take to do something. If you if you've done some timed studies in time to work. I don't know it starts giving you a better idea of what you can do in certain amounts of time. Pokey says I like to create portraits and I never really pay attention to backgrounds. But it's definitely something I want to learn any suggestions on how to start yes. Oh my gosh. I was the same, like I loved painting people. An I did a lot of character portraits and things and I never I always put like an abstract background behind them or like something blurred out 'cause I didn't want to deal with it, but If you like what I'm doing here if you. If this kind of thing interests, you, it's called I would look into virtual Plein Air Painting. I know I'm always trying to sell people on doing this, but it's like been the most helpful thing for my art and I really enjoy doing it, but basically the idea that you're like, Plein air painting is like going outside and painting like in the field and virtual plein. Air is like your painting from an image of the outdoors and generally people use images from Google Street View and things like that, so I do. I do a lot of paintings of scenes from? Likemapcrunch.com, where you can get random images select random images and stuff, and do little study. From there doing time. Studies is really nice. Because you get a lot of benefit for the amount of time that you're going to be working on something. Most of what you're going to learn in doing a study or a lot of what you're going to learn doing a study is going to come from? The first like couple hours that you're working on it, and after that. You kind of just like texturing and tweaking and doing a lot of little things. But the most important information is coming from like the initial composition and block in and everything like that. But you're doing so, if you do, do some shorter studies take a reference and do. Here let me show you for example, in my artstation. Some of the past ones, and these are a little older now because. Well, they're not super old but I need to upload some more recent ones. But let me. Let me show you examples. So. These are just some examples of past paintings and these I've spent a little bit longer on like up to a couple hours like 3 hours. I think I usually will spend like an hour, an hour and 15 minutes on them and they've gotten a lot better. I don't have my very early ones online or I would show you but let's go to the earliest ones that I did upload here. Some of the earlier ones so you can see. Example these. They're a little bit more rough. And these are just from little bit longer ago. So. OK, I'm just catching up in the check those off on the tangent there, but basically so Long story short. You can do. Some studies image studies where you just don't spend too long on it, and like I would set a goal to maybe do 5. Like paint paint 5 landscape pictures that you like and maybe spend like a maximum of 2 hours on each one so that's 10 hours of painting an I think you're going to learn a ton in that time about lighting and. And you can set it up, however you want. That's just like one example of a way you can start to get a feel for things. Yeah, this is cool, but I think this kind of stuff is good like fasy. This is phase artwork that she just shared and I think this kind of setting is good for like a character like this. You don't really need to have a crazy background. It would maybe distract from the character and the characters taking up almost all of the frame anyway. So if you try to have a busy background. It would be really confusing to look at so. That's a thing sometimes portraits, it's better to keep it simple. Yeah, I like that I like that crazy. Yeah, Pokey you're welcome also, if you you know if you ever want to like if you come by the stream here. This is something that I'm planning to do on stream a lot and you're always welcome to join in so for example, you can take the reference. I share under the. Under the stream and You know draw paint that if you like. Paint paint along. But it's really hard to start painting backgrounds to your characters when you don't have some kind of foundation environment paid thing I think. And you don't have to go crazy, but just a little just little Plein Air Painting Practice is really fun. If you type in go to like Instagram and type in hashtag virtual pleinair you'll find so much good are Oh my gosh. I love searching that hashtag. It's great. Alright so I'm putting a little little shadows here find the ripples. Start to hopefully get some 3D effect. Sorry I think we're finally making some progress. I'm going to make a new layer and start painting the little bubbles. I think it's finally. Far enough for that. Nah here right the J fake name their art club portrait disaster alright let's see. Crazy so sometimes you're just out of the Zone 2 hours later this is my result. I'll come on are busy this is nice. It is not a disaster. Yeah, I think honestly to me, this is would be one of my favorite times to like begin working on a painting 'cause you already have, like the hard stuff figured out you already figured out the proportions. The everything is in so now you're just going to go in there and do some rendering is going to be nice. This is just this is just a classic example of a painting that is in like the early stages, so of course, it's going to look a little wonky because. There's a lot there's a lot of work left to be done. This is just this is just a work in progress. You're fine just gotta keep going just gotta keep going. Got everything you got everything in place there. Hi you're amazing for doing this reference thanks Mills. Monkey Valley says I found you through the gouache hast hashtag on Instagram. Around this time last year. No way that's so cool. I didn't know that or maybe I didn't remember if you told me that's awesome. Yeah, we are getting close to the time last year when I vary. So you must have found it found me really early 'cause I started posting gouache paintings in November. So holy cow that's awesome. Thank you Mary but I hated it that day, OK, I understand. We have, we have those moments with art. OK. Oh yeah that's what I was going to like what am I doing fun part. We can patient long enough. So I'm going to pick a light blue but it's all relative OK look at that. That's not even is way too bright. I'm going to color pic from this up here and just go a little bit later, little bit more blue. OK, maybe a little bit. Lighter. So I want to use this as the color for the little bubbles in the water. There's like little bubbles, trailing around the edge the water is getting turned up. I know right time is going by that's OK. We're still doing good. We're still doing good not time to panic, yet. At the time I was falling in love with Gouache Environment Studies. But I didn't realize that you stream until this year. Oh, OK, OK cool. I'm going to flip the canvas. I think it's easier. Sometimes I flip just to make paint strokes depending on it's easier for my right handed to do certain types of strokes, so yeah, I think for these little quick ones. This is easier and then there's all these little. Foamy bubbles. And ripples and things. This may be the first time I've seen it get dark at Maddys. Yeah, look at that it's getting really dark in this room. We can. Let's see. I can put on some fancy lighting for us. What do you think? What color? Purple red. What is the hardest thing for you to draw everyone ooh for me it's? Very technical stuff like if I were to draw like a car or weapons or something that's like has a lot of technical moving parts and there's a lot of' perspective and stuff like that. That would be really tough for me, then I would feel like. I don't think I would enjoy that too much. If I had to be like super precise with it if I could be kind of painterly with it and just kind of. Sketch it and have fun maybe maybe would be OK but. That's not really my Forte. I love painting natural things. So I think that organic natural scenes have a lot of organic shapes and things that can be. Can be? A little bit imperfect an it's not so problematic. I believe Mattie can painted Gundham Easilly, Oh my gosh well. Thank you for believing in me. I'll take it, I don't know that I agree with that, but I appreciate the vote of confidence. Man this is getting very busy this painting. Monkey village was capturing a likeness in someone's lips is Deceivingly. Hard yes and the Anna knows just just painting like this is hard. That's definitely true. And lips and noses. And stuff. Needs a texture brush for this area with a bunch of rocks. Painting guys is hard free Pokey Yeah, I I have a lot more experience painting ladies. Just 'cause I always liked to do it, so that makes it easier for me than painting male characters. I think that's just always the case like whatever you like to paint becomes easier for you 'cause you just do it more you enjoy a more you're willing to put in the time you don't mind the stuff that you don't like. You just avoid it, and it gets you want to do it less and less. It's just like you know, I posted another link Oh OK. Let me see. Alright, like this one better, but not done shading or anything OK. Oh, OK OK. Actually, you know what I think your proportion on the eyes did approve did improve with this one. Yeah, I agree with that crazy. Nice yeah. Good stuff. You post a link 2 and I missed it, Oh no. How did I manage that? Oh, there, you go Pokey says I usually use a color behind the image alright let's see. Oh, cool. So this is your art Pokey. You have a really cool art style. Yeah, I like how the background color appears in these little shadow areas under the hair an around the eye. That's pretty neat. Cool, yeah, thank you for telling me I'm sorry missed all the links. Um. Mill says the way you did, the water in the foreground with the ripples could the same technique be applied to the small River rocks in the reference. Possibly. Yeah, I think kind of in the sense that I need to just get in there and paint it. Thanks, I wonder if I'm missing something obvious, but I wish I could make my chat window, a little bit bigger because it's very. Because I'm missing some of your Your stuff sorry goods. Ha. All right. Can emerge this down at some point I don't know when I like accidentally merged everything so we're painting on one layer now everyone that's happening. I'm just going to make a new layer on Top of it. Phone it's Phone time. When I bring some more reflections in the water. All right. And there's just. There's just so much going on. You know, I'm just going to relax and just paint will get done what we get done. I think it's going pretty well. Yeah, well, I I like seeing what you guys are working on it's fun. Appreciate you being willing to share your art. Merge that down. You should have a teal background. Kay Ikaw teal. It's not like super strong not super bright but. That's what I got for you. I have a 3DS we U stylus that looks like the. LOZ master sword Legend of Zelda. All that so cute Oh my God, I love that. Going to paint some more. Brate reflections. I think we need some warmer. Yellow now so we've got the blue. Baby Oh. Well, it happens to me pretty quick, too, so I understand. Oh, I don't think that link is going to work Pokey. It did you upload that somewhere it looks like it's going to? Before dance I can try control. Yeah, I think you need to put a URL in there that we can. That we cannot click on. You know, I'm starting to think that those rocks on the left. Maybe aren't so important like so far. It's not really. I don't think they're really missing anything that the rocks aren't there So what I'm going to do is. I'm going to include some of them under in this shadow kinda area here. But I think it's going to be OK for us not to like include every rock or like the full number that are there? Thank you lighting technician. Yeah, you can leave him out, I thought so. Like it feels very complete without them and it might draw a lot of attention over to that area so. I'm OK with it. But I do think I need to switch out some of these. Things. Maybe put some more detail. 'Cause the rocks have these little the look that it's kind of worn or the little areas like chipping off of the rock. So. I'm glad to get approved of my idea. So I was thinking if I make a new layer I can pick. You know, maybe maybe a couple of rocks to paint in. And then that's it. Almost time for the greenery that's right. Looking forward to that. I just enjoy painting foliage of all kinds of subject matters. I find the. It's relaxing to paint I didn't always feel this way. When I was inexperienced that I would feel very overwhelmed painting it because it can have a lot of detail but. Yeah, I found some brushes that I like to use. Then it's not dependent on the brushes, but using texture brushes can give a nice boost the foliage without having to spend a million. Years painting it. I don't necessarily like using brushes that are intended specifically for foliage painting, but just ones that kind of have the appearance of. A traditional paintbrush type of look. And some of those are nice for. For indicating Groups of leaves, and stuff like that. Just smoking out some. Areas. Blending. I really like the smudge brush. He probably painted a forest worth of cheese. Repeat a lot of the trees. But I feel like I've painted more trees at a distance like this kind of scene where the foliage just kind of looks like Little Tufts. I need to paint more trees, like doing proper tree studies where it's like. Closer up to the tree and really study, the shapes of the trees. So OK there's a few different bits of foliage here. I'm going to start on the left. There is a dead Bush. That's very important to the scene. I'm just going to. Kind of scribble in with a sketching brush. The main shape of it. Main branches is on a new layer so I can resize it and move it around if I don't like what I'm doing. Jackson Joker says Hello, he's watching their forgot his password high. Jackson thanks for hanging out. I'm like Queen of forgetting my password on things don't get me started on that I try. I'm trying to be better, but I understand. OK, so we got this going to make a new layer and take a textured brush. Which one I recently have acquired some new brushes, they have interesting textures stuff like this. So. This could be a fun one to use for a kind of like Brushy dead. Bush kind of texture look at that that's cool. I like it. Make a new layer and go back to my sketch brush. OK, crazy cool. Anile sketch in a little bit of my own details there. So now it's making that at the push in it's kind of making this area behind it stand out as like? What's going on with this. Random color me builders get rid of that. Yeah, that could be better if anything, we can highlight behind there, so that the Bush stands out more. Things are going OK. I'm going to duplicate the Bush layer so it's easier to see. And I think we got our dead. Bush I made it bigger than the in the reference. Can also lock the transparency take the Airbrush and give it a little bit of a gradient? Hey Pokey, no worries. OK let's see. Top. Oh my gosh, guys look at this is what Pokey shared with me. Thank you I'm honored to masterpiece. Excellent I'm going to just save that. If I remember struggling and painting. I think I'm going to merge the Bush down. I think I like it. Nobody has said anything bad about it. So far, so let's move on, I think we're good. Let's go to the right side of the canvas. And. Do the same kind of thing I'm going to Stencil often area. So it makes it easier for me to paint with in that spot because for example. If I try to make marks for the foliage. I can't go below and paint over the rock so just creating little Stencil area. And then Yeah, over here, there's a bunch of little round like rounded Tufts of. Of color. And they're not so. Definitive as like there's one plant here, one plant here. We're inclined here. They're kind of like just all these little little Tufts so. Kind of make up. Little area together. So that'll be than you. New area and I'm going to keep this all on a separate layer 'cause. I'm not sold on what I'm doing here yet, but. I think with a little bit more layering it could work up a couple more painted some more detail. So we go with a little bit more blue green the further we get away from us. I'm going to probably be relying a little bit more on Blue Green 'cause. We're going to get that sort of atmospheric effect. And. Hum. Let's queue shift this a little bit. Yeah, a little bit warmer, maybe less saturated. I didn't feel like the foliage. I was painting in felt like it was part of the scene needs to be more affected by the environment, so a little bit more. Little bit more A? Warm colors. OK, so I'm going to make a selection back here of the shape of this. Bush or tree, I can't really tell based on how far away, we are. Use a texture brush we also want to give. Some shadow to the side. Kindly was talking about painting clouds earlier, you can do the same thing with the foliage use a texture brush to paint in an he's a texture brush to erase out and that will kind of start giving. Some interesting shapes and you know with trees and bushes, you're going to see through them a little bit, it's not like a perfectly solid. Mass. And that's one of the really pretty things about them. Is that the dead Bush this? Is the dead Bush? Let's not zoom in on it over here is a. Not fully dead, Bush but you know conditions are conditions are rough out here that boy yourself, either side. I mean at least, there's some water going through here. They've got a chance. There's also a Bush or tree coming up here. He their crawl, I actually have a plugin for my color wheel. Um. If you go oops well. Me, I just reset that. Yeah, if you go to window color. Recent updates of photo shop have added a lot to the color wheel so. The reason I originally got Coulouris was because a previous photo shop didn't have this but now now. Now it's here. So you can go to window color annual see you can have the triangle color wheel. It might be set up with a huge cube so if it looks like this, then you can just go to these 3. Go to the little drop down and then you can click sliders if you want sliders. RGB sliders HSB sliders ellaby sliders and if you want the. The color we all there's a triangle color wheel? Which. I prefer. So. I use I keep curious in because it has some other features that I like to that. I think are cool, but photo shop keeps updating and adding new features so pretty. Pretty happy with the recent updates. I don't know if I would have got coolers in the 1st place earlier. If photo shop had the triangular color wheel, but now now it's there, so yeah. It's pretty sweet. Yeah, no problem what brushes are using I love textured brushes these are some. Brushes that I collected overtime, I can actually give you a link to my brush brush set. Let's see. Here is a link to my brush set that has the brush I'm using now. I think it might download it if you click that and see. You said it download link. Yeah, it's going to start downloading. If you click that so don't click it and less you want my brushes, but there you go. You know, I don't know that I really. I think the foliage is like with the exception of the dead. Bush on the left. I like that one because it doesn't add a different color. It's like the same color is the rocks. But I don't know if I'm a fan of the right side all these greens and stuff. I kind of like it better without them. I don't know about you guys kind of sad 'cause. I was like really excited to add the foliage. It's not really doing much for me. I think what I'm going to do is turn off the layer and just start with some of the distant foliage up here there's some. Greens up Top, Here that I think are really pretty. So I'm going to try painting those in and see how that goes see if we like that. And maybe we'll keep it really minimal. Maybe we won't go all in with all the Bush is. Yeah, thanks Basey. It's always fun to play with new brushes. Yeah, I like foliage just maybe not the green color. Yeah, you know it's possible that I just didn't really. Didn't really grab like the best color? I mean in the reference. I think it looks nice. Like I like. What's going on there, but I don't really like? Why was ending up with? So I'm picking a lighter green with some almost yellows. And. Painting in where the the light is hitting these greens. Beer without if about a lot of foliage. It's yeah. I think I'm just saturating it, too much like if I go to image adjust oops with the layer if I can just just Hue saturation just just desaturate that I think it looks so much better. Are just going to too crazy? But I think I do think it's very pretty, especially in the original reference. These like layers and layers of green and the ridges of rock going up the side here, so, so pretty. There's actually some more. Details in the rock that I never that I didn't get to put in yet. Some darker. That's Wycliff's yeah. Really enjoyed this painting. Puzzled me and if you had a few moments but. End up liking it a lot. Gay Pokey Good Luck enjoy the brushes and I hope you have fun with your landscape. Those better with a minimal. Cheating. There is one Bush that I kind of want to try adding. Ah thanks crazy me, too me too. You got to appreciate the ones that they go nicely go smoothly. There's a there's a Bush coming out from here that has a very nice emotion, too, it's like. Like bending over and kind of blowing in the wind camping. With all your landscape experience how difficult would you say this one is? I would say this one is very difficult, honestly like. I mean, if the water is? I'm still not like super happy without the waters came out, but I am happy with like the cloud basically. Yes. Also see the previous painting like the process. It's very calming. Thank you so much. That's nice to hear I'm glad you enjoyed it. Thanks everyone for hanging out. Enjoy the painting alright, so I'm going to show some finishing effects. It kind of depends on the scene like what you're going to do as far as a little polishing things but actually there's one more thing with this rock. That's bothering me, I need a hard edge right there. I'm going to get stuck with like that. Last minute thing where you're doing a million little. Oh my gosh, I could spend so long on this piece if I let myself. OK. New layer. I'm going to put the layer on multiply and grab the Airbrush. And use a straight warm color. I'm just going to collect from like mud mud kind of color. And zoom out. And just kind of make a little bit moving net effect. We want to go too far with this, but it helps to draw your eye to the center of the scene going to color pic from the? Purple for the Sky so like before after 4 after and also lower the opacity if that was too much or you know. And then I'm going to make a new layer and play with may be having. A little bit and we did some color dajing earlier, so I don't want to overdo that's really easy too. But I was thinking. Maybe color Dodge at tiny tiny bit in the Sky is believe it or not right on the cloud that might be really nice thing to do just. Just the very Top of the cloud. Will little light hitting so it gets closer to that pure white? Thank you girl. Very calming voice it's very nice and soothing to see the process along side and take us on creative journey will thank you. I'm glad you guys enjoyed it. I enjoyed painting and hanging out with you is very relaxing. I don't usually. I don't usually stream in the evenings on my time, but it could it could happen. I like that very flexible we can. Hum. Stream whenever I don't know what time is good for you guys, but it's possible with regularity that I would start like a few hours early than the earlier than this. So I hope you still be able to come by but. Yeah, it was very, very nice. Yeah, look at that I like that. I like the glow in the clouds that makes me happy. Where else can we sneak in some color Dodge while I'm? Try not to over do it. Yeah, just a little bit of warm glow here. Sometimes it's hard to control 'cause when you use these layer effects sometimes they? They changed the Hue slightly usually it's 2:00 AM, or warm direction. But you don't always want that so. Sometimes it's better to just. Go on a normal mode and pick the color that you want if you know specifically what you want. But color Dodge has a really nice glow effect. So. Oh man. Right here. Dear Uncle, Highway. I don't know about that purple. One thing that I learned kind of recently is that using an airbrush and just making just painting. The glow on normal mode can sometimes be really nice too. I always used to instantly go to layer blending modes. When I wanted to add a glow effect sometimes normal mode is the best choice. It's just not the one we think of. Gives a lot of nice atmospheric feeling. We're screen screen, I think is kind of similar. We're missing shadow here. Yeah, that's a little something's a little. Should be a shadow under this? Kate will merge those and then. Finally, it's nice sometimes too. Go to sharpen or you can use the unsharp mask. It's easy to just kind of go to file sharpen I mean, filter sharpen and then. Skype if I It shows your brush strokes a little bit more crisp. How do you study atmospheric stuff just from a lot of photo studies? I think I mean plein air painting is like the best way to study that because I think it. Or just when you're outside looking around because photos can show it, but it's never the same. It's such a magical feeling and it's mostly you get it from when you're in. Spaces where things are you have something big, like mountains or you're able to see far away. Ann. Yeah, it's very it's very. Very beautiful an I think yeah, doing photo studies can definitely help with that. But just paying attention. When you're outside is going to help even more 'cause I think a lot of the effects are lost in photos. Unchecking transparency shapes layer from blending modes really brings a nice glow. I've heard that. I've heard that what I ended up doing my friend told me trick that I use a lot and it's kind of similar. I think it's a similar effect to what you're saying is like instead of putting the layer on color Dodge and just leaving the blank layer if you pop in a black paint bucket and then use color Dodge that way it kind of does, I think it does a similar effect? Ann. Well, I'll actually like that magenta what the heck was kind of nice. Maybe I'll leave it in. But yeah, I think it's kind of creating a similar effect. Wow, what a happy happy accident. Some nice things to do at the end to our. Like going through adjustment layers like right now, I'm kind of painting pretty destructively. Like I'm not using any adjustment layers and just going for it, but if you want you can. We can do that and then you can go back and change things selective color is kind of new to me, I recently started playing with this and it's just mind blowing what you can do like the way that you can icily and tweak just specific colors. Be quite the heck it's almost too much power like I start to think I'll never finish. An artwork if I let myself just start messing with this stuff 'cause. I mean, you can just go crazy. You can totally change. The feeling of your peace it's similar. But maybe I should experiment more with the. I'm checking the transparency shapes. I haven't like painted enough with it. Thank you pokey thank you. Was try be selective color? And mess with Big Green's really quick. I don't know if it's actually going to do anything. There's so few. Yeah, like those nothing OK never mind. Um. Yellows maybe Yeah, on the left. We can make it more yellow. The color Dodge gives a lot of magic it does Oh my gosh. I like to do. Traditional painting also gouache painting, I don't do like a ton of traditional mediums by love, painting in Gouache, an color. Dodge is like one of the things that I miss when I'm painting traditionally there's some things. I like better about traditional painting. It's some things better about digital but this is really fun is really fun effect. With traditional painting after really like plan out my want the lighting and glow to be throughout the whole thing. You can't just like, at the end start popping in stuff and having a good old time with color Dodge. Anyway I've got her Stop 'cause I'm going to sit here and keep painting this an. Yeah, I think it's done, I think it's done. Guys I'm so happy the very first painting that I did on stream here. I got to the end and it like I think I had to end stream where the painting was about like 90% eighty 90%. I think it still can be considered finished, but I'm a lot happier at this one. I was a new thing too. I wanted to figure out how to time. The painting so that we could like complete one in the stream and have it be be nice. So I'm going to try my best to keep doing that with this streams that I do here. So they can be like little episodes and they'll be like a whole painting done in one stream. We post this piece on social media. Yeah, that's a good idea. I can post it. Maybe not this evening cause. It's already getting a little late for me. I'm going to go go eat and just relax, but I will post it on Instagram probably an? Yeah, I can share that really quick in case you guys want to lookout for it. It go. You like to do acrylic in Gouache, I have to try acrylic. Um J so thank you so much Matt Eataly Group. Others great process and to comment to this column to listening to explaining. Gosh, the end of the day I can't speak anymore. Thank you so much for the nice comments. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Cool, well, thanks crawl is nice to meet you guys welcome new people and thank you. Mills thanks everyone for Cummings was really fun. I enjoyed it and I'll post. The finished one and yeah. I'll see you in the next stream, most likely the next time I stream here is going to be on Monday. That's the current plans so yeah. Thank you. Thanks cow banks everybody alright well. See you next time have a good rest of your day everybody bye bye.", "duration": 5510.7400000000025, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url":

Barnum back everything is running, I think. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened to BS like this software that I use to stream. Everything went red and then it just tanked. So I apologize. I don't really know why I crashed. That was weird. Usually have an answer, but it just happened. So anyway, let's go back to the iPad. So this is Part 2 of later fresh cake if you want to get the whole spiel as to what I'm doing, going the replace check out part one. It will all be there, likely wouldn't get too far into the stream. So here we go. All right, rock 'n'. Roll it with. What I was doing, where I think everyone is pretty much back in here already. Where did I lose everybody that was watching? I was talking about drawing the leg and what it was going to look like and how this person had a stroke as their pinkies out and. You know? Flexible. So OK, we're just going to start drawing. I'm sorry about that. Everyone. I feel really bad that keeps happening. I gotta look into it. Maybe it's My Internet. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I remember like what am I doing? I remember way back early on I was having some some crashing issues and it came out that my or the reason why my streams were getting closed out and hidden and everything was. I was like a like a like a sensory censorship kind of thing. 'cause I don't know. The forces that be at the hands thought that I was drawn something suggestive. That's what I was told. So I don't know. I don't know if that's what did it, but I was told that was fixed, so I think this time it was me. I'm going to say. It's a little too intense. There. See, This is why I like that. You know what? No, This is why I always do it this way. 'cause this light comes in front and then this leg goes behind and it looks way more cool so. My plan is not going to work like I wanted it to. All good. We're just going to make cool stuff. You missed the whole leg thing. Well, I apologize, but here it is and see. Yeah, you know, I also like part of this too. Everyone's home sorry. I'm looking. I'm reading Chris Chris. Your comment. I feel like everyone's home right now and streaming stuff and like. Internet providers or just getting their teeth kicked in so. You know, I chalk up a lot of failures right now to the current state that we're in. You know, as like a society with the virus and everything. Alright, let's extend this leg now, 'cause this anatomy makes no sense right now. And we're going to will figure that foot out when we get there. It's just a. It's just so I know where things need to go. Your body part placement maybe will actually hold on. It will do like a arched leg that can be kind of God. I've never thought to do that with a walking character really. I'm sorry you guys missed the whole like thing. I tried to reenact it, but you know I pulled something and I don't want to. I gotta draw and I you know, I need this leg to make the art like so it's just that you know I can't recreate it. I apologized. Alright, let's see here. Yeah, what's up man how you doing? I was wondering where you were earlier. I was going to ask about your new guitar. How you doing the Strat? And I believe you said it was like fire engine red or something Cherry Red. I don't remember. It's not awesome. Hi. Make a new layer. Let's lower the opacity of this, 'cause my linework always kind of is a little distracting when I'm all done and let's grab the color black for right now will change that later. Like very gradually taking its footsteps into the like you know common common usage domain you've got. Valve releasing their half-life Alex game, which is probably the biggest endorsement for VR that there's been yet and the more we get into the space the more you're going to need concept art. You're going to have people who can develop virtual environments quickly easily to get ideas across for presentations for concept art for actual development all kinds of things like that. I think that this can have value. And not just that, but also on the consumer side, having people more often using things like the rifts in the quests and the other VR tools. I mean, you can even do VR on your phone and open that up and multiple VR programs. It's more like I guess I don't know if you call it VR necessarily but it's becoming a lot more widespread and I think being able to. Do something like this in Photoshop, which is so easily accessible and just doing it right in your typical work environment is super cool. So I'm more and more falling in love with doing these spherical panoramas. And while they might not be the most like technically useful. Uh illustrations, you can't really quickly, import a scene like this into a VR space like in blender or in my like you can't. You can't really use this for modeling. It's much more like just your standard concept art that you'd see for a game pitch or anything like that, really just in a pseudo VR environment, so that's I think got a lot of value to it. And with all That being said. I think I'm ready to get to painting so there were a lot of bumps in the roads up to this point on the first day we ended up getting something made but it was just such a a choppy awkward experience, I didn't really have a good workflow. We were just discovering it. It was a slow learning procedure for. Hopefully both you and me. Day 2, I had some research I knew what I wanted to do I knew how to do it, but the actual like execution of that was pretty bumpy. We had a few crashes. Some hardware problems as well as seemed like my computer just isn't. It's not a bad PC, but it's not quite up to doing like large resolution fully VR things on its own and streaming. So now I've got the second workhorse PC to do the streaming and coding for me, I've got my primary PC here for just the one task. It's got one goal in his mind and that's to make a panoramic photo sphere. And I think it will workout I think it'll workout alright today and in fairness. I already did the sketch and the hardest part is doing. The sketch because of the latency because of the intensity of the simulation of the textures in the sphere. So now if we just do a painting it should be pretty straightforward like from this point on it should basically just be any other painting and photo shop just in the fact that it's. Kind of weirdly distorted right that's the one thing about this so. We're going to play around with the offset we're going to play around with getting some nice textures, and paintings going on here. I'll talk a little bit about the inspiration for this particular piece here. I kind of had in my mind. Imagine you're in some sort of like not really a ship, but like a small floating platform that's got like like like a boat like a motorboat except in the Sky and surrounding you are all these rich pink yellow clouds very fluffy very. Warm and comfortable alongside these whales that are flying above Yuan. It's a very fantasy environment and I think it's going to be. It's going to be tough to do, but I think it'll be fun, as well. and I think what I'm going to also do is up to this point, I hadn't really tightened up my line art. I think I have a lot of opportunities here to make the line art a lot sharper and cleaner and overall a lot better. I'm going to try to really get a good presentation here and that's going to be my focus making sure that it. Looks good. And then we're going to make sure that it feels good in the VR space. An I think in general. You should probably flip those priorities. You should make it feel comfortable first. But I think it'll feel comfortable anyways so. If I can make the painting itself look nice. I have high high hopes for how this is going to turn out so this will be my second attempt at a properly nice looking photo sphere illustration. So again we've got about 2 hours today to work on this. So again we've got about 2 hours today to work on this. I can go over if I really feel like I need to put the extra time in but I think will be OK with just 2 hours for this. I can go over if I really feel like I need to put the extra time in but I think will be OK with just 2 hours for this. I'm going to start out with. I'm going to start out with. I think I'm going to focus on the colours 1st and then I can add my tightened up line art after that. I think I'm going to focus on the colours 1st and then I can add my tightened up line art after that. We've still got the Christmas lights up to celebrate our December. We've still got the Christmas lights up to celebrate our December. The ending of our December and then maybe I'll get some cool firework effects for new year. The ending of our December and then maybe I'll get some cool firework effects for new year. I'm going to have a pretty busy January. I'm going to have a pretty busy January. So I might not be able to put too much time into making that look spiffy, but I think it'll be alright so with That being said. So I might not be able to put too much time into making that look spiffy, but I think it'll be alright so with That being said. Let's just go ahead and start blocking in some colors. Let's just go ahead and start blocking in some colors. I'm going to keep actually the first thing I want to do this is the first thing I like to do in every painting now that I've learned that is important is to get rid of all the white all the white is actually an Alpha. I'm going to keep actually the first thing I want to do this is the first thing I like to do in every painting now that I've learned that is important is to get rid of all the white all the white is actually an Alpha. It's not transparent. It's not transparent. I could set my line art to multiply that is an option, but I think it's just. I could set my line art to multiply that is an option, but I think it's just. Much more simple to just get rid of all the white. Much more simple to just get rid of all the white. So pretty quick and easy Oh yeah, now that we have a project open. So pretty quick and easy Oh yeah, now that we have a project open. I can enable the tool timeline so those of you at home, watching the video after can keep up.

It looks pretty good in the VR environment. It looks pretty good in the VR environment. There is one problem, though, is that maybe up towards the Top.

I have a whale above the viewer so that might get a little bit weird looking but I can fix whatever I need to in the photo sphere itself, so again select color range.

We're just going to select the white. We're just going to select the white. And then press OK. And then press OK. And then I like to use a action that I made I might even do a video a stream, about actions. And then I like to use a action that I made I might even do a video a stream, about actions. Lots of people have done them and they've done better than I have. Lots of people have done them and they've done better than I have. But you know if you guys want to see what my opinion is on him. But you know if you guys want to see what my opinion is on him. I'll be happy to do that. I'll be happy to do that. But my action here is set to F-10 and that is set to expand my selection by 2 pixels, which is generally pretty good. But my action here is set to F-10 and that is set to expand my selection by 2 pixels, which is generally pretty good. But in this case, maybe a little bit too much so I'll just do that a couple of times. But in this case, maybe a little bit too much so I'll just do that a couple of times. And then maybe just do a select modify expand by one. And then maybe just do a select modify expand by one. And that's a much cleaner much cleaner cut out. And that's a much cleaner much cleaner cut out. And there are a couple of options here again. And there are a couple of options here again. We can just do multiply and put that above everything and now if I paint back here it should. We can just do multiply and put that above everything and now if I paint back here it should. Let my colors through as they are there shouldn't be any variation to the actual color? Let my colors through as they are there shouldn't be any variation to the actual color? Some blending modes you'll have that issue where like overlay for example, if we pay here it won't be the exact. Some blending modes you'll have that issue where like overlay for example, if we pay here it won't be the exact. The exact read that I initially put down. The exact read that I initially put down. So multiply is pretty good for that white basically does nothing to your to your colors. So multiply is pretty good for that white basically does nothing to your to your colors. But as the as the values get darker. But as the as the values get darker. It begins to affect that and you can see that effect happening with like these Gray lines in the black lines so for the most part will be able to keep our wow. It begins to affect that and you can see that effect happening with like these Gray lines in the black lines so for the most part will be able to keep our wow. Are colors just how we want to? Are colors just how we want to? I think I want to start with just a nice a nice of wash too. I think I want to start with just a nice a nice of wash too. To get us some? To get us some? Get us some base colors in. Get us some base colors in. When is my trusty watercolor brush and just start pushing around some nice nice pinkish Sun City colors all around?

It feels a little bit dishonest to call this a spirit Panorama stream when really it's just a normal painting stream. It feels a little bit dishonest to call this a spirit Panorama stream when really it's just a normal painting stream. But. But. What it does and the going into is pretty important? What it does and the going into is pretty important? The way I'm actually doing all this is pretty much critical to how the end result will look in the photo sphere. The way I'm actually doing all this is pretty much critical to how the end result will look in the photo sphere. So maybe it's not too dishonest, but So maybe it's not too dishonest, but People might show up thinking to themselves Oh boy. People might show up thinking to themselves Oh boy. Let's figure out how these panoramic photo spheres. Let's figure out how these panoramic photo spheres. Look and let me see. Look and let me see. I'm just painting. I'm just painting. So I feel like there's a burden that I have to carry to make this look as a engaging and interesting as possible so. So I feel like there's a burden that I have to carry to make this look as a engaging and interesting as possible so. That's what my job is. That's what my job is. It's important to remember the distortion when you're painting, these an my base line art has done a good job of helping me know how the shape should work I did draw it all in the photo sphere itself, so it should have. It's important to remember the distortion when you're painting, these an my base line art has done a good job of helping me know how the shape should work I did draw it all in the photo sphere itself, so it should have. Its natural expected distortions based on the closeness and furnace from the Camera. Its natural expected distortions based on the closeness and furnace from the Camera. But I would like to make sure that my considering that for example, my brush strokes. But I would like to make sure that my considering that for example, my brush strokes. Here are all based on this 2D plane so they don't get to get that distortion effects will have to bear that in mind as I'm putting my colors in. It's it's a thing that you'll just learn as you get better at doing these is what I've expected will just kind of learn the in's and outs and the little ticket. Dillow is that come with doing a photo sphere painting. Oh, I also want to give a quick thanks to a few people we had a few follow since last time in the last 8 hours Paloma. Follow my work. Christian sylvestris Sylvester perhaps appreciated my frog my frog metamorphosis series and Martin did a follow as well. So thanks to all you guys for doing that. I've still yet to actually. Set up any alerts but it's not too much of a pain to just refresh. My Behance page. OK. Let's start getting some I'm not too good at doing paintings, but I'm going to try my best here to make this look. Fairly nice. Actually, I really don't do paintings very often, so this is a good experience for me. I think a good good bit of practice an incentive to get some bacon practice in. One cool thing that we can do is if I ever want to preview how this looks. It's there's not like a very simple like on off method. You'll have to flatten all your work and then create the panoramic sphere. The spherical Panorama. I keep calling it the. Panorama sphere, but it's a spherical Panorama you can. Turn it into that and then you have to undo the flattening and the conversion. So it's not the most straightforward workflow for it, but it's not too bad either. And I'll go back and forth. A little bit there. There is an alternate mode of doing these types of Panoramas, but they've streamlined it with the simple create. A Panorama layer they've streamlined that quite a bit before you have to you have to go into your 3D make a new sphere keep that a texture and then edit the texture and it was all a little bit awkward and a little bit confusing to figure out and while it was a lot more open and its Accessibility. You could change your cameras perspective. Quite a bit more freely. You could do a lot of things that you can't really do with this new version, but there's nowhere version is much more streamlined and convenient to use if you don't really want to get too technical. I would like if there was a better middle ground between the 2 but. Again, this is the type of thing that not a lot of people really have much interest in learning or even utilizing at the moment at least so I don't really expect the team that's building photo shop to worry too much about that. But I hope that they do I hope that I hope that my streams my streams here will be? Interesting enough for you, that you feel like you're also interested in making these yourself and then we can get enough of a following on these types of 3D paintings. And then the team at Adobe will be like wow. People really like doing this now. Let's let's make this even better and that would be really cool. I'd love that. That's the plan that's my. That's my secret agenda. To get more people to try this out, and give feedback to Adobe. That's what I'd love to have. Together, we can do it. Alright let's. One thing I can do I hadn't thought about this yet. This is a new a new idea for Maine, we can actually upscale this? By about I don't know 200%. And then we can shrink it back down and put it into the photo sphere again after and there should be very little consequence to that. The main issue, I had was having it at a high resolution. It wasn't so much opening it in browsing it. It was about the lag of actually trying to draw and paint in that mode, so just viewing it at a higher resolution is not a big deal. So this is probably a much better option. And in fact, I could probably go as large as I wanted to, I can again. My PC is reasonably beefy. It's it's OK at doing a lot of high res painting, so I could probably like. Pain as high as I want. To get as good of a resolution as I can. OK. Let me try to get I like to have my guides on to remind me where my. Where my ends and outs are for the distortion, but I think I can probably get some good painting like this? I do have a cloud brush that I often use. Let me just try a little bit of that. I don't like to rely too much on these preset brushes, but If it helps me get a good texture that I like I'm all about it. One also important thing that you can do. Unlike with the typical photos here painting if you're inside the photo sphere. You can't make multiple layers. You kind of have to paint on Top of everything an I really disliked that. But if you open it up in this 2D flat view. You can add as many layers as you want. It's just a regular photo shop image at that point. I find that the job that painting in the photo sphere does the best is giving you a good layout for your sketches so you can know where things should fit and where they distort before you start to paint. So I have. No issues here as far as painting goes. And I bring that up because I was thinking to myself, what, if I want to change. This this red background. What if I want to add more of a watch texture and. As it is now I've kind of. Kind of our corner of myself. It's not too late, though. It's not such a bad idea to just. Go with the flow. I have a lot of respect for people who paint on canvas with traditional paint because you don't really get a lot of options to change your underpainting once you started things on Top. Well, you can, but you have to also spend an equal amount of time to redraw and repaint everything that you did up to that point. I think it be a good experiment to just use. One one photo shop player for everything I know some people do that. And some people prefer to work that way. But not me. I feel like there's too much pressure. If I use just the one layer. And that that's not what I need when I'm working you know. I imagine at some point. The anxiety will go away, but No need to attempt it. So I think we've got a few clouds. I've got a few clouds around here that I'd like to get in. I wish I was better at painting clouds. That's one thing I've never really been good at. Or as good at as I would like to be. I'm good at making loose. Fluffy looking. Bits of color, but I don't really think they ever looked too much like clouds. I think it's mostly in the. Pinks. The darker values where the clouds really start to come out, but I'm so bad at doing that. If you're good at painting clouds. Hit me up send me a message. And I'll just pay you to paint all my clouds for me in the future. Again, I've given myself about 2 hours a day to do this so there's no need to rush. I should try to get these looking as good as I can. I think the best way to sell a concept is by making it look really good right. Even if the concepts bad if it's got a good presentation. Then uh. So I think you can solve that's not really the case here I think that the. The concept is better, so far than my presentations have been but. Sorry. That's alright. It's often things out a little bit more. OK, not a bad start. I want the clouds. Appear to be a little bit closer. I'm going to make those a little bit more higher resolution little bit more detailed. Whoops. Objects that are closer to the Camera have a much. Higher dynamic range so you can really spend the time. To get all those rich colors in there. Get some harsh harsher shadows get some tighter. Tighter brush strokes. Whatever it takes to make that look a little bit. Little bit cleaner. A little bit closer. But more saturation II. You can't really see it here. Maybe it's visible. It's incredibly hard to tell but I think up here is where my light sources or light source is. Back and sort of to the Top. And to the right a little bit, I think. It shouldn't really matter, too much for these clouds because the light is going to be mostly coming from above anyways, but it is important to remember. In most cases, the lights going to be above but sometimes you know, maybe we're above the sun. Maybe were upside down. You know you never really know unless we specify. But in this case, the sun is coming from above. And I might even get a little bit more light on this side of the cloud 2. I may add a little bit of. Light shadow you can kind of see that these 2 are fairly far apart, but not so far apart that they don't affect each other. Shadow Wise. Not looking bad, not too bad at all. Let's just give a good quick proof of concept here, I might add a new layer on Top and I'll quickly drop in a rough. I think I had in mind like a military kind of green color. For this vote for some reason so I'll just go with that and will just quickly drop in a rough shape. Thank you. Just a very quick. Rough indication as to where this is going to go. And then we'll take a quick peek at how it looks in that environment does that sound. Because I haven't actually shown off what this looks like. There. I will block in just very quickly just some tighter. Tighter values here, so you get a much more clean idea what the deal is here. Just to indicate a little bit of volume. K. I probably won't even keep these. I don't even keep this layer probably so there's not much sense in. Making the details to type but. I would like it to feel a little bit more. Like a like a space you would be in. Yeah. OK, that looks good enough there just turn these on I might keep my. My lennartz very loose like that I also going to. Save this. Just in case anything weird happens. Will make a new Panorama layer from selectors. I've merged all my layers together? You don't have to merge them necessarily you can just select the mall. But I think it will ultimately do the same thing and combine them into one texture. So it doesn't really matter. I think which way you do it. I'm sure there's a lot of interesting things you might be able to do like for example, making your layers into a smart object that might. That might not be a bad idea because you might be able to alter the smart object as a 2D plane while still being able to save it actually you know what? Let's just try that I've got. This is interesting. This is an interesting concept, so we go to 3D Spherical, Panorama, new Panorama. And this will make a combined. 3D image. And we'll see if my if my concept of using another PC to take some load off is valid or not. We're looking alright, so far. OK, I will just take a little peek around yeah, there, we go. Let me zoom in a little bit. So we've got the Sky. There's my son, there, you see the sun. There my rough rough sketch of that. Let me go into perspective field of you make it a little bit higher. There we go. So now if I click on textures. Click on spherical map, perhaps I'm trying to find a way to possibly. Edit this texture, an if I click on 3D is it 3D. Let me go to the. The window workspace 3D here. And there should be a option. To view The actual material. That might object is made of. And we'll just see if I can open that up, it should be like a diffused layer. Um. And my hope was that I could actually open up. This smart object as its original layers and then make edits to that that will update in real time over here, but I don't see an obvious way of doing that, yet. Um. Let's just keep looking though I'll keep looking we've got 3D. Let's put this up here. Now typically you'll be able to see. You are mesh, which in our case is a sphere. You can normally see that and a typical 3D workspace. But like I said it seemed like they made some compromises to make it a bit more simplistic they changed a couple of things to make this a much more straightforward workflow and again this is a thing that I think. Needs a little bit more compromise to make it a little bit more useful. To make adjustments to but it's seeming like I'm having a hard time actually. Like expanding the mesh itself. Which I think would be tremendously helpful? Properties yeah, we don't really want to mess with the properties. There's nothing in there for us to use. I was hoping that maybe double clicking. Oh, this has opened up the. The texture now. I wonder if I were to make an adjustment here. It is rasterized this and put like a big, Big Green Line there will that. Oh yeah, OK that's kind of updating in real time isn't it, it's a little bit slow, though. It's a little bit slow and that's something I want to avoid if possible, so working still in that in the 2D and then converting it might be the better way of doing it still. But this does seem kind of like a valid strategy so again to get into their let's just undo that I just double clicked on. Something in here, I don't know if it matters. what I click on so far. I'm clicking on spherical map. I'll click on textures now. Yeah, it looks like you'll need to actually double click on spherical map. To open up. Or even even previews it for you, if you hover your mouse over Top. Or it's right as soon as I clicked on it, there, it is so it does preview for you what you're working with there and then you can open this up and while I elected not to save the changes it still apply the changes anyways. Which is kind of annoying? But it does seem like a valid strategy so let me just. Can you open up my? My history here and we'll just go back to the point of hopefully it's still an option of going back to? Maybe it's too late. No this is fun OK. Cool. So now we have our? Our base painting still available OK perfect. Yeah, it is a cool concept Martin. How's it going? It's a cool a cool thing that you can do. I'm still getting good at a Actually, implementing it but I think it's I think it's very promising so again what we can do is. Um. Let's just try it. I'm going to try to do it without making a smart object out of it. So will go to 3D Spherical and new from selected layers and I think that this is going to combine the two layers. So now we can look around. I'm not going to do that. Every time you move your Camera. It will save that as a as an action. So you don't want to move too much around because you might lose track of where you were at but now I'm going to open up spherical map and see if the two independent layers are preserved and it looks like they are so that's really handy actually and this will allow you to. Make real time changes to your. Panoramic photos fear spherical Panorama. Which is cool for sure. But let me let me open these up side by side and see if you can see the real time changes how's that sound just put that there? And in pain like. I'll just move our view over this way. It's just very slow. That's the one problem. It's a very slow render. Yeah, that's like almost instantaneous so if you had it even before your computer. You could probably do this all in real time and you can even move this up to like a second display and. You could look around in real time and see what your changes are of course, you can't see my second monitor, but I've got the whole photo sphere being rendered up there. That does seem like a valid strategy, although again for Maine, a little bit choppy not ideal so. Let's just. With this back here. Close this. And I won't save the changes. But I will undo this a few times. We'll just go back to here. This is back to our. Regular flat and painting. And I'm going to get back to work, but that is a rough idea of what you can do there. Very very nice I'm going to actually take a moment to use the restroom. So I'll be right back and we'll get back to painting this out a little bit more once I returned so please stand by. And I'll be back very quickly. No. Hello. I'm back. I I got suddenly very deeply hungry. And I don't know where that came from. I have to deal with that as soon as I'm done streaming. It's a today is the 7th right, the 27th rather the 7th day of the 20th. Day it is. Things should be open again now right now that the Holidays are over. Things should be open now. Let's go back to my default workspace because I prefer to color in that workspace make sure the tool timeline stays on. And I'm just going to delete this. Rough craft layer not really. Liking that so will tighten it up later, though, I'm going to make. Let's make a couple of groups groups are nice will make a couple for the? The background. Will make one for the will just called the Boat? And then one for the whales. At least for now, let's move. This guy into their I'm not color. These I don't often color my layers. But when I do. It's really nice will make the background. Red will make the boat like green because it for whatever reason. That's the color. I'm associating with it and the whales will be blue because whales tend to be kind of blueish don't they? Uh so anyways back to this point, I'm going to drop this down a little bit more even. And Uhm. Let's think about this a little bit. The colours looking alright, so far, but I feel like my richness is a bit lacking. So I'd like to make a new Hue sat layer just bring it up a little bit. Get a little bit darker to me. Will just work with that for now. And. Let's see. I want to have. A little bit more. This isn't a typical landscape painting right so I have to think a little bit more about. Where my richer values should go? Let me just bring a little bit more lightness to the Sky and grab my cloud brush again. Bring this up a little bit. So, in a little bit. The gross and net. Just bring those up. Dromio pasty a little bit drop the flow of it, too. Make it apply a little bit more gradually. And I'd like to get these red and start to bring these Reds down a bit. Again, I am getting to that problem of. My. My my clouds are getting in the way of my my background Wash. It's a little annoying but I think I can work around it. Just push and pull some colors here in there. Here and there is like basically my catch phrase for whatever reason, I don't. I don't know why I've been saying here and there, so much. It just I don't know. Maybe it feels a bit Bob Rossi, just got some nice. Uh just some nice variations of colors here in their daughter in little bit here and there. Should I embrace it? Or try to stop saying it so much. And I'm just a Put it dabs of color here in there. Maybe I should keep it. All these clouds to feel a little bit more. Let's put a soft light over Top of a little bit of this just bring out some of these orange is just a little bit. How tall they feel like a big a big dreamy Sky landscape? Put some of these Purples into. 10. It's not too much, but I think a little bit doesn't hurt. OK. Too bad. OK. Um. Not not too thrilled all the way through about these clouds, but it's not a bad idea to just move on a little bit and then we'll come back to it later on. I want to start blocking out my Wales now. The wheels are going to be pretty important, and I'm thinking. I want to go for a pretty typical like. Navy blue color for these guys. I'll start with giving them a pretty tight. Pretty tight outline. Make sure that this is turned on. Bring up the flow and you'll pass it will just block him out pretty tightly to start with. And then I'll make him a little bit less tight as time goes by. Now I didn't do any whale anatomy for this and the whales might end up looking up a little bit weird. Uh but That's just a something will have to accept I think. And then do any studies for these guys. Just hope that they end up looking alright. Something wrong with using references but I didn't really want to bother with it today. Enough. So there's the first one. I might end up deciding to go into. The photo sphere mode to identified as shapes of my bigger one. I think like I don't know if this is part of a whale. I'm not entirely certain so I might just need to go make sure that I'm getting a whales all the way through. OK, where's the rest of my way. LA is this part of them. I think he might actually extend and there's a little bit of whale over here, too, so just push that out, an I'm going to later. Go into the offset filter. And make sure that. The painting is even in Nice, and looks good. I did a bit of that yesterday or I guess the day before yesterday. But I will I will redo that I'll do it just right now actually let me. I don't really need to worry about everything else. When I do this so I'll just do filter. Offset. And then my workspace is 7200, so again I'll just do some math and here in the actual like slider, so I'll do 7200 / 2 and then apply it. And I might even do the same thing for my sketch just so I know. So it's Control Alt F to apply the filter. And then we'll just undo this when I'm done. No problems had. Oh, I see so all of this here. I think is actually part of the whale. It's a little bit hard to tell isn't it that's the problem with having objects directly above the cameras. They tend to warp really weirdly. So I might just have to spend some time, reminding myself. What the deal is? I think just. Straight across you're actually if we look. I think that this is the whale instead. I think that's in there. I don't know what this shape is, though, I don't know where that comes into play if at all. But yeah, so this is where you can really see that this is not a typical painting where you. You just do your typical. Drawing and you're good to go. There's a lot of stuff going on here like from this perspective this well, just going off. That way you know what's even doing what's? What is his involvement in this whole scene. Well, when we actually look at it in the correct space, he will indeed be going the correct direction. And right there. And this is where your concept of where shadows and lights hit really gets skewed because. The Top of something maybe the bottom of something else. And that really space so. Important to remember where everything is meant to go. I say that as if I'm professional but I really. I'm really new to all this. I'm just kind of reminding myself? How all this is meant to work. It really is super cool, though, to paint something. And then be surrounded by that painting. One of my favorite things weirdly to do in VR is just to like sit somewhere nice. I don't know why it's just something that I like to do just go to the. Like the steam desktop and open up different different environments. People have loaded in and just hang out in those it's just really nice. Not a huge fan of like a lot of VR things like to make it feel like you're in the middle of something dramatic or there's always something going on. There's not a lot of just enjoying yourself types of games and I really wish there were more. I would love to play just some nice simulators, so nice clean simulator games. Like I think it be fantastic to have a VR game where you can just do some sniffing like that's all. I want just let me Smith and I'll be happy. Let me do some Blacks. Oh, there's a whale here, too. It's been really weird. It's The weather has been really weird. I'm living in the Midwest and. You know it's December typically in the Midwest. It's pretty cold in December. I know some countries, it's actually really warm like S America for example, is been pretty hot. From my understanding. But here in the Midwest. It's typically quite cold like you know, freezing snow that those are all things associated with winter here. And most of North America, too. I imagine but it was like so warm last night that I actually left my window open and that. I will I won't make any opinions about that. But it seems it seems a little alarming. I don't know. I'll leave that up to other people, the professionals. I guess not some random whale painter on Behance. Draw your own conclusions, I suppose. But man I don't dislike it right now, but I might in the future who knows? I'm going to do my offset for both of these were back to the way we were got all these whales hanging out and having a good time, I'm all about that having. Having a whale of a time. Um just hide the scheduler real quick, yeah, this is looking alright. This is looking alright. Um. I would like to make a new layer and want to make this a clipping layer very handy. And I'll just start. Come on. Come on, there, we go. Going to start blocking in some of the values for the whale here, so it's a darker colors at a little bit of purple just a little bit of purple to my value there and I'll get a? See. I want to get something pretty light. I think that maybe this softer round could be what I'm looking for. This may call for another increase of resolution, though. They should use a multiply layer for this. Total multiplied to do my blending. Shadows. That's probably going to be OK just right there. Something like that, it's going to be tough to get the actual tailfin again. I'm not a very good painter, so please bear with me. Not really sure how much I want to. Push these shapes back. Kinda feel like instead of adding the shadow there, I'll end up putting a highlight there instead. Might be that it's not better idea. It looks alright so far, though looks fairly well ish. In my opinion My personal opinion. The next step, we got this guy. And I think for this guy will be able to see him from the underneath. He's a little bit more above so will make his whole underneath a little bit darker. Just like this. Tailfin here would be fairly dark too. I feel like I have to make it uniform, though other. Select. Will just not let him like that entirely and then I'll race I'll push off? Or the light hits. Just like that. It's not too bad. I'll come back to this way later. But as it is now I'm not in a perspectives, too, wonky for me to actually do it correctly. So we'll come back to that kind. Uh I don't remember how this guys, I think that's his yeah that's probably his. Carly his. Facing us Finn. The thing that he has is facing the Camera. Where did my value go there, it is? Push that there. Get a little bit of that dip. Push that over. OK. Working Alright. I keep putting in a shadows where I think should be highlights. Instead, so let me try to do that a bit more. Like we're looking at the underside of this bigfin right, so that's going to be pretty dark on the bottom. That. Yeah. I can definitely put this in shadow. I know for sure that the light. Oh, that's what that was remember when I was having a hard time with this that's The Sun. It's just I wasn't used to seeing it as UM such an oblique. Is that the right word oblique? Ellipsi. That's why I was so weird. Just put that there get a little bit of shadows here. And start pushing that shape a little bit. There we go. Alright so now without the schedule here, we can see we've got a couple of like fairly. Whaley looking shapes. I'm going to do a uh well. Let's finish up. This guy this guy here will finish him up next and then I'll start adding in my. My highlights I suppose. I'd like to identify my son, though. Has anybody seen my son. Um. Yeah, let's do that. Let me just quickly draw in a somewhere so there's The Sun. Turn this on and I think I want to go ahead and start. Doing that. Will get the whales while we're at it like that. And I'll bring the sketch up a little bit. So the sun here is going to be quite bright as it typically is in most cases, the Suns fairly bright right. It's not just me. Let's just go ahead and block that guy in. Let's hide the whales for now, that way I can. Alter my son in peace. OK, so will lock the transparency for this and then just start bringing up the values make it real nice and brave. Turn that down. Select that. I want to have a little bit of atmosphere in the way so it's not going to be totale yellow. I want to be very rich very high saturation. Maybe not quite like that. That there. OK, so now will unlock that slowly push out these highlights. Maybe yeah, maybe just undo everything I just did. Doesn't look too bad? And I want to push some stuff in front of it. I just had him where they go. Here they are. What happened? What are my colors get somebody there we go? I'm trying my best here to make these look like. Look like these clouds are in front of the Sky in front of the sun here. They're going to get really blown out some spots. I want this to look nice and Overexposed in some places, but So it kind of tough kind of tough to do that for me at least. I need to do more studies. I think I should just go outside and stare at the Sky for a couple of hours every so often. And then paint what I see. I'm just getting a small tight brush. And then just noodle in a couple of white tights. Tight defined highlights. Something like that. Maybe not the worst idea like I have a couple of light streak but brushes. I wanna see how those how those look. It's not bad it's a bit weird. It's a bit dopey, but uhm. I don't know. I don't know. I don't like it. I think it is like stuck to an access those so let me. Is that a little bit just like that? It's a bit much. I think will add a new one on Top of everything too. Because when you get a nice light beam like that. It tends to. Well. It tends to bounce off the lens a bit. Which implies that we have a lens it's a bit weird? It's a bit of a weird zone of? Of. Thinking of the Camera as being present in your illustration to imagine a literal Camera. As opposed to just a scene you know it's a bit weird. It's a bit of a weird. Figured concept isn't it? Like a lens flare doesn't exist without a lens right. And when we see with our eyes it's RI that's the lens right. But I don't know already that's looking a lot more interesting. I think let's turn the sketch back on. And then go back to our whales. So now we can start to add in the. I think this is the brush I was using yeah, get to our whale now and this was going to be like almost totally dark because that's what happens when you get overexposure like that. Can you get a pretty harsh highlight and in fact? It's probably going to be darker than that? Almost probably almost black actually assuming that our Camera here doesn't have an HD RF like sensor on it, so. I don't think it does. A little bit more. Stuff. Little bit more value. One of the things that I tend to do consistently is not add enough. Enough contrast to my paintings. So I'm going to try to make the contrast a little bit higher here. So one thing that these whales are missing at the moment is well. We have 2 things majorly. There's the highlights and the volumetric scattering where the whales are going to get a little bit less contrast, Y and a little less saturated as we go further. Back in the scene. So I'll definitely wanna make sure to get some of that going. And then some texture as well would be nice for these whales whales are very leathery kind of kind of like leathery? What is that it's like that fatty leathery type of substance material that whales are covered in so it's got a lot of texture. Lots of variation in the bumps as well. So I'm going to try my best to get that looking nice and I might actually. Let's just out of Curiosity set this to multiply. That looks. Yeah, this might workout actually I'm going to paint my textures here so. Will get the values going? And this would probably be good to start as a value painting, but I'm already this deep, so I might as well. Just do it. Normally, I'm going to make a couple of like treads treks trendy trendy track areas in these whales make it look a little bit more. Open more depth to it, and I can follow my guidelines here really effectively to make sure that the. But the chunky parts follow the correct curvature of the whale. In perspective. That looks alright. And then we add the multiple ever Top it should correctly affect that. Wells also tend to be a little bit more white on the bottom right is that correct little bit more white on the bottom. So the actual like shadows and highlights don't matter here because it's being applied on a multiply layer above. So I can just get my correct colors in now. We can see, there that it's taken effect, maybe a little bit, too, dark to actually so I'll bring that up a little bit. Karen I did get alert for it, but I do see that now. Thank you for the follow pre, she ate you. Considering nobody said anything. I imagine that the audio is going right, it's all good to go. I can hear myself speaking on my other computer so I'm pretty sure that it's working correct. But I think it's good to ask good to make sure. Think I need to actually. And that's a little bit more. So I will get somebody to paint my clouds for Maine because I'm not very good at that I'll also get them to paint my Wales. For me because that's a lacking spot. 2 I think what I'll do this is my plan alright. This is what I'll do everything I can't draw. I'll pay someone else to do for me. How's that sound for an idea? So I'll get somebody to. Paint my sunbursts I'll get somebody to paint the little boat thing I've got going on. I'll just have like a bunch of other people do the whole thing for me. How's that sound it's not a bad idea? Let's get some textures going on here now. We use the I don't know if I wanna use ink brush or not. It's not quite what I had in mind, but maybe like this dry texture that's not too bad. But I do want to drop the flow a little bit, it's a little bit, too, sharp of a brush. Actually let's put this as a layer on Top of clipping layer as well. That way I can blur this without having too much problem. Too much for problem. This is not the one for me, but maybe this brush simply called texture one. Could be a little bit more up my alley not really that one either about this surface brush? I just want to get some, like spotty crusty texture to the whale. Help this brockriede breed. Not too bad. Um. Oh yeah that's kind of working out. Wider will get some darker's in there, too. No, it's not. No, not really that one either. It's a little bit tough isn't it? It's been tough to get a nice a nice brush. Especially for Specific things. As a I primarily do like more pen and ink, type illustrations and it's tough enough to find a brush like that. That's good, but Here we are now trying to get some good textures for a whale of all things. I think I already tried textured too. But maybe I should just concede just use one of 'em. So right. Looks alright enough. This will be OK. I don't wanna get you guys sick too. I'll make sure to cough away from the from the screen. So you guys don't get sick through it. You know. I don't think I've ever seen a whale. In person before. How do you do that? How do you go see a whale do you just like go out on the ocean in a boat or what? Yeah, I think so as well, and I think I'm going to on Top of the whale to make sure to add the Sunburst. I'm glad you like it baby? How's it going? Have you ever done a a spherical Panorama before? Florida is it it's pretty hot in Florida 'cause If it's hot in the Midwest here. I imagine it's probably like a good 7080 degrees at least right. He needs a little more curving cowbell. OK, but still six years. OK, well. That's not looking too, bad for the whale. Let's take a look at the shadow as well. Always always workout. Looks Alright looks fine enough. Not too bad. And all of my portraits I need to go back to this ad cow. Well so a lot of them. Yeah, OK. Let's add some of that to these other whales to then not too much, though. Not too much. Just enough to make him look a little neat. Will need I've got this layer locked it's a It's a clipping layer to the one below it, which makes it so that I can't paint outside of those lines just a little little reminder little tip for you guys if you're not aware of that. I've seen some people who aren't aware as well. Of the transparency, locking and all my God, the transparency lock is so helpful. I've seen people just use like selections to do that basically they would. Actually, this way isn't it. Like say for example, if I wanted to add a like a rim light to this whale as part of its base texture without doing a clipping layer. Some people will just like get the lasso tool out and they'll just carefully make this selection around the outside of it. I'm just in general, you tend to make your lower half of the space then in a handful of your portrait. You think so? I guess I just I'm worried about making people look fat. And then they'll just do that, and then make it that way. Probably probably is my cat. And like yeah, you know that it gets. The job done. I'm like anxious. But man just lock that transparency and Drop it in so much easier little tip. You think that's close here? Little. Tip from Ben just in case. You don't really know about it unless you think, to try it, you know, and it's such a. Some like that. Look down there like 51 so that we can add this area. Ambiguous little tool you know you think? What is log transparency mean a lot of people don't even know transparency is in the 1st place you know it's the things that you take for granted that other people don't know about so. 66 maybe. I think it's good to bring those up every so often. Just like controlling portraits is so intimate. Make people you know. People are very conscious of how they look and I don't want my. I take a lot of things for granted for sure. I just assumed that everyone else knows about it, you know. Nervousness to be. 80s wow, it some last I checked. Take like I don't know this multiplied by. It was around 55 degrees. I don't want my. Let me get an update. It's 50 right now. And it's going to be 64 tomorrow allegedly holy cow. Drawings to offend anyone, make them feel less attractive than they are because I'm learning how to draw people. And then in that same week it's going to be 39. 2020 boys. Well, I guess it's still 2019 isn't it. We can't quite believe it on 2020 yet. Just the way of the road. Go inspired, I wanna try my interpretation of that good looking dude. Yeah no I will post oh or do you mean you mean Rico from yesterday? Do you mean Mike right here or Rico from yesterday? It needs to be highlighted above his upper lip. We had a little bit of texture this guy. Oh yeah, because he has like this little streak of of highlight. Now these aren't meant to be highlights. These are meant to be textures. This is so helpful I cannot. Uh. I cannot explain like I cannot say that enough. I discussed it a little bit in my value painting streams, the difference being textures and. 'cause like you know I, it's nice if you call out 'cause then I can still see it and like learn and improve off of it. And. And. Material I guess and it's it's a very particular line and I'm not entirely sure myself. So I really do really appreciate it. Why is this alcohol multiplied? How that line is played out? Why is this happening? But there is a difference material being what something is made of and how it reacts to light whereas the texture is just sort of a? Really wish I would've taken on portraiture class at Micah. I guess the texture is kind of like a material on Top of your material. I would've gotten so frustrated though but probably also would have learned so much. I don't know I'll have to do more research into it. It's funny, too because it's like one of the core principles of art is like texture and. And uh what else would it be texture and value I guess. It's it's a really. Deep topic I think it goes, it goes down. The subject of that. Too much, isn't it? It was 69 nine. My stomach is growling at me, we've got about another. We're looking at about 40 minutes right now to do some more work on this and after that, I will indulge myself with some food. Definitely gone over, but I'm liking where this is going, so I'm not going to stop it. I don't know what our time is. And actually this will be my last stream of of. Not 2019 but the last stream of this week at least we've got Monday and Tuesday next week before the end of the year and I should try to come up with a good. Houses don't need to do that. Highlight on this area or don't I? Change. A good a good topic to rap us up for the year. Maybe do like a recap of things that I've personally learned although I don't really know if I can quantify that very well. I don't really know. There's nothing specific that I really did, although I did lots of Animations. In photo shop in October. So I might do a recap of stuff like that. Mostly, things, I guess that none of you have seen before because I'm fairly new to be hands now. Brightness Shadow and this area. And I don't have a lot of my own work, posted so really none of you guys know anything about me so maybe I should. Maybe I should spend my 2019 my last streams of 2019 to share a little bit about the work that I like to do both personally and I guess professionally. I don't do a lot of art professionally, but I'd like to for sure. But yeah, a lot of my work is done. Personally, I've been using my behalf streams. There's an opportunity to learn new things. Revisit some of the core concepts that I should have known by now like value painting for example, like what I've been doing. OK, that's looking good so far, uh let us just quickly. Save this whale Skype color? Yes. I'm going to select all of my layers here go to 3D Spherical, Panorama, an new from selected layers. I won't switch my workspace thanks. Now I can take a look at what we got of course, we don't have our. Our little vehicle here, but we can look around still and see wow OK that's uhm. That's going to need to be revisited a little bit there. Again, the very Top and very bottom of your photo sphere paintings will get a little bit crusty. And that's It looks like a scrambled egg doesn't or or a Sunnyside up egg. But everything else is looking alright for the most part, let's fit this to the screen, and then with the V key. We can select our move tool. It just kind of look around. I'll have to fix this will be done with the with the offset is well. Yeah, it's kind of cool to look around and see these whale buds hanging out. The values are a little bit. I don't even know if I turned on my multiply layer actually so we don't get to see the values of the shadow yet. But otherwise it's looking pretty needle. Just undo this again every time you pan your Camera while in the 3D mode, it will act as an action. Which is an undoable actions so I want to go back to here? And this should be our flat image. So we got some some awkward tearing because the background. It hasn't been tiled correctly. So we'll have to do that. Let's turn the sketch back on. And figure out why are Oh it's because what's happening is? The whole Top of this image is becoming the middle. So everything that's Everything that's up here. Is going to be kind of folded the imagine that you cut? This like a globe like you have a Globe wrapping an actual physical sphere. You've got to cut it in such a way that it flattens out correctly so. That's kind of the same concept here, I'm not very good at it. But I'll try my best to figure out why that looks so funky. Basically, like everything. Like in this area this margin is going to have a hard time and that might be easiest fixed. Inside the sphere so you can actually correctly project your colors were meant to go. But otherwise it's looking alright. Let's turn on our shadow layer. I think that would have made the whole thing look a little bit cooler. And let's hide Wales. We've got son, which is looking pretty crusty, but that's fine. Going to Combine these And then control, Alt F to redo my offset and here you can see that increase that we had, and that was a little bit of a problem, so I'm going to fix that now we've got a little over half an hour. Still, which I think should be enough time to at least get the foundation of our boat finished. Up. Is my watercolor brushes? It's always, in here. I always forget. And basically to solve that weird crease issue. I'm just going to. Make this not look weird. I think I want the clouds brush instead, though. Just make these 2. Line up a little bit more evenly. Fix this. This is exactly the same step. Do you think again? You would do if you wanted to make any sort of infinitely tiling or looping background whether it be for like. They can lighten up this whole. Here's this shadowy area. Tile Obel Pixel Art for a game or maybe you want to have a an animation and you want to have a background play forever. Also present here, but I can also. Bring down this highlight. Also bring up his shadow. You would use this same method. I think to do that. And this is super handy and super easy to learn. This area needs more work. That means more. Basically, all I've done here is. Shadow here. Once you identify. Intimacy. Your edges once you get your edges painted out what you can do then is offset it by half of your canvas size and that will give you basically the loop point that you want to connect and now that I've gotten that cleaned up I can just do the offset again. How's that? It says that. Like that. So you come on, he almost died. And now we have a perfectly infinite. The book I mentioned will give you homework in chapter. Oh, that's cool that will be called on to do on stream. Forever tiling. Background. Can you see the the. Homework each day and. So that doesn't apply just to these panoramic spheres that also applies to just really anything that has a perfect tile to it. This is. Totally different angle than. Bring the whales back to hide that horrific son back there looks like someone. Burn some pancakes or something like that. Or do I need to make his jaw wider? So where there we go there. You know what I mean? Um. Next up, I would like to add my highlights to these whales. Now that back up on the doctor now on doctors like my mom was a nurse so growing up whenever I got hurt I was like immediately, she's like you're fine, you're fine. OK so let's do that now. I'll have to fix my weird son tiling issue later on, though. You don't have to go there. You're fine. Um. Like I don't Mama everything you say so. Swepco new layer here. And I'll set this to lighten for now, I might change. Like doctors are way less likely to actually like. This up a bit as I go. And then let's just start painting in some nice highlights on these guys. Decide you need medical help until it's like time for you too. I don't know if I wanna use that brush that I might use my watercolor brush for that. In the hospital. It's a little bit harder of an edge. Slow down a little bit. Make a little bit smaller. There we go. This is missing some definition. I made changes to be like a light layer instead or a an overlay rather. Instead of this. Here like that. And I might end up blurring it too. This is just this nose. So it's not so sharp of an edge. It's too low. Well, thank you Leonardo how's it going man? Hi, I'm gonna quickly to the ears. I don't really care too much about yours. I feel like I should but. How is it going? And. Did you enjoy your Christmas if you celebrate Christmas? Did you enjoy your holiday weekend? Very rarely do people look at ears, and they're like that one like that here. It wasn't really a weekend, though I guess it's a weekend if it ends the week. It's just like that's just in here. Right you get off work and go home for that time I guess you could call it a weekend at that point still right. Unless they have something strange about their ear that they. Tell me to get some technical about it do it. Can easily identify. Grab this area. Now this is my so far, my 3rd. 3rd Little Spheric Panorama and I'm thinking it's coming along a lot nicer than the previous ones. I'm full of scars everywhere. Fire glass, conquer you name it I have all kinds of stupid accidents in my clinic history. Once I'm done with this. His jaw does need to be wider. Or whichever comes first be finishing this, or getting to the end of the stream. I'll show off the ones I did before now. I was working on the collection. For my actual. Behance page. I see his chin even needs to be wider. To show people, the Workflow and some of the reference files that are needed. As well as just the general progression. So I hate how I did that. I need to fix that. But I don't feel like I have enough. I don't know what is going to be even going to. Examples yet to build it and this should be a good piece to add to that, so I can actually publish it. But yeah, this is a surprisingly straightforward workflow as I've been discovering. Will this back down? I like that texture, it's such a nice texture. Kay. I think that the background is probably good enough for now, it's not ideal. There's still a lot of things I'd like to do. Oh, one thing I do want to do for sure. Though 'cause I'm going to add a new layer on Top of all the whales. And I'm going to set it to no, I want to actually make a? Will do a huge set layer 1st and I'm going to just go ahead and Desaturate. People need to learn when to go to the ER and went to go to urgent care. Every flood, the earth, little things. Some of this. Yeah, that's true. And I'm going to make it a little bit lighter, too. And then I'm going to take the mask that it has and fill it with I think. Right, right is so good he made him look healthier. He gained some quarantine extra pound man showed them. Black. And then what I'll do now is actually put this above the whales group and then attach it to the wells groups. This one. Now it's going to be using all of the information that the whales have and flattening it down. Don't know if that's any different than just putting it inside the group. Which I might actually just do instead but this will now be affecting only the whales so now I'm going to get a any brush. I suppose it doesn't matter right now and then using white going to be painting over the whales in the distance to make him look a little bit further away. And I might even push that a little bit more. Dropping the saturation and I'll probably do the same thing for a contrast layer and just reduce some of the contrast with those guys. And then when I'm totally done well, he's a Gray actually to get a not totale. Full on effect. I'm going to blur these guys a little bit 'cause, they're a little bit sharp. Excuse me. Sorry for that. Just using different levels of Greys I can add a little bit more depth to these guys. Just like that. OK and this is, after and before just make him look a little bit further in the distance you know. And Furthermore I think I'd like to add another layer on Top of that. Even now use isoft airbrush too. Get a little bit of reddish pinkish. Orangish in here. And then bringing this varisoft. Under light. Just like this across these guys, just varisoft. Like that. You might think yourself, then that looks a little bit extreme doesn't, it, it does look a bit extreme so let me set it to overlay instead. Maybe. Got a bunch of different blend modes here that might be. Well, the more appropriate. Will try just overlay for now, just see how it looks before and after a little bit of bounce light from the clouds. I'm hoping that will look fairly natural want to add a little bit of that to the whale here as well, just like just a little bit. Right around there. OK and also I want to add a another huset I think, to the whole thing just put that up here just bring up the saturation overall a little bit more. There we go that's too much. Cool, which is a couple of things to make it spice a little bit more. Spicy Wales. And I don't need to flatten these but I like to flatten things. It's like a weird instinctive just consolidating things and quickly squish him so that I can have him out of the way but I'm going to fight my urge and leave it alone. I like to see him consult that's why I like the group, so you can kind of do the same thing like that. Um. And I think on Layer 2, here I'm going to go ahead and like get this. Can I please select my brush? My keys are working. My short keys don't work. Thank you. White Bean. I put 1 right. Here. Maybe a little bit brighter than that. Carpet more. Are the flow is very low turn it up a little bit more? Is that a bit too much probably less back that up a little bit more? OK. I really like the effect uhm. Of showing like the area it's hard to say it's like the air itself is getting darker when there's a cast light so you'll end up seeing something a little bit like. Let's just try it. Let's grab, a good multiplied color, like this. And then I want to grab a softer brush. And then just adding a little bit of. It's a big process now. Like a bit lighter. OK, I'll just block these in a little bit more aggressively to start with. Will block him in a bit harder to start with and then I'll soften them up after. Like that looking a bit rough, so far, but I'll put these behind the whales. Actually, I should make it look a little bit better. You guys know what I'm talking about, though like that weird. Cast shadow I'm a huge fan of it. I think it looks really cool. Just put it like there. I'm sure you guys have seen what I'm talking about. I watched a movie called Ad Astra last night featuring Brad Pitt. It was never on my radar at any point in time. But I watched it was really cool. I liked it a lot. I love space movies that are done well. I wouldn't say that the movie itself is like. Crazy it wasn't like you know Space Odyssey Tear, but it's definitely neat and I notice that the same. Call shadow effect was present a lot of that movie. OK so that's looking pretty decent. Although obviously it's a little bit too. Sharp business So what I'm going to do is just blur. It nothing to nothing, too crazy, although I might do a radial blur. Let's try to radial blur for that. It's not previewing though. Yeah, it's completely invisible now. Let's try that again. Hum. Bring it down a lot. I don't know why you can't preview a radial blur, but you know. Just how it goes sometimes isn't it looks alright. It's looking all right now, it still may be a bit sharp, though. Let me let me just try once more. Or maybe blur gallery's got some better stuff for me here. No keep going with this. Go down to like 10 and then I can manually add a little bit of blur with asoft eraser brush. Specially, like on this line here. And. I want it to apply to the whale in the back. It's a little bit awkward. Right that way Liz. In the background, I'll just just push this back. It's lost a little bit of its weight. But I think I can fix that by actually. Changing the the colour so this is still a multiply layer so I just bring this down a little bit and then with the transparency locked. I can just fill that space. To make it a bit darker. There you go. This is maybe a bit much here. Bring that back a little bit. I think that's working I think that works out. For the sake of time, I'm not going to do this. But I think it wouldn't be a bad idea. To actually add some shadows of the whales on the clouds to that wouldn't be a bad idea but again, I'm just going to do it for the sake of time or I'm not going to do it for the sake of time instead. Let me bring this into the whales layer just to make it more obvious words meant to go. And I'm actually going to hide the whales now and make a new layer in the boat, which I think the boat would require a lot more time to look good. You know one thing that is nice, though. Let me flat and I'm going to duplicate the whales. Going to duplicate all those files merge them and then hide the ones below because what I've got is this issue of needing to offset my. My file a little bit every so often. Um. Like. Filter other offset. Like that I need to do that for the whales to an this the way it is now like this is the way it should be. Had a bit of an issue, there. And if I want to offset it normally would have for every single layer so I've got to come up with a way to make it not operate like that. And there is the slight problem here. I say slights pretty considerable problem of the blend modes. Acting differently. When merged so I'm going to hide everything. And I'm going to again I'm not going to duplicate it. But I am going to do a new empty layer and hold control. Alt shift and E and that will. Not quite not quite do what I want. What that does it flattens everything as it is visibly into one singular layer but even still didn't quite get the? Get the thing that I wanted out of that. Me. See if the background, you know, maybe it did work. Let me let me try that once more. And then undo all that. Turn the background on now you can still see that we've got this weird is weird effect being caused. So maybe I'll just have to. I have an idea of how to deal with that I can just continue to work. As if it's not a problem and then at the very end. I can just flatten everything visually. So this is probably going to be OK. I suppose, but kind of sketch back on. I want to take my background. And then To know the background is fine as it is not going to happen to the boat and will just get this going now. So I want to get some good colors for this guy. I'm not really sure I've been thinking of like a weird sort of military green color. For this, but I don't really know if I want to actually go with that. Hum. Michael with like a nice imagining a speedboat now in some ways that I kind of think that eh. Like a white, red and black combo might not might not be a bad idea. But something about blue would be a good compliment to the Sky. So I might go with like a bit of a bluish whitish look. Let's give that a try. Is that? OK. Let me just make a nice. Knockout layer for the boat here. Hey, you know what let me actually redo the line art for this guy to. I'm going to at some point in the future anyway. So I might as well do it now, just tighten up the line art make a little bit more. Queen. And I've got just the tool for this so with the 2020 addition at least it might have been even more later than that, but they've introduced the symmetry tool. And it's really handy up to this point what I've been doing is drawing half of my illustration and then duplicating it and flipping it for good symmetry, but that's annoying to do so. Luckily, now we have this beautiful symmetry tool. Which I think will be greatly useful and I'm just going to draw the boat again like this and I might even. I don't want to move my sketch, but I might. 'Cause as it is right now, the steering wheel isn't quite lined up and I don't know if I want to move the. Turn off Phone with a sketch or my symmetry plane. I don't know if there would be any downsides just moving the sketch, but it might throw up the whole thing and I don't want to do that. Alright let's just move. OK. I want the string would look nice. I don't know if I can execute like a good a good looking steering wheel. Free hand. It's alright it's OK. I'm going to go ahead and like. Draw these little like I don't know spokey bits, but I'm going to rotate it later. Not gonna worry. I like to say this. I like to say. I'm not going to worry too much about the line art even though I am an even though I would like it to look good, I still just say like Oh yeah, we don't worry about it, too much. It's it's fine. While inwardly I'm saying I'm doing the best I can. Please. Please have mercy on me. Please please don't make fun of my lousy line, art for those. If you're not terribly good at doing the symmetry tool you can get some stuff that looks a little bit weird. So the tried not to do that, if I can help with. We've still got our base grid over Top of all this. Which makes it really easy to fix my perspective issues so I've got this line going like this? But it really should go like this. In between these 2 lines here here. That's a handy little cleanup. That I can do. The same thing here as well, just follow those lines the lines the guidelines will not. Will not abandoned you will always be there and helping out? We've got these lines here as well that we can use to match the curvature. That. And This is why I wanted to redo the line art for all of this because. The old stuff was a little bit rushed a little bit weird, not really ideal so will just fix it. We want to follow these lines now to match for the door. So we've got. I think this one here. It's a little bit weird as we approach the horizon line. They get a bit of a mess of perspective grid. So I'm going to try to make it look a little bit cleaner. We've got about 15 minutes left. I'm going to do about 10 minutes and then I'm going to show off some of the older stuff that we did up to this point and I'd like to go and look at some other artists on the hands and really give some appreciation out to those people too. I don't know if anybody else is live right now. I can take a peek and I can redirect you guys over to them. I've seen lots of people trying out the new fresco app. I think it's only on the I think it's only an iPad actually fresco it might be available on. Like Android, but I'm not entirely sure. I'd love to get an Android tablet and use as a portable like sketching tool. But I don't have. Anything like that at the moment. And I don't really want to draw on my Phone. I've tried it before I downloaded the photo shop app on my Phone. And my Phone is just it's a large Phone, but it's still just a little bit too. Too small for that kind of thing. Just cramps my hand a lot. And it's not very comfortable. But I know a lot of people who work exclusively on like an iPad or something like that. And that seems like a really cool handy tool to have. My cough is been getting better, but it's still there. Still, very annoying. I don't know I think it costs like that, although I can't really remember last winter very well. Nothing really stands out about it, I don't remember if I got sick or not during that time. I feel like my immune system is been getting worse as I get older, too, which is you know like how things work but. It's becoming a bit alarming actually a little bit little bit alarming. All right. We've for the most part. Got that sorted out. OK let me turn off my symmetry tool now. I wanted to get mostly just the foundation of the boat done with that. I want this to look like a helmet of some sort but I'm not very creative when it comes to stuff like this. So just drop in. Oh jeez just dropping some shapes that look kinda cool. I want to look like a kind of cool helmet, but not like uncharacteristic of the environment. That makes sense. Like I feel like having these weird like? Air filtration bits, they make sense, but they look a little bit spooky, you know, kind of spooky look to it. Kind of sinister almost. Um Lenardo, thank you for the following work. Omneya. And Bree as well. Thank you guys all for the follows appreciate you greatly. I'd like to get A at least like some base colors in for this ship this boat. Before I in the stream so I might do some compromises on the line art just to get that sorted out. I've got about 10 minutes left so I want to get this done reasonably fast. OK, that looks fun enough. I'd like to add some nice nice line art, though, and I don't really feel like I get the chance. Gotta couple like knobs and dials and switches and levers. And hope that it looks good in perspective. I don't know if it will or not, but. It's alright. I'd like a little like lever here. I don't want to compromise, the whole piece just for the sake of drawing in some stuff, so let me clean it up a little bit there, we go. I want to rotate the steering wheel as well so it doesn't look so. So. Symmetrical like that. Adding like some nice. Implications of reflection. That I want to add some more blocked in Shadows, too because locked in shadows are really good for adding like an artificial sense depth. So will do some of that might even like draw a slight outline around those boots there. It's like that an instead of doing a full. Black I want some cross hatching too. Just for some visual interest, I guess. And then I also want to block that out there. And then on the opposite side will do the same thing just like that. OK looking good looking good so far, so we've got a pretty tight. Sketch now bring out. I don't want to sound panicked. I'm not panicking. I'm just I'm just in a little bit of a rush to get this looking alright. Just like that, the faster I talked the more stressed out. I imagine it makes his feel. Like a small? Couple of like containers here, maybe even add like a couple of panels up there just for some for some visual interest. You know like a little bit cooler and now I'm going to do a layer below this and I'm going to just start blocking in so my blue or values, so turn sample all layers on and then turn my tolerance up a little bit more just start filling these areas and then I'll tighten it up later. Not really sure if I like that particular blue, though, so let me just grab all that. Darker how we feeling. A little bit more like metal. Not bad? OK, I imagine like a bit of a darker seat. I imagined a green for awhile there play on that idea. We're still back a little bit. I'm gonna get maybe like some white for the consoles up here. Maybe not a bad idea. White and black. Aren't the bad combo? Some fairly dark boots, I don't know if I wanna go for like this blue or not. Blueish grey that's fine. Like that. And this helmet, I think I want to make it like a little bit more in the white area and give it may be a? I don't know how 'bout just like a nice kind of chill blue for like this rim edge. Then maybe like a bit of a black good for this filter here. Sure. And this is a little bit dumb considering my timer strains, but I'm going to do this make it. At the face visor here grab all the Sky and reflect it back. I hope that's the implication that it's reflecting all that even put like isoft highlight along the side here, too. Just like that. That's not too bad I get a nice dark console here. I'll make the steering wheel, Red House that's sad because, like a red steering wheel. Yeah, not like this just like a silver just a quick. Quicksilver, like that a couple of darker bits across there may be having like a nice bright red lever there. And then I gotta do the sides of here still. Get all that looking good to East doors up. The good news is we've had 0 crashes. I'm pretty sure the audio is working. Alright well, yeah, I guess breeded reply to what I said, so yeah, audio is working. We've got no crashes made a lot of progress. Today, feeling very good about the whole thing. I was hesitant to set up my other PC for the streaming purposes. But it's turning out to be a really good decision. And while it does involve a little bit of extra legwork. It ends up being worth it in the end for sure. Um. Do I want to just call it there and will just. Just take a little people, but we got. I think so. It's not like I'm. Legally obligated to never go above my 2 hour period so. Probably just Finish this up a little bit. And. And then what will do what I want to do in just a second. I wanna make this like a darker. Start. I'll go ahead and make that. Although I wanted to look like like this kind of metal actually. Or maybe the string with metal like that. Alright not too bad there. Um, I'll just leave the little dividers for the door. The way they are that's probably OK. And. You know what let's just do a quick a quick multiply layer for the shadow here just like that. Like this. There we go. I've got a good feeling about this one spring. The whales back in there, a little in the way aren't they will fix that. OK. Since I did the shadows might as well. Do the highlights as well. It's a never ending cycle of addition and Subtraction and trying to make things look better try to make him look less bad. It's a forever game that we play. There's going to be a bit of an obvious seem I think when it comes to this chair, but it shouldn't be too big a deal. Um. Kay. So let's just merge all these together. After duplicating actually let's duplicate him emerge am will hide all these and. What I'm going to do is actually flip it and I might as well fix it? I can it's right there. No big deal perfect. There fixed. Although. Just do that easy solved. So the whales are like that, too, and the whole background is as well. So it's better to make this layer. A little weird instead. I think what I'd like to do is. Let's apply a look up table. A color look up. And see if we can get a nice. Nice look. Are they all here? Yeah, it looks pretty nice OK. Um. I think the whole thing is backwards. So I'm going to make a new layer here and then put everything into that layer and then flip it whoops. I applied my blur by accident, were going to invert it offset it that's right. There we go. And we're going to have a weird looking son, but I think that's probably OK. The whales are in the way let me crop. Hello. Oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. I've jumped the gun. OK. This layer needs to be set to like overlay. OK. Now we can copy this and flatten it. So now we have our boat. OK. I'll put that up here. Next up? We want to get the whales in the background, So what I think I'll do here is actually. Yeah, well combine the whales an will combine the background into this layer. So now we have our two elements here we've got our boat. And we've got our whales in background here. So the first thing we need to do is. Make our whales correct. The boats in front where it should be. And now we can combine these guys together. And. That's a bit annoying I'm sure that's fine, though actually let me just. Step back a little bit. That's not working. How to airbrush? Smooth that out, a little bit. They all play a no that's not going to work here. It's going to play my noise blur filter, but that's not really what I want for this so now we have both of our elements put together as they should be. and I will do a let's just do a huge set kind of bus things up a little bit. Make a little bit more visually interesting. A little bit darker in some spots little bit brighter there. Just do some just do some color correction. Bring up a little bit of the contrast a bit is that a bit too much maybe a bit too much there. And then over all of this, I want to have a color look up. And I will choose something looks nice to strip does not work. None of these are working actually very well. Only combine all these together. I don't think any of these are going to be what I want. That was not too bad and it's a little bit overexposed, though, isn't it. Um. You can't really just grab a color. Look up table and expected to work, though a lot of times so this one looks OK. I'll go with it. I'll flatten these again and do window about 3D Spherical, Panorama, an new from selected layers and this will be our finished product for today. At least I think it's a work. Alright isn't it properties. Where is it? OK, you know what you win going back to the 3D view. There we go. Will drop the field of view down to like? 3 three is probably fine. 2 is OK as well. I suppose and will hide our windows and go into full screen and then fit to screen and there, you have it fellas. This is our little boats. A little a little crusty here and there, but overall, it's not too bad. Obviously, it needs. Some fixes and I will learn overtime. What doesn't doesn't work for things like this, but I think it's pretty cool. I think it's not too bad for the most part. The. The lens flares. Not really the best are they good. We got a nice high res. Panorama painting here. Obviously spending some more time on the composition. I could be cool. If you could see the distance, a little bit more. The whales need some work. There's lots of issues here and there, but overall, I think it's kinda nice thing you can grab this guy downloaded as a PNG pop this into your VR tool of your choice on your Phone or your PC for example, you can open this up as a 360 image in virtual desktop and you can actually view it in real time I did that before I don't want to do it now 'cause it takes a little bit of setting up. But yeah, I think it's I think it's working alright. But yeah, I think it's I think it's working alright. Look and you see how skewed the helmet was initially it looks a little bit better.

So in that stands out a bit more from the rest of this, yeah. Hell yeah before I want like a second area to match this as well. But before that I might just place. A little bit of silver here. To make that whole thing popping up. Oh hey, Grut Yeah man, this is a good place to talk if you want. I've been on so I don't know if you can. He been on while I've been off, but. Yeah, if you have any questions about. The op journey and all that ask it here. I'd be really happy to talk about it here. But yeah, seeing some of your past work would be really helpful for the questions you were asking. I think. What is it like 3 days ago? OK, yes I wanted this to be a bit brighter, normal italic. OK yeah, the cloth here should make that Green as well, let's see. And what are you up to, Lee? How's that rap coming along? I can hear his New Zealand accent. Wait, wait, I said it was you. Should that be green? Should I make that green? Was a weird. Should this be white? Going into desaturate. It just white for that. Think that feels better. But I will make the top one little bit funky color. Let's up the. Up all these maybe not brightness. And four Jesus is pretty funky. Who? Now, is this reduce our should huge jitter? Yeah, here we go. Stay in the same Hue. Hacks bro. Like that? If you guys wondering what I use there, it's. Brush settings going to color dynamics tennis on. And post the Hue saturation and brightness jitter. If you understand what these means and you basically understand what this does, if I turn that huge it away up, we're going to see a bunch of different colors pop up. See, but if you want to really know what colors that we want this to be, then keep that Hugh relatively low. And you should be good. I like to use it with a brick type of brush. Everyone's doing a rap bro. Until I call you bro, I never say bro. Stuff I mostly worry about is what to practice first, not withdrawing people or characters in general. I think I mentioned that I want to illustrate my stories eventually. OK, yeah, I think like Oh yeah I remember now. Yeah so it sounded like you act like the very early beginning stages of art and. To be honest, anything that you draw is really going to help you for this is my opinion. It's just you get so much mileage out of just drawing, so you know copying artwork that you like right now and understanding how that like what they do is already going to be very beneficial for you and also you have to copy things. That's one way of doing things. You could also. Practice doing your versions of some current existing art as well. So. What I mean by that is like it's basically using reference, so you have your reference and you change up some stuff to make it noticeably different, but you heavily rely on that reference to help you create that outlook. Studies yesterday useful. I think the issue with that is that's slowing down the mileage that I'm talking about. At least I find out for me like that's not something that everyone deals with, but study is is pretty boring and he is an I think this starting stages of art should be very fun. Because, you know, it's a brand new skill that you're learning. You should be interesting in just trying it. And like you know, drawing different styles and copying those different styles. And even if you draw bad, it's OK because you just started so. Yeah, if you focus on that mileage then you should be all good. So basically to ask your question, what should you practice? When you want to draw people and characters is to draw people in characters, copy them for now and then, yeah, that's what I would do. You know there's all the other resources that are free right now. Like drop box. A bunch of YouTube videos you can watch how people will go through the process of that. But yeah, there's a few things you want to think about as well while you copy. And while you learn and. You just want to notice like certain proportions and all that like. There's a lot of resources out there talking about like how many, how to measure proportions in a character, for example. So you can use like the head as your measurement tool, and the body can be split into different numbers of heads with width and the height. So once you learn things like that, you'll be aware of it when you start copying other artwork, you'll think of it as well. And then eventually, once you've drawn enough, once you've copied enough, you'll start to. Remember. What it's like to draw characters in certain proportions so you don't have to rely heavily on that reference. Now, by the way, like when I say copy doesn't mean you copy it and then like you posted online over saying that you did it yourself, that's definitely not what you want to do. You just copy it for your own sake. You're drawing for your own sake. You don't have to like post it anywhere. Low commitment. Just just there for you. You know self learning. Guidance as good as it is I think you know paying for it at the moment, I don't think it's too necessary because this is so many free resources right now. So yeah, and all those videos is resources can help you give you ideas what you should do. For mileage. Yeah, like even if you if you like what I'm drawing, you just want to copy the head or something easy. Copy it, you'll see like how I simplify certain things, certain features and things. Honest, complicated as it looks when you break it down to each tiny section. There's a lot of times you can, you know. Start to learn. As well, they always ask questions. In discord, the cycle path says. OK, we've got our flats down now. We can start to add some shadow. Oh yeah, one more thing. You should probably learn if you want to do digital art in particular is get get to understand what we talk about in. The tool by using photo shop, so understand what it means. When I open like new layers, clipping masks. Yeah, I think I'll just list some essential things that you should probably learn about so there's layers clipping mask up, masking. In general adjustment layers, and the different options you can pick in here. I mostly use Hue, saturation, color, balance levels, curves, an gradient Maps, or yeah, gradients brush brush settings. I think all these are pretty important. And you'll selection types will be useful. Keep it simple at slot yet, so I think all you really need is. Your brush and your layers I think. Those are the main things you should probably learn about. You don't have to go crazy. You have to get like a crazy brush like I don't know whatever this one is, you don't. You don't need that, just your simple round brush does a lot, but make sure you understand things in your brush settings. 'cause that's pretty important. You definitely want to have at least transfer on with pen pressure. And yet hit me up with any questions during the stream. If you have any pop up ads, you try some stuff. I'll be happy to help. But yeah, that's from colors down, huh? Other colors, let's get some lighting down. This is where things start to go. Pop pop man. This is multiply. And. Will go cool shadows. And if anyone else has questions about art stuff. So let me know. Hit me up. This is definitely what I'm doing now for these fish. My practice to digital, and I'm currently on iPad drawing on Glass kind of throws me off, so I figure I should get over that quickly with this. Hell yeah, that's the right way to think. Understand what medium you want to work with early and practice that. I don't think that I don't know. There's a lot of mixed information on this, but I'm you know, I'm very certain, for me at least, that understanding my medium helped me greatly and I don't even really work in digital at all, so I don't touch digital. And that hasn't affected me in anyway, but. Well, I say that after I've had like a lot of experience with traditional as a kid, so maybe there are some advantages to early learning with your traditional medium. Maybe it's faster, maybe it builds confidence, so if you, if you find tutorials that say you should probably do this in traditional. Then maybe you should do it in traditional, like I think there are some exercises in drop box that's about building confidence and and steady line work and those might be pretty essential to do in traditional. But yeah, getting used to getting used to drawing on the iPad isn't a bad thing and iPads a great tool for art. I think it might be a bit slower for me, but it's definitely doable if I want to make it like. You know my work working. Medium Hard rough so faithful hard round buddy. That's the brush you need. I've also used creator on and off for a bit. Yeah and release myself but. I thought of it and let people use it. All right guys, let's take a poll. Very important question. Ultimate question. Yet this is like a dual die. I you. Around brush person. Or square brush person. Shout it out in chat. No judgment here, but ultimate question. And I'm just saying if your if your square brush then yeah we don't appreciate your kind. Square. Square round all. You converted me to the Round. Hell Yeah round is so good. Round AF they almost make it was maybe say the F word. So close I say. This is a very PG stream alright, I'm very controlled. No swearing. Just put my shadow color here so I can. Pick on this when I need it. Here's what I think of people who use round brushes like hell. Yes, like you understand what you're doing. Good control. You can pick up your textures and all that from the round brush. Awesome. Square rush now. It's like, in my opinion, is like. Is pretentious trying to be like a traditional painter and you lose control and your old wacky. That's what I think of round square rush uses. Wacky people meant just kidding. But yeah, I just prefer round. I just feel like the controls so much better. Like you don't have a weird long or short edge. It's never weird corner to work with if you want to get like a nice. Tight. Troll on the brush, just turn it smaller. Yeah, you get that nice control. Square brush. Now. I judge. I said I do like to whip out the square brush every now and then. Would even brush always use always use round brush? I can't look around this brushes. Man, I could put this. I could put this brush on a football field and people would know what to do with this. That's how around this is Alright. I could like throw it in a possible caught in there like hell yeah, slam dunk that. Here's the thing people do with lighting that I would talk about real quick as well. Something I've noticed a lot. See, I'm like Falvey covering up certain areas with shadow. I think people don't control their lighting well enough like this. I think if it was done by. Um? Some newbie artists they would like. Add shadows across. The edge is only. And then everything ends up looking flat. Something like this like they see every component. And they saw satellite it like this edge edge edge edge. Because the lights coming from the top right, top, left right so I gotta Add all these edge shadows. But then there are whole forms that like will not be facing the light source. Areas like in here it's just being covered by this whole edge here, so if you want things to feel more 3D, you have to understand. You'll forms an your lighting an some big booty like bold moves like this is necessary. Don't just shadow along the edges like this, that's bad. And the way to understand how to get to this stage is too. You know, create a sphere might be useful. I'll do it now even. Is it so quick? So I'll do a sphere that's in the same light source as. As a as a man. I'll dude. Wait, what we're doing? And you notice like to make this feel spherical, there's going to be a lot of. Area that's covered in shadow. So that's going to be same as algi, right light from the top left shadow on this side. This whole areas of discover his shadow. So if you think about this in a 3D form. Let's relate it to like this shoulder armor. I want it to be round right the way I've drawn it. So if it is round, there's going to be areas that are heavily covered in shadow an we have to determine if it's which edge on the sphere is corresponding to. The plane of the object where trying to light and if that areas in shadow then that means we should be. Putting all that in Shadow, and in this case I think I should have a little bit more, so I'm just going to push that across a little bit with the gradient. And yet, like see how this is like. I'm imagining this has like curvature on this, right? It's like this round, so if it comes around like this will be similar to like this area of a sphere so. This should all be Leslie Shadow. I'm going to use a hot air brush do this. I'm just going to. Get back to softening. Some of the shadows later. This is the same layer. do I have the right color picked? I do?N't. OK. Yeah, so this will help us think about forms a lot better. Keep that in mind. Yeah, so again, no edge shadows. Thinking big chunks. And use that sphere. I love you 3000 thanks Ann Lamb. Pichu, I love how you explain things. I love explaining things as well. 'cause I I'll bring classes right? So I run I see like issues that people run into pretty often and you know, I don't want to like people posted in discord. and I notice issues. I don't want to like. Point them out if they ask for critiques. But these common type of issues, I think it's good about. It's good to talk about in here. And if you run into any type of issues that you want to resolve, just let me know. I'm really happy to talk about it here. I'd love to help. And just because we're going into shadow in certain areas, like in here doesn't mean we have to stay in their right. Maybe some of the edges on here pop out far enough to receive some light, for example this edge. It's facing upwards according to our sphere. Things that are facing upwards can receive light. So if that's facing up enough and it is protruding outwards enough, then we can get some light hitting here. See that. So just that little change can do quite a lot. We've we're telling, telling people that this little object pops out a little bit. We've we're telling, telling people that this little object pops out a little bit. That is, changing the angle of the form. That is, changing the angle of the form. That's what is very important about lighting. That's what is very important about lighting. The moth of constructive criticism. The moth of constructive criticism. Wow, that's that's kind of cool. Wow, that's that's kind of cool. And yet, the more accurately you set yourself up in this stage, the better. And yet, the more accurately you set yourself up in this stage, the better. I think you don't want to like brush past this stage too quickly in. I think you don't want to like brush past this stage too quickly in. Jump into quick rendering. Jump into quick rendering. If you take a time here, then that quick rendering later will be much much easier. If you take a time here, then that quick rendering later will be much much easier. Pop up with my explanations. Pop up with my explanations. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Yeah, I love doing the render stage like for me it's like. Yeah, I love doing the render stage like for me it's like. There's not too much thinking after. There's not too much thinking after. Do anyone, sort of? Do anyone, sort of? Second nature. Second nature. And there's also so much to talk about because it's bringing in a lot of fundamentals together when you get to this stage. And there's also so much to talk about because it's bringing in a lot of fundamentals together when you get to this stage. When I was doing the line work before windows, like just at this stage here it looks cool, but there really isn't much to talk about. When I was doing the line work before windows, like just at this stage here it looks cool, but there really isn't much to talk about. An yeah, I think maybe I'll just go through the other characters and through the line work. An yeah, I think maybe I'll just go through the other characters and through the line work. Separately outside of stream and then come back to you like rendering. Separately outside of stream and then come back to you like rendering. For the stream. For the stream. So we have more to talk about. So we have more to talk about. Yeah, love rendering. Yeah, love rendering. Before when I was just learning, I remember I struggled a lot with rendering and I would. Before when I was just learning, I remember I struggled a lot with rendering and I would. Have to think a lot about it and it was less fun like I'd be rushing to finish my artwork. Have to think a lot about it and it was less fun like I'd be rushing to finish my artwork. But these days, when I'm understanding there's so much more depth to it. But these days, when I'm understanding there's so much more depth to it. So much information you have to add. So much information you have to add. And I have to think less about things that had trouble with before. And I have to think less about things that had trouble with before. I can enjoy it to the fullest. I can enjoy it to the fullest. Take my time. Take my time. At detail. At detail. One more thing I didn't mention about this fear is that sometimes you have to imagine there's two spheres here. One more thing I didn't mention about this fear is that sometimes you have to imagine there's two spheres here. Like imagine there's one more sphere on the right of this. Like imagine there's one more sphere on the right of this. And if there's light coming down from the left side, then this fear will be costing Shadow on the sphere on the right. And if there's light coming down from the left side, then this fear will be costing Shadow on the sphere on the right. So this is the case here. So this is the case here. We have like a big shoulder armor here that's costing shadow onto this neck area and will most likely cast shadow onto part of. We have like a big shoulder armor here that's costing shadow onto this neck area and will most likely cast shadow onto part of. This headpiece Probably come all the way around here to be honest, that car shadow. This headpiece Probably come all the way around here to be honest, that car shadow. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. How long you been drawing this ohm? How long you been drawing this ohm? So I've been going through, let me find some files real quick. So I've been going through, let me find some files real quick. So here are the sketches of all the characters I think I spent around. So here are the sketches of all the characters I think I spent around. Three sessions getting. Three sessions getting. I took like 2 so yeah, each stream is like 2 hours. I took like 2 so yeah, each stream is like 2 hours. I could get 2 characters done per stream, 2 characters, sketches done per stream. I could get 2 characters done per stream, 2 characters, sketches done per stream. So I'd say one hour this is. So I'd say one hour this is. Probably like the. Probably like the. 2 hour Mark. 2 hour Mark. I think right now. I think right now. When you want to work with lines, I think you get a lot of accuracy, but it can slow you down as well. When you want to work with lines, I think you get a lot of accuracy, but it can slow you down as well. It's a little fun community. We can share your outlook. Get to know some other artists from around the world. We do challenges as well. In fact, about finishing up one of our challenges where we're doing a telephone game. And I can show you that's what we did before actually so my local files, so that's easy to access. But I can't click my. OK, I think my windows is dead. I thought it can click like my folder thing. Now here we go back. Let me grab that. Stuff. Mikes dropping? Up here we go challenge. Here we go. So. Last time you did the telephone game, basically what the telephone game game is we have. Someone who passes an artwork. Two and it goes in like sort of a chain right? So it started off with me. I had full groups of people that did that did this. This is the outlook that it started off with. And basically you pass it down to the next person. So example case parts for my art and did her version of the piece I did and then she passes on her artwork to the next person. And then that person only sees case be arts work and doesn't see mine. And does her interpretation of case, vearth, artwork and so on. So you end up with a variation of like an evolution of original artwork. I mean like you come back and look at the end and see how it changed rap. Very close to the reveal stage for the current challenge which is very exciting. So yeah, it's very fun. Last time this is the kind of stuff we do on on my discord. For anyone interested. I have a link in this stream description, I think. Yeah it's down there. Moscow, California hell yeah. I don't have anyone who's rushing in the discord, actually. I can't recall. Maybe there are and they're not active. For now I'm curious about my time zone. I'm in Sydney, 7:45 AM up nice and early for the stream. Main reason I'm up so early is 'cause I have better Internet during this time so. Otherwise, I probably stream at like lunchtime. If I could I would be ideal for me. OK, I'm going to do like a. 'cause this side of the shield is sort of around here on this fear, and that area is a bit ambiguous. It's like between light and shadow is kind of Softap. So. I'm just going to add like a slight gradient on here, same as like the leg and foot here. And we pretty much very close to finishing off the lighting on this guy. Our initial lighting. Just a few more spots to keep consistent like this thing. Telegram is more popular. What's telegram? Tell me about it. Get some more juicy information of sharing a second after I. Finish up just a few more small areas of shadow. I think this would get some cost shadow from this shoulder pad eventually. Yeah, there we go. Alrighty, let's talk about edges, huh? Hard edges verse, soft edges. When should you transition from? When should like lighting transition and become soft edges instead of hard edges? I think. Like that should cover up. This is very important because this is telling us what is a car shadow, what is form Shadow and understanding. The difference is very useful in representing. Clear forms in your characters or whatever you're drawing. Actually, that's not bad. Actually offers people a few more spots too. To come rub. I missed the hand completely. And then I'll come back to that talk about hard versus soft edges. OK, so as I was saying. Oh yeah, what about will just go ahead? Hard versus soft edges. When should you use them? So let's use. This is the leg as an example. I think we have a great example around here. This like. We have a cloth that's costing Shadow on this leg. And we have areas of form right? The legs around. So. How do we represent that? This is a cast Shadow and this isn't a cast shadow. This is just a form that's turning away from the light source. So that's what the whenever. Something like that. You should definitely use a softap brush notice off brush off brush will work or smudging, and you only have like a blended edge. And this is the difference right when it's a blended edge that's telling us that this is a form that's turning away from Light, 'cause That's a slow transition. That's why I said nice zsoft edge on that. We can leave this as a hard edge because. There's no transition like that for car shadowcon shadow suggest areas that are blocked by another object. Blocking light. From having their light blocked by another object, so that's why it stays a hard edge so. And she turned your. If you turn your car shadows into soft edge. It doesn't really make sense, and then everything will look very blurry and. A bit ambiguous, so definitely keep those edges hard and I'm just going through a lot of edges in here and determining whether their soft and hard edges according to. Then being cast shadow or form shadow. He's a big form shadow here. Cloth is a good one for hard and soft edges. 'cause it's only transitions in there. And you'll see that this will look quite different after I do this merging. Hell yeah OK we're getting there. And we could sort of still edit out light eye shadow color, which is really fun. Like a little bit more purple instead of blue 'cause I didn't want to make it slightly warmer. Think blue is a bit too cool. And we can always turn down the Opacity as well, so it's not so aggressive. I think I started off with a darker, darker value so I can build up from here. That was my initial plan. Grab that shadow color. Apply it to more areas, whoops, wrong mode. OK, one more area needed to change. Colours I think we need to sort of represent that this is a soft material here, so I just make that. Which I do. I think I should. Probably keep this upper arm light and turn these things. Dog. Alright, another ultimate question for you guys. Do you prefer painted artwork that painted Ross? Painterly look Or do you like line art? No judgment, but definitely adored. I question. That's better. Right, let's add some lighting as well. I prefer a rough painted stuff, I think, but it's painted wrong comparison. I love both bathrooms painted ones. Also put in a paint. Yeah, there's something feeling about the Painted Looker. And for anyone wondering what I'm doing right now, I'm using a colored Dodge mode. I've turned off some options in here, so these used to be ticked. I turn those off for my color Dodge and I'm just going with some lighting and defining some of these. Materials. So materials You could, like you know, slap on a texture. That's photo, but I really don't think she do that thing. Materials are represented by different value ranges. So that's what I'm doing right now, and everything that sort of. Using the same range of values, right? I had the flats and then I add a shadow on top, but we start introduce a different range for value range for certain material. You start to understand that it has different information from. Some of the other materials. And that's what's happening here. Very easy clap. The transition area, so I'm just going to pick. That a warmth. And that overlay. In some of these transition areas. That's going from light to shadow. I think that was a bit too red orangey. See how this looks. Yeah, might be better. I'm going to pick on those areas that a bit softer edged. Here. Can I have it? The more blood on this guys tones as well. That's something else does pretty well. OK, and I might also. Where is it? Or looks kinda cool when it's like. Doc metal Actually I do. I do wonder now. What happens if I like huge shift a little bit and look through? It's kind of cool. My dear is that. Will have similar materials by different color for each of these Warriors, so we definitely will run into some that have like detailing like this guy, but then it has like different color detailing instead. Green's kind of cool though. But we'll go with yellow. Was it I want to select these things and add lighting on that as well? A less aggressive light, maybe something. With lower opacity. I'll feel. Nice. And since I did everything like separate laid like this is so easy to select stuff right? Like if I wanted to select those markings again, you know I just hold CTRL, Press the layer and get all the selection for that if I want like the light toned arma I can select that. Phone select the Brown bits. Then I thought of here the whole silhouette and start he raising areas that I don't want selections off with arm by holding alt. And control. So now I can easily affect all the Brown areas. That's the power of setting things up nice and clean and right now that's relevant because I want to add a second very light. And secondary lights only appear in shadowed areas. So what that means is I can select my shadowed areas now. And adding a softap. The flight maybe with like a blue. Getting that secondary light. Easy see now just affecting. Wait, not that do work, I didn't. Using the selection. There we go. Now I can just affect all the areas of shadow. With my secondary light and secondary lighter mainly thinking about it coming from the top down. So any services that are facing upwards. And apply that. And this is how we show some more format information in those shadowed areas.", "duration": 1592.4100000000071, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url": "https://www.behance.net/videos/fb8f38dd-e555-491a-97c2-de1a2185fa60/Concept-Art-with-Jeffchendesigns", "intents": {"using": [[87, 90], [111, 116], [175, 179], [276, 279], [281, 287], [359, 362], [397, 399], [417, 425], [448, 455], [500, 507], [524, 526], [598, 601], [629, 631], [633, 636], [666, 668], [677, 680], [756, 762], [778, 782], [788, 791], [827, 829], [855, 859], [980, 986], [1004, 1008], [1064, 1067], [1089, 1091], [1107, 1109], [1128, 1137], [1275, 1282], [1296, 1300], [1320, 1323], [1331, 1333], [1339, 1341], [1346, 1350], [1478, 1488], [1514, 1524], [1545, 1551], [1607, 1610], [1612, 1618], [1652, 1654], [1705, 1707], [1728, 1731], [1749, 1752], [1829, 1834], [1848, 1851], [1858, 1864], [1891, 1894], [1906, 1910], [1980, 1991], [2001, 2006], [2011, 2013], [2051, 2053], [2095, 2098], [2118, 2120], [2126, 2129], [2143, 2148], [2166, 2168], [2247, 2249], [2375, 2379], [2396, 2401], [2439, 2443], [2469, 2471], [2473, 2475], [2477, 2479], [2522, 2526], [2626, 2628], [3682, 3689], [3706, 3709], [3721, 3724], [3746, 3750], [3775, 3778], [3790, 3792], [3811, 3820], [3848, 3855], [3872, 3876], [3951, 3955], [3960, 3966], [4026, 4028], [4053, 4055], [4114, 4120], [4130, 4134], [4145, 4155], [4156, 4165], [4170, 4177], [4235, 4238], [4260, 4265], [4271, 4273], [4282, 4287], [4324, 4329], [4337, 4341], [4344, 4347], [4375, 4380], [4445, 4450], [4469, 4476], [4480, 4486], [4491, 4494], [4502, 4505], [4527, 4529], [4554, 4558], [4592, 4594], [4646, 4649], [4679, 4682], [4727, 4731], [4757, 4759], [4777, 4781], [4786, 4788], [4796, 4799], [4818, 4822], [4824, 4827], [4881, 4885], [4898, 4903], [4906, 4908], [4912, 4914], [4920, 4924], [4936, 4939], [5057, 5059], [5075, 5085], [5124, 5126], [5140, 5142], [5168, 5170], [5178, 5180], [5182, 5187], [5201, 5204], [5260, 5264], [5280, 5283], [5286, 5288], [5296, 5299], [5312, 5314]], "howto": []}, "ID": "13"}, {"title": "Study Hour with Rachel Bradley", "url": "http://streamprod-eastus-streamprodeastus-usea.streaming.media.azure.net/bae6289c-10fc-4df9-9e07-2e78ab094eaf/output.mp4", "transcript": "Alrighty hey everyone, today no is going to be hanging out with me, so it's not just me noise in the background. Um? Screaming in the background. That's always good. Um, so today we are shifting tempo away from the more long study that I have been doing. I fancied everything but faster, and we're going to be doing gesture studies, so this is something that I am personally kind of nervous about streaming, because I anything that's fast and loose. Get really uptight and scared. I'm definitely like a rendering like spending 40 hours on something kind of person, not someone who's confident doing 5 minute drawings. So we're going to be doing this today. I thought there's no better way than like to gain confidence in something than doing it publicly, so we're going to be shaking some bad roads today. I'm just going to do this so I did a few and I paste them on Twitter and I actually been pretty clearly turning out so we gotta carry on doing these. If you guys want to access the reference pack that I'm using, there's a link. In the assets along with this video. So hello to everyone joining us. All Lego notice posted that in chat. So yeah you can. You can join along with that if you fancy. 300 and one of the sample packs right? Quite possibly. And the. Yeah yeah, yeah. Now there's a free one. The second sample pack needed. Awesome. Thanks honey. So my son, I've opened a bunch of reference photos and I'm planning to not keeping a strict timer on these because that's just too large inviting for me, but I am probably going to be spending kind of maybe like 10 minutes on them, not focusing on accuracy of proportions, but more focusing on trying to get a sense of movement exaggerating proportions. Yeah, trying to get a really strong gesture and a sense of movement throughout so. Yeah, I'm going to be using it. Basically a hard round brush that I've played around with to make a bit more organic so it's actually got a new layer so. It's just basically like a hard round that I've made into an Oval based machine. It and added a slight texture and capacity controls, so that's all I'm going to be using. It's pretty easy. Say Hey Alright, let's get going. Start with the paint like I. I don't have a good workflow for this yet an I. Especially the whole talking all doing this. This is going to be a challenge for me. Keeping it really simple. Start by getting like the tilt with the shoulders and their hips and also the way that that also is facing is really important so. Making me wanna figure drawing well then why don't you? At work. Well, now you know how it feels. I mean sitting next you doing so many figure during the last couple of weeks before I get you back. But yeah, I think you mentioned something that I think is really important gestures, because that you're not putting a time limit on 'cause everyone thinks that. Jasper Johns pass be done fast. But they don't have to be super fast, right? Getting gesture is kind of almost an analytical process. And sometimes going slow with this kind of handy, right? 'cause like you happily. Stylized stuff and interpret stuff to get the Jester. So yeah, configure tree. Yeah, sure, hurrying. It just like I just said. Never enjoyed hurrying study that I understand why, but for me, that's a very specific skill set that you're learning. I don't think it necessarily makes you a better artist. It makes you a faster artist. I understand what is the boiling down to got something hard? Time these legs. But I feel like I personally learned just more fun things when I'm when I'm free to think about it. It's more important to me than thinking about what I'm studying. Then I'm doing it really fast. How are you guys doing today? It's actually kind of good practice for me. I don't care my fingers. Yes. The wire rated at. I'm crazy, I'm a fool. Alright, so let's fix these proportions then. Not fair. I want long legs. Yeah, this is my subconscious getting through here. This is like, well, Rachel is. Please. I'm gonna be able to do this work. Yeah, dream locker. Come say hi written by. Probably also gonna be working a bit slower on the news because I'm talking not just thinking which. Not my Forte, honestly. It is normal and traffic. Then Slow another there in Boulder line going on. Just being really simplifying down the costume, just I capture the bits that will show like motion and asked me about the way that I think you can reasonably. Yeah, there's so many people that yeah. Just never be able to do it. Symmetry is hard. Thank you for the encouragement, so I'm telling me my name wrong, thinking that catch the bad. I appreciate that I get so self conscious about sketches. Good Lord. I'm getting better about it. It is something that. Getting I guess better at drawing. It just means that naturally your sketches turn out a little bit more like you intended to do first time and. Something is definitely improving with time, but you would have anxiety without that. No. :) Were like getting better or really sells getting more money. There's something about are things like always did think you're always going to feel like an impostor. Never go to the artist ever like Super Keys? The central part comes out. It will get better and start failed to actually get things that email with cool tends to end up looking for. It is. Lydia start out. You can have in Bolivia. Possible fit on the page understand. Translate convention in June in Filipino has not like a lot of money. Beautiful coming up with ideas. Agreed. How is better question but playing Walker and Walker? Would you like to be painted? Good question. It probably has to be Nyssa really. I know about the really easy also, but I like playing green decks like elves. Like for a see things. So probably had to be necessary I reckon if I did some research I might be able to find. Maybe something a little more of skewer that you've put off my head has feelings for. Yeah, that would be Windows 8 for you, Yeah? I'll be. It is. Probably yeah, that's right. She did pretty good one. Your folders full is rarely. No listening. It's like vaguely familiar. Google. Seems like these days. People. Business. Hip hop. Soul food filled the hole in your heart with nothing but love but amusing. And only the crowd. Where do I ask you what those working on today now? Are you working on today now? I. The harder but it's so happy it's their happiest art. It makes me so happy. . But I'm working on three times longer than others, yeah? I love your snake. This thing done by someone who didn't look at the things before hand, but that's kind of snake. Alright alright. They are peculiar creatures. When you think about it. OK. Hey how you doing? Say my name wrong? Oh yes, please do correct pronunciation. Music. But it is. Still killer. So after that you like pressing just received it for us. Oh my gosh, I tell you what they are. A large part of the reason why I'm doing studies like this right now, because the way that you stylize anatomy just mind blowing. I saw him and I was like that's how I want to be able to draw. Alright, that's probably good enough for this one. Need a good break in warmup sketch and this new turn out the way. But there are two ways to that one. Can you computer? Little bit delayed response there you'll pump compliment. Got queued up inside it would take issue. Alright, I'm down. This one I thought we had someone speaks, there's potential for a lot of movement in there, but it's actually quite static, so I thought it would be fun. Kind of fun too. Next time I don't push it up. Oh good looking housing it right. Yeah yeah. What are you working on today, man? Proportions be damned. This is an absolute like. No. Thanks. Little Kelly Oh yeah. Fun stuff. Effectively you yeah I kind of made that one up, but I thought it would be good to help it read. It isn't quite like that in the reference, but I decided that having that there would be a good indicator of what's in front of behind and. And just like is a sense of 3D that. Try to slide around in this timeline for her to play into. This pros might make it. Do you think I need to drop that head down a little bit? Set too high. What did you find to the right? This handy having an artist spell, slave labor help. Right, This is wrong. I'm just raising Melissa's thoughts on what we were saying. One thing I do want to mention there so she said that. I think your followers came more about your lives then you might imply. That's absolutely true, but I think that that is because we've kind of gone out of our way to be nice. Well, followers. My point is, if all we did was post pictures and not try to kind of engage back, they probably would care a little bit less. I think we're carrying it can be a one way thing, but I think that the caring becomes more genuine minutes or two way exchange when people are engaging with us and we are engaging back, I always think that's a little bit more of a genuine care, I suppose. But then this is just false work faster. There are plenty of people who had phenomenal success in their fans care. Great deal about them without that side of things. Hum. Yeah, I think it's. Yeah, it's kind of something that happens after people like here is that they start terrorizing. Only you can. Family room itself from nothing coming in. Assume that people are something that I care about you like why you're just Larry Art and stuff, right? Yeah, I think that's more of a symptom of growing ventilated, followed, right? Yeah, didn't mean to imply dial followers don't care about us. Yeah, right absolutely. Shopping in Florida do. So yeah, now they definitely put in my 2. It's better if you assume that. Maybe just seem rather than to it than to assume they don't care to assume that you have to own that. Care is probably the more accurate thing to describe their. It's best not to assume that someone will care by default, because that by default is implies like a one-way exchange, like you're not giving anything but you expect people to care for you. Which is. That's quite a selfish take, I think. Be honest with me. Feel like we have a genuine back and forth of care with our followers. Was so grateful. Alrighty, probably long enough in this one is a lot about it. Thanks. My feeling quite I've ever had too skinny. I think white white. Nickel out inside of it. Last July. So yeah, I think if I spent one that's going to get into like picking out details and not necessarily bad at making it better. Yeah, you know, I feel like I did an OK job of salvaging something that was started very difficult. Kind of got it there. Alright, I'll pass in line with the rest she gonna start a\n Like Exercise for my side. She. All right? I think it was really challenging if you can't see the legs, but I might have to do that flurry of fabric to kind of feel that honestly.

Yeah, how is everybody who work in Larkin? Feel free to pop into chat. I feel free to continue working in marketing. It's up to you. But I have this. Pinterest Board of environment references that I pulled yesterday, so I thought. I would do one of these. I kind of think the captains one here might be fun. Yeah, let's do this characters one. I'm working in art boards in photo shop. Would allow me to have multiple documents and on my board but also. Allow for. The. Images that I use as reference to sit outside the artboard sit outside the document in photo shop. That's great. Honest, this is probably. This is easily probably one of my favorite things about this is one of my favorite photo shop updates with the Artboards. 'cause I can do. Stuff for clients an. And how's the mall in one document? It's like if I'm doing it in illustration system where it needs to work on XY and ZI can have XY and Z laid out and I can do a whole spread of stuff and figure out what works together and. Make sure things stay cohesive and consistent. But I also I'm gonna change my artboard to landscape. But I also like that. When I do sketches for my clients I can also do all of the sketches in one document. And. Make sure that they stay consistent and they look like they should look as a group. I'm pretty sure this is live now, so I'm going to pull it up and just show you guys. Right? Here we go. Actually, when I was doing this for a client. Um? Taking a hot moment to load. There we go. I did this for Grand Rapids magazine. And. I wanted to make sure that all the openers for the article stay the same, so each of each section was its own grouping of stuff and so I had to make sure that everything looked consistent. So this is how I laid everything out in my documents that I can make sure that. The consistency state and things changed a little bit from where this was to the very end, but. It really worked out that I was able to. To see this because of art words. Hi Darius, top of the modern India. Pop up Ted. You can do it. Go back. You can do it, good boy. For this too, I might. I might pull out one of my old. Brush packs they may need. 'cause I think it might help a lot. Put priority like yesterday. It's been a long time since I have truly done like landscape studies. And when I did I was studying in Rome, Italy. This is about this 1010 years ago that I was doing them when watercolor. And like looking back, I was like I wish I had experimented more, but I was very much I much style back then was like I drew a lot of realism. I didn't really stylize things. At which point, like? Multiple injuries in my mom finally went to the principle and just like listen, this isn't OK. She got, she got dodgeball banned from school 'cause that was the one. That was like the one game that constantly. Constantly would injure me. And it got to the point where she was like if they play it, pretend you got hit and walk off. Side play for like 3 minutes and I'd run back and forth and then I have a ball came within my vicinity. I'd walk off. 'cause I was like I don't want to be the last one because I don't win. I just get 10 different. Rubber rubber balls whipped at me so hard that they feel like freaking rocks. Um? But I I just think we remember losing a contact. Ones like it came out and I couldn't find it because they hit me in the eye and then. They hit me in the mouth and they have been the notes. I had several nosebleeds over that time, like it was just not good. But then my mom was like, why do you let the like? Why do you let the boys do that? So like they were told to hit below the waist? Well, they don't. Cody Berry, you're the one who's got her in PD two. Yeah like. Elementary school PE wasn't too bad. I hated fitness tests. I hated fitness testing. It was the worst. Because I was not an athletic child and. But like we had. We have archery days an I really loved archery like when we had archery week. That was the fun week for me. Everything else I didn't care for, but archery was fun. So in like the week that you learn like square dancing and stuff, you also learn how to juggle scarves like that. I was good at. Like the not physical physical activity with my thing. We played Rugby, Cricket, Baseball, Hockey, St and Fields Tennis, an murderball with murder ball that dodgeball. 'cause that would explain? That would explain things. None of your schools had Archer. I'm honestly surprised they like they let elementary school kids do archery, 'cause like we had full on like Boero like you had to wait for everyone to finish before you could go retrieve your arroz. I'm surprised they got away with that. But it was fun. I did really enjoy archery. Was I graded it? No, but it was enjoyable. It'll warm this up a bit. What I'm doing right now I'm just laying down some very basic colours and then I'm going to start layering on top of it and creating texture and things. Like I'm half tempted. I'm bringing my iPad with me on my on my fishing trip. But I'm. I'm half tempted to. To bring light colored pencils in the sketchbook and just kind of go nuts, but. Also don't want anything going overboard on the boat so. A few times they played American football. What you would call football without the padding. Yeah, that's how we played it in school is like you didn't have padding, you had a flag. As a flag football see flags around your waist and if someone take your flag, had like three flags new route. I think we played basketball, but it was like you split up into groups so it depended the group you are with. How intense it was. So like I think I was in the group that we were very chill and we would just try to dunk the fat like we just try to get the basket. Kickball, I didn't enjoy either. 'cause like. The one thing that really sucked about school PE and stuff was like once you got sweaty, you were sweaty because we were in Florida. And they would have us out playing in the heat and there like, well, it's morning, I'm like. But then were sweaty and gross all day. And. PE thankfully like it was a it was a rotation. So like one week with art one week with music, one week with P and it would it would alternate. Ann Or you know it did we always have? We might have always had PE and then art and music rotated, but. I always look forward to art and music like those are my classes. Um? But the. But what they say? I lost my train of thought Yeah morning. But yeah, I really didn't care for PE like I was really happy in high school that I didn't have to take it. 'cause like. I remember in fifth grade everyone starts going through puberty and things. Um? And I had this kid next to me who. For the everyday after recess. I would get headaches. And. I kept telling my mom when I get home I've had a headache all afternoon. She's like why? And I said it happens after reset. I said so and so next to me smells really bad and she put two and two together and she contact my teacher and she's like hey what's going on? Can you figure this out? Well, it turns out the kid that sat next to me, his parents gave him Cologne. So he was wearing Cologne in the morning. And then after PE it would Cologne an boy sweat and it was really bad and it was so strong and I was very sensitive to to that sent. Like I was very sensitive to just like that in general that it was giving you migraines everyday. And so she contacted his parents and was like listen, he can't wear this. It's too strong, too strong, it's affecting the kids in class and. And then I think she ultimately like moved him so that. Like she shuffled the class so that. I would stop getting migraine. 'cause once you once you stop wearing it, I stop getting migraines. If they're in the Olympics and they are sports, thank you. Figure skating is a sport. I get so many people I don't get them, but like people on the Internet always like figure skating is, that is for its artistry. But if you're not playing against people like you are competing and you were doing things smarter than most people can ever do. Figure skating is a sport, you're just do it when you look awesome. Stuff is in the Olympics. It is a sport. Things that should be in the Olympics are synchronized skating. 'cause that is a incredible piece of artistry. Andy Yeah Olympics is for it's yeah. I think this seems to be like the dark purplish color here, so I need to cover that in. Right now I'm just like I'm still very loose with everything. 'cause I'm just going to keep layering and layering. Because I want it's an effect I want to try to achieve, but it's a. It's interesting. 'cause I like I said I don't do this. I've seen work from a few artists that I. That do very young. Kind of like abstract looking. Landscapes and I really like how they look and I'm trying to figure out how they do it. And how I can incorporate that into the work that I do? Because something like this where things are just very wild colors. I think would be really really fun for my kids book. I love snowboarding, even though I've never done it myself. I've always wanted to learn. You know, it's funny, like I had something I would like to learn, but I'm. I'm too scared as an adult to learn that sort of thing. I was very nervous and scared as a kid to to learn that sort of stuff. It's amazing. I love ice skating. Cody says ha, my husband and I just got new rollerblades with both. Haven't done it since we were kids. From Dana says they make special ones with Stoppers in the front and rockered wheels for figure skates, artistic inline skaters. So if you don't know what rockered means, it means, uhm, instead of the wheels all being. In a line. There. More like this. It's not that in that it's not that exaggerated, but it's just. There's a little bit of. Africa rocking horse And. Like ice skate blades. Are like that they're not flat. Which is why people can roll roll upwards to jump in and take off. Fun fact you learn today. Yeah, they made they made roller skates that mimic ice skates. They do not mimic ice skate. I tried, I couldn't do it. I didn't buy thing with like. I don't want to get injured and I don't want to hurt myself and then find myself off the ice. Um? I think if I had. Put them on my ice skates that I use regularly that actually fit my feet. I might have had a better experience, but I also didn't know how long is the blast and I didn't want to take the blades off 'cause they're perfectly like they're set exactly where they need to be. Um? I love the color pencil texture Shawna. It looks great. Thank you. Hot tub in the snow is best. Yeah it was. So it was kind of like it was really fun. I'm not sure I'm really caring much for the smudge here. That's not this much. Um? I'm not sure I really care for how that looks 'cause like I'm trying to make it. I want it to look kind of more like watercolor and it's not so. We're just going to going to back space here. We're going to bring back all my texture. And I'm going to switch back to my brush. And then I'm just going to keep layering. This may be the only thing we work on today, but I'm going to make it work. It's OK, Dana. My rank is open, I just have to like. I have to call and schedule and pay ahead and it's just like it's stuff that I'm like. I don't want to get on. And then be off again for another week. So I'm just at this point. I'm like what's one more week. So at this point I'm like 2 weeks out from skating again and I can work with that. 'cause the first session is literally going to be just me flailing like like Bambi while I get used to being on it again. You know, and that's that's if things continue, I gotta see, you know, we got to see what the governor says about everything and. Go from there. So what I'm going to do as I proceed further with this as I'm going to add some color in here, that's like not. In the image I'm going to use like you know, Blues but also yellows and like things to really kind of pop it out of it. And just make it really visually interesting. Think it worked. Tim Gunn. Yeah, there's the thing that sucks is like this. The boots I was using like their their tapered forward whereas I need a more rounded to box. So they were crushingly my toes in a not good way. Like I put them on and I was like how did you skating these for juniors? What are you guys working on today? What's happening? What are you doing? Does anyone want my Pinterest for us? So we got my Pinterest for it all? Pull it Up 'cause This is what I'm working from is. This folder. The hard thing for me to think that I'm like trying to train myself to do is to really see the nuances in. In what I'm looking at. 'cause my brain tends to get overwhelmed when it looks at something like this where there's a lot of. A lot of things going on. So I'm trying to get my brain to like break it down into just the simplest of shapes. Sketching some crystals. What kind of crystals? I have a whole type drawer crystals. I've got them on. I gotta run up on my wall. There. I keep crystals at my desk I've got. Kind of little rose quartz that I keep here. And this is one I got. Little fidget crystals basically like I find if I'm anxious or whatever, I'll grab them and I just. Hold on to them. And it went behind my desk. Oh well, I'll take care of it later. As it may not have, it may be just slightly too wide it down there. Um? My favorite crystal is Smokey Quartz. I have that. I have multiple of those. I've got one of my type doors. It's like this. Beautiful, really dark black color. It's like a really dark grey, almost black solid smoky quartz. I've got a huge amateur ring on my table. So for this so far I've only been working on one layer. And when I take off the sketch, it actually looks like colored pencil, which is kind of cool, yay. I did things. This isn't like old old brush I made. But I love that it looks like colored pencil. But once I start adding more stuff into this, I'm going to I think switched to a new layer so that I can. Keep going with this without like ruining the base color. Hawkeye insisting some studies for shapes amethyst. This Cool Square Orange one trying to figure out what it is that rain. If it's if it's orange, it's either citrine. For Orange calcite. Um? Fidget crystals are great. Yeah, I have one. It's blue. It's like a man made crystal, but it's blue and it's got gold specks in it and it's Square. I got it when I was in New York last year an I love it 'cause it's just I can hold it and hold it. It's a very. It feels good when you hold it. Um? Cody bear I love amethyst and Rose Quartz. Can I add an email to the pic? Maybe we'll see. Um? Well, it looks great without the sketch. The negative space is really nice. Is this in reference to the emu farm off test? Again tonight 80. No, just be fun. If the email was in the pic. I'm curious why my. Here we go. Citrine Yep, was just going off some random interest signs yet. Citrine is Great, Citrine is the success stone. And it's supposed to bring you abundance. Smoky quartz is supposed to like fend off negative energy. Ann So anytime I go to. This sounds really hokey, but whenever I go to conferences, I've made several crystal necklaces that I wear, and I've got one that I upgraded. Let's do. Another 'cause we can. Please save this going to pull up my Pinterest Board. So we tried, should we do? Like the Lily pads might be kind of pretty. Open a new blank. See without one looks like. This is fun. I did um references. This is. This is down the road from Maine. You can tell it's a newer photo because of the Kickstarter. Help us. It, kickstarter.com. But The Antioch Theater and it is still there. It's got a little awning now and it looks they do like one movie a month. Um? But yeah, this is where I live. I kind of want to see like. I'm going to add this to my. Reference sheets. OK, let's go back to this. I'm gonna do. This Lily pad still I really I think this is pretty. I'm going to copy the image. And I'm going to go in here and I'm going to paste it. And then I'm going to pull it off of my art board. And if anyone doesn't know what this is, art boards in photo shop and. It's. Words in photo shop. And it makes it very easy to work on multiple compositions in one file. Steven says one of the things that often gets mentioned in photo retouching tutorials is never used black or white because nothing is ever 100% flag or 100% White and less your exposures way off. Yeah, that's very true. Coffee 30. And now it's on to the sparkling water. And it's caffeinated, sparkling water. Haven't playlist going in the one I'm going, it's like. The song I had happening was like, way too intense for this portion portion. OK. Randy softy shader again. If anyone is curious about this brush, it is from my pencil pack on creative market. You go to creativemarket.com/shaunaparmesan. And you will find it there. But it is a whole pack of. Pencil brushes for Photoshop that look like pencils. What a novel. I'm going to make this a bit bigger. So this is I like to work digitally. If I can change things like.

But yeah, like if I have Skype open and I'm trying to work and I'm trying to watch somebody or talk to someone while I'm doing it, and if I ever if I get anywhere near ours, zoom or whatever, anywhere near that. The window that. You know that session is in. It just immediately after restart services every time. But the yeah, let's do warmups. I want to jump. I want to do warmups with color this time. I'm just going to start throwing down some stuff and this is all free form. Really this is not I don't have anything planned, I'm just going to see where. See where we go. I'm on the background of course, as he didn't notice that will just start over here. Now I'm not awesome. OK. Is it something I've been doing lately just to mix up? Instead of just working in grayscale. So much. Just to mix it up. Don't know this is going to turn out, doesn't really matter, this is just loosening up for the drawing later. But if anybody has any questions, feel free to ask at any point. Otherwise, I will be just sketching and. Yeah. Painting. I will be talking a little bit about composition, which I will admit is I feel like one of my weaker. You know one of the things that should improve on and working on, but I feel that way about everything I do so. You always learning, always trying to get better. You have to restart it occasionally. Have you ever tried the story starting the services? Instead of having to restart, well, I don't know if you're talking about restart the machine or turn the tablet off and on again. We tried turning it off and on again. You get bonus points if you know where that quote is from. What, what up Sam? How's it going? What is happening my man? How, how are things going? How close are you getting with your your challenge piece? I haven't been fair, fair. Is this a fair warning? But I've been following your challenge stuff very much lately. I was in at the time. I see something some stuff pop up on. Twitter every now and then, but. There's a lot going on right now. I hope itself it's. Coming along. Screw this up a little bit. I'm going to crush are darks, give us a little bit more about that. Yeah I'll go a little bit on the I'll go I'll push the lighter colors in a little bit but I'm going to crush these darks even more. Crunch everything in. I'm going to stay relatively lose on these anyway, so I'm not like. Not really going for anything, I'm just kind of loosening up like I've mentioned. OK, Cool Daniel. Got all six characters roughed in. Is it how many requires or is that just something you're doing? And. Sadly, with today's character I saw I caught the tail very tail end of your. Twitch stream. I think I said bye. I said, I think that I think I said later Sammy or something was the only thing I had time to say it. Like right? Miss that stream. I'm gonna give him a little bit more realistic skin tone, hopefully. Not that it really matters at this point. No, this is a little broken. Pop in here with a little red. Free Orange, Orange Red. See if we can see what's happening here. Change this up a little bit so it's a little less wonky. Fix required OK? Uh, I don't know everything. I don't know, really know what's going on with it. If you want to fill me in that, be very not no worries. So do you need like fully finished or is it just concept? Is it like? And I've never done in art station challenge, so I really don't know what they consist of. I'm assuming this is. Yes. Standard artstation challenge stuff. I don't know. I've never done one, like I said. Yeah, this guy is better jaundice. Going on is very yellow. I don't think I'm going to get to where I'm going to switch over real quick and just start a new one. Kind of like. Some of the impression this is giving. Do you wanna try a couple things real quick though? Talk about some. Back that up a little bit. See if we take this a different color. So so sorry. Oh yeah, let me switching back. And I like to do this just for my own. My own giggles, I guess. I really like making the tips that you're really red. Lately I don't know. That'll probably change at some point, but just for fun and. You know, quick recognition that there's. There's blood in their blood in there. Sounded weird, don't know why it sounded weird, but. But it still feels a little detached for Maine. Not going to spend a whole lot of time making this year though. Spent way too much time on this already. Then I usually go in with like a little you know the ears. Usually I know this might sound gross, kind of oily, or at least the skin texture is slick. So you're going to get some odd reflections in there. And it's reflecting the light in this case. But not so much on the Lobe. If you're looking at your love. It tends to have a little fuzz on it, so it diffuses the light a little bit more. Hum. What else to say about an ear? No, I don't want it to look like it's attached to the neck. I'm gonna bring that little line that comes up. A little bit further. I hope some of this makes sense. Another thing I like to do with female characters, which this started out. It's not quite as female as it once was, I think. But that's fine too. Is, uh. With the jaw area I like to soften. The next between the chin and jaw. Unless I'm going for specifically like Oh, you know they need to be. They need to look like a chiseled jaw for some reason, which does come up from time to time. But the reason being mostly is. Does it have? Men are usually associated with a sharp jawline. And it helps cells, cells it a little bit more I think. But again, it's not always the case. Actually, I'm gonna use this, just straighten out our draw a little bit. I don't want quite as. Highlighted as it is. But it will have, like the little little bit. Probably more in here too. All right? Man, I still want to make sure this looks like it's. OK, I think I think we can live with that. I know there's like obviously there. Sure, this would be all the probably have its own little here. Here in light action going on. Maybe even. Right there. I get it. OK, I get it. I will do this real quick as the last thing. Change this brush. Might get a little bit right there. Something like that. Anyway. I don't know. So this is what we did for warmups. This guy in this this lady. Will leave it at that. But now we will jump back into our. A party planning here. They actually took a little bit longer than I want to be out about an hour and a half hour and 1520 minutes left. I'm gonna work on the composition of this and then work on cleaning up the drawing a little bit. Will pull this up. I think I still have it. No, it's not in here. Just to kind of recap. Z. Well, let's see. Let's see if I can find this file. Maybe it wasn't here, let's see. Oh yeah, it wasn't here. Yeah, here we go. So just to recap. So we did a bond of ice a bunch. It was a few thumbnails. Let me turn them, see them, turn them on. There we go, did a few thumbnails working this all out. Chose six and five. Decided more on six. You can't really read the number one and two 'cause they're yeah we go. Yeah, so that's where we started with all of this, getting an idea of what we wanted. Uh, I had a few ideas from that point and then we chose those two that took us too. See. Did not label is, so of course. So these are the two that we landed on, changed a few things from this one. And then wound up where we are now. With this drawing. And from their heads, more thoughts. and I definitely have some anatomy stuff that needs to be taken care of. Which is what we're going to do. Tonight. But first I want to work on the composition stuff. And it's going to be. So what I want to do is going to give me a little more room. I'm going to bring everything over slightly again with. This is where we started. But the biggest change? See none of this really matters, drawing Wise, 'cause we're going to redraw it anyway, or at least work on it. So I want to keep trying to find a way to emphasize, try and emphasize the math and how just how large the Loxodon is compared to the rest of the characters. And I want to try having her be hunched over the table. Um? Relatively same pose. But allowing us to really encroach upon how big their space and how big. Add to how big she actually is, and she's not doing it. Intimidating, intimidating way 'cause they're all part of the same party, and you know that kind of stuff and plus it can give a little bit of a little bit more information to. This guy's line of action right here is going to be more or less. This. Once we like, I wanted to look like he's kind of being pushed out of the way. Um? And this guy is the other ad sort of added bonus. I think we can bring him in. A little closer. Again, will probably draw these, but just for my own. So he gets brought into the Group A little bit more. And I think that's going to help. Candles and you know all kinds of stuff. Maybe a Lantern? I don't know, I don't know. This guy has a. 'cause the braided. Mohawk Get into the actual ends and outs of that in a later time. That's not right. Oh yeah, that was the thing I was going to work on me. I don't want to add a table like ending weirdly right here. It doesn't need to do that now. It can just be extended. We can have more papers on it or whatever we want. Coming off doesn't even. Long as I'm not making a tangent here, it doesn't really matter. Oh yeah, that was the old finger. Not the new finger. New and improved looks at on finger. Uh, yeah, and this guys anime face bothers me a lot. A lot of work to do on this, but I'm going to do a, uh, think the plan is to do a mock up. Hum. Very scale. Are you know, lighting sort of mock up. So I can mess around with that before diving too deep. Yeah, I think it was gonna have this guy leaning in a little bit more too, but I don't know that we need it. So we finally got the real. The real news. The news of the summer for me and Sarah. And I already planned on not going. But, uh, uh. Dragon con officially announced that they were canceling. I mean, it's kind of obvious at this point, but. They wouldn't release that info. Mainly we think because they have a lot of contracts to settle and they wanted to make sure they work those out before they cancelled. So that they weren't probably weren't responsible for any dead money. Um? In rolling over contracts to next year and that sort of thing. Hopefully hopefully next year. But yeah. So if anybody didn't know there was going to drag con. This happened yesterday, by the way. Now you know it's official. They took forever man they were. They were holding out. But we already have rooms for next year. Which seems to be the main problem. It is flat in the background out to what I might do is. Do something like this. So that they're going back at an angle. Obviously not. I mean the bar and everything would have to be made. To fit that, but. 'cause that's pretty flat. I don't know if I like that. Let's see if we did it this way. Have everyone coming out at them a little bit. That's not bad. Then we could have room for like. Little reflected beer bottles and stuff in the back. Bring our heroes back to the forefront. Yes. Uh, it's a It's about that time, guys. Will just recap what we did today. We kind of did a little bit of it. Went too long on our warmups. Oh well, I could show you this. You've probably already seen it, but these are characters actually. You've got the T fling. Who is? Gentleman right here. And then you have. Our dwarven Bard Guy turned white look like him now, but he's going to have a beard and all that stuff. That's This guy. He doesn't have a beard 'cause originally he was over here. And then we have. River or go to the. The cleric, which is terrible. That this guy he is now over here. And then our loxodon which I wanted to do more of a rough rough up paint. Got it. There we go, so we got that one done. Um? And then so those are these characters. This is, of course, the luxilon. I like the change of her leaning in. Now, I really, I really think that helps the nude quite a bit honestly. There's a lot to work out still, but. I think this might be her other pauldron that's what that's called shoulder armor. Yeah it is. That is what it's called. So yeah anyway, what we did tonight we we of course cleaned on the cleaned up this quite a bit. We started with. A couple of sketches, drawings whatever you want to call 'em paintings. Real rough color paintings that were fun. I'm getting in the mood for doing this kind of stuff a little bit more. Usually start to warm up. User is more than just a drawing, but like jumping into color and uh. It's fun and then we cleaned up our party painting and that's about it.

How are you? Hey hi hello. Welcome to the stream. I'm Shawna Lynn on hand lettering artist illustrator in the Chicago area and it's been over a week since I streamed. So we'll see how this goes. I'm already getting dropped frames, so this could go really bad if I'm not careful. Which is a shame. But we'll see. Um? Yeah. So how is everyone was new? What's happening? Let's now what's happening. What's going on? This past week I was in northern Wisconsin and I was social distancing on a Lake on a boat with my dad, my sister Anne. We were fishing all week. I caught a muskie finally so I can now say I've done that. In the past I have had three on my line and when I was there last year. I caught on an. It broke my line and took my lure. I caught it this year with the same type of lure. Got it in the bulletin actually like got a photo with it so it was I think. 23 inches like it wasn't a very big muskie, but it was a muskie accounts and I said I was going to catch a muskie this year and that's what I did. So I gotta gotta muskie and then I got a lot of rock bass. But among the three of us, we ended up catching 79 fish in the. Week that we were there. What streaming is this Ms paint? I'm working? I see that you're working very hard mud. Very, very hard. But yeah, so I took them. And I don't want to rasterize that. I took some photos, I was up there and I thought I might do some. Some studies of things I'm just not sure of what yet, but I'm going going to hang out for like an hour. Um? Whoops, wrong one. So these are. These are photos from Minocqua. I'm just going to pull them off my art board and then as I need them, I will. I will pull them back on. But like all these, Lily pads were from an area that you had to use that rolling motor to get to. And. Because it was only like. 1. Wanted to two feet deep so you couldn't use like you couldn't use your big motor to get in there. He had to use that rolling one in like it was like you're playing a game to get through there. But Is a beautiful little little ride and it took us to this area in the back. That secret Lake basically. This was our cabin. This is the cowboy stayed in all week. They had no AC. Hi Anthony, beautiful images. Thank you. I took them. Figured I'd just take a bunch while I was up there. Then I gotta decide like what I'm going to draw. I'm going to start with this one. Oh, that's why it looks so pixelated. 'cause This is a 5 by 7 paper. Yeah, OK. I gotta make it a little bit bigger here. And these aren't going to be. Very accurate in terms of like. Like they're not going to be accurate there, just you know their studies there there. They help us. I made a new layer. I also got the best comfy's new quilt while I was up there so that was fun. But it's also like it was ridiculously hot all week. Like I'm I'm from Florida. Originally I'm used to forgot to do my tool time. Let me start that real quick 1 second. Um? Like I'm used to. Humidity and stuff like I grew up in that. Did I like it when I lived there? No, but I. Generally, like I could tolerate it enough, 'cause I knew what to expect. And unfortunately, like. I've been gone, but I don't live there for a year and a half and so I'm not used to that humidity in that heat anymore. And up here for about 2 weeks every year in the summer we get. So we get heat and humidity that is Compara Bulto Florida. And there are times when it is warmer up here that is down there. And. It ended up hitting. It was like the high 80s most of the week, but then, like at night it would drop to the low 60s. Did I noodle any fish? What does that mean? Said I noodle any fish. Catch them with your hands. Oh no, no no no no no. I did get to. Are rocks as with no no bait. We ran out of having some fun. It's just like live bait using worms. And. Ended up having. We ran out and so I just like for kicks through my lower back in. I just had like a worm Hut like a warm jacket on mine. And. It ended up catching up like a small rock fast with then I was like, well, that's fun and then I think my sister called like a perch or bluegill with it with no bait. I did use a fake bleach and I almost have like something huge on my line and. I pulled it away too fast, not realizing that something had caught my something was actually going after my lure. I thought it was stuck in the weeds. Um? So that was disappointing. We did I don't know if I told anyone we actually caught a huge catfish in the Lake in here, here, here, here. Um? Just like. On a fluke. I didn't even know the least about League had catfish. But my dad had something on his line. He folded in. It's just like this giant 6 pound catfish. Also, if you are super pale like me, SPS shirts work but like. They also give you like a really weird dance. So only half my hand is tan. Right now it like great. Here's where it starts. And then I'm just pale. So I have these. I'm really weird. Damn right now. I was like, oh like this is as dark as I can actually get. But I can't. I can't stand 'cause. I burn so easily that I was just like I'm not going to risk it and then I didn't realize it didn't even take into account the fact that end up with a weird tan anyways. Too dark. I'm going to play on my side. This do not is color burn, too much screen. Right? It's too dark and see how that less is. Probably not any different, but. There's some beautiful beautiful cabins up there. I took a bunch of pictures of peoples cabins. My favorite is when, like you have all these trees and they're all you know, covering, covering, covering got the Lake down here they've got like a little doc. And then you just see like. You just see the little A-frame cabin through the trees. It was like my favorite thing to see out there. We drove home on a Friday night. We were on the water is like 2. And. It got the cabin cleaned up at the. Got everything packed in our cars. And. Then we had to get the boat trailer over to the launching the boat launch. So we could put it on and then of course. Yeah, we were in the process of putting it on. Everyone's like trailing by in a no wake area with awake going. Because of course they are. And these this couple is just there, not in the mood to wait. And their offices aside, and we're trying to put the boat on and they're just playing Peanut Gallery and like critiquing everything like just loud enough, just loud enough for us to hear. An like at one point my sister turns and she just looks at them and just goes. Ann They didn't catch the hint and so they were. Peanut Gallery we finally get the. Finally, get the boat out of water. And. Getting it going and I finally this people could hear them still going. I just look at him so. And like I kind of regret not looking at them and just saying, you realize we can hear you and you really should stop. But Karma is fun because they had a heck of a time getting their pontoon boat out of the water. He took him three tries just to get his trailer in the right spot. Almost took it right onto a doc. Um? So, Karma's son. But we ended up we went and got pizza afterwards. We didn't get on the road till. Like almost eight rolled into here at 2:30 in the morning. I was driving my car. My sister is driving her car. My dad is driving his car and he had the boats were all just like the little. This little line. And. Like 2 hours from home, I started hallucinating. Because the roads were dark and I was tired and I was just like Oh no. Oh no, I'm seeing things. This is not good. Also, I have no end game for my work today, we're just doing a fun doodle hour just because I wanted to doodle. I took all these pictures and I want to use him. That said, I am considering. Creating like a reference pack and putting it up for sale. I had a photo here and I'm not sure. Disappeared out here is. Oh, it's up there, that's why OK. But yeah, I'm considering creating a reference back 'cause I took a lot. Alot alot alot of nature photos. Like this like here is my dad's favorite leg. I don't even know what it's called. He calls it the Zen like. Our cabin This is what I think was supposed to be like a Beaver Dam. And. This is in like 2 feet. Oh if not even 2 feet of water is like one. But I could have stood in it and still then way above the water. Um? That one though, as we were coming out of that that Channel 'cause it was literally was just a. It it wound around. Ann You have, like Lily pads over here. You had trees. You had, you know? More Lily pads and Bush is like you really didn't have. Much area to work with and. So it was sort of like. It was sort of like a one way both ways, so we're exiting were like here. In this council this is family is on their boat and they decide rather than like wait the two seconds it would have taken us to get out of this section. They decided to try and show us over the side were like Are you kidding me? You couldn't wait 2 seconds like. Nothing in the world mattered, but then at that moment. Hawaii come here? What are you doing only now because? And I have teddy. Better luck next time. We had a lot that got away. And there was one morning I went out with. With my dad it was like. Overcast, which apparently is like the best time to Fish 'cause all the fish aren't, haven't they don't drive down at that point. But not only was it. Now he wasn't overcast, it was raining and like down pouring into this one place and we just we drift and. We had and he ended up catching a. But I'm getting AM. 30 he thinks it was 30 inch Northern. And I had managed to. I did not met it properly. You're supposed to go. Like you're supposed to take the net and send ticket perpendicular to the water. Where the fish is. And then he screwed him upwards and I did not do that. So he flipped out and he got away and I've got awful because I definitely no. Default setting fault. I never taught you how to net post like. But I feel bad 'cause that would have been a really big fish. Um? So we can't really cut like we count it. 'cause he still technically had it on the line and I witnessed it 'cause he's like you saw that right. All the guy I saw that I tried and it it fails. So we had a lot that like got away over the weekend over the week, but didn't catch anything at the damn. Unfortunately. We're kind of. He was hoping that we would catch something at the damn 'cause. The water has tannic acid in it, so it makes the Fish Golden. Heidi how are you? I have to say this song I'm listening to. It's really nice. There we go. I have a Spotify playlist that you can't hear called Midway called sweater weather vibes. And. It's really nice. It's very chill. I think that's almost too harsh, even though these do have a white edge. Take this and let's go light with that sort of still some green to it. Also, I am going ice skating tomorrow for the first time in 3 1/2 months. I'm so excited. My rank apparently has. Has their public sessions back up and going and. I prefer those 'cause there cheaper. I don't know if they're currently, but I asked about. I called Nashville Tuesday. Feels like do I have to pre register for those? And she's like no, we have. Like if you want to you can shows, but they've been pretty. You can walk on to those and I said, I've been pretty crowded goes no maybe 5 people so. I'm doing those, but I have to pre register for any figure skating ice time that I want to use. Which kind of sucks, but like. They have to limit how many people are on the ice. So you can only register 24 hours in advance, which I think is stupid, but that's you know that's their rule. Um? Then I have a lesson with my coach on Wednesday, so I have to get on tomorrow just to get my. She has to get my feet under me so I'm not flailing around like Bambi on Wednesday. Blending technique is on point, thank you. I've been figuring out like painting in photo shop. I'm working on a piece right now for. I'm in a light Gray art lab. Gallery show and the final is due Friday. And I wanted to get it done before my trip. But It was on. It would been too hard to make it on time for that. And it took me until today to really finalize the composition. 'cause it's it's a show called World Relay relay relay. I don't know, we let. And. They you had to like essentially like throw the dice for three different. Worlds and you got to pick the one you like the best. And so the one that I ended up choosing was. The. Tropical rainforest the theme is pacifist and. The. Metal, or like the resources precious metals. Which, like I've never drawn metal before, so this is actually a really challenging piece for me. Um? And. The final was the enlightened final part of it was the enlightened age. If I had to combine all four of those into their own little world, and so. Now that I've been working on. And. As bouncing off some friends like How do I incorporate the enlightened agent? This like I think I think in light data. I think steampunk but like how do you turn it off for reinforcing the steam punk? And I had I had created like a border almost for it, and then make the borders game lightened age part. And it worked out, so I almost finished the border I'm drawing in. Like shiny metal right now and it's it's looking really cool if I say so myself. Um? So it's I'm having a lot of fun with it. But I have to finish it by the 10th which is. Not Friday, Thursday. Oh snap. I got one last day than I thought I did. So more than likely be working on it after this stream. Family and decided I'm only staying on for an hour tonight 'cause I have to work on that and I can't stream that. 'cause they like everything. You kind of Stander wraps until the show premieres. But I want to work on it more and I've been. Recording the time lapse of it.

Speed paint maybe? And that's the goal today. I haven't done like some. Painting in awhile. I just painted portrait. Some head desired or something simple. Little League League. Cheese Chilling, how are you pretty good man? Feeling energetic today. Awake. As a mystery box challenge progressing, though, this is only my third character, so I'm still gotta some ways to go, but. I think it's getting there. Next week is going to be. I think I have two more weeks that right? No, not two more weeks. Week and a half. So this week I gotta start working up. Like outside of stream. I reckon. So after this one will be three more. So maybe I should do personal work or should work on this. I feel like doing some personal work, though you guys can't stop me. Hello thick, let's 13 mean. Could get that horn texture. So like I sounded very else just then. Get that horn texture oil your AV. I know I'm becoming Ed. I think I know. I think I'm sad and get like the winter curse word. In the morning I'm feeling like it's so hard to wake up now. It's getting cold. Hey Nadia, I always simp I you don't talk bad about my hair, but what? What do you mean? But when did I say bad things about your hair? Did I say something about your hair? I don't remember. What's the daylight lamp? To judge her damn, I don't watch Georgia. But I said I want to I. I think that's like really far down on my list of like things I want to do though, because there's so much I'm doing at the moment. Too busy. I'm going to bed on this cold this weekend. Oh, more on the weekend. We can solve for me. Oh no. On Earth, thick is mad. What are you gonna do? How thick? The lamp that simulates natural light basically. You kind of need that 'cause it's still dark outside. Maybe that's why it's cold and it's dark and like stream almost like didn't wake up today. But then after waking up I feel way better. Several theme of the characters, by the way. Ancient Tech basically. Let me open him up. It's good question, huh? So it's like civilization that uses ancient technology. And they're going to be. Let me see. Being weird is. Sketches. So this is the line up basically. We have our creature thing that transports the box and these are like the bodyguards basically. Yeah it is brave. Leda I could add some glowy stuff for her. I don't know what to add that yet, but will figure it out. There's anything I'm good at, it's figuring it out as I go. Thank you, wait for the big one, the big one. The big. This guy probably do him next will probably do her little sniper girl. We send it there. I think I worked on these in like order of what I like, so I like electric boy leader actually wanted to add like a beard on him to be honest. Might do that now it's giving little godey or something. Fat he needs it. Dang, Daniel. Done. Yo Pat. Which one do you guys like? Out of leader. Brave. An mischief mischievous. So I think that word wrong. I feel like I say it wrong. I feel like very forced when I say it and I don't know why is it mischievous or mischievous? Was of both correct? Square and hate squish to help. Oh, it's first correct? Hell yeah. Leaders pass Faith Hill, Yeah. We got some. Like the color, some brave cool. We got some nice everyone's got like their own favorite which is good. If I run says one that I should be concerned. I'd like Wolf. Play set the world like Pok\u00e9mon. 1st. For her, I think the glowy bits. Maybe I'll just focus on the horn and the eyes for the globe. Well, not really becoming Ed, that's the second sniffle I had. Dental ever said that? Same type of cadence. Considerable pacing. What are you talking about? We talked about was. Win the world with Miss Chievous. Right Americans let me know how your 4th of July was. I didn't notice yesterday, so now I have to ask you guys. How's your 4th of July? What do you do? What do you eat? Wait, no, that's not the day you eat stuff, is it? That's just that's just the day celebrating. Do stuff I guess. Is that right? This is all one layer, it is now. I had an old layered before. Um? In fact, I'm not sure these workflows with. This month's mental ship. Please join mentor ship if you'd like to learn from me. Patreon.com/chaindesigns Sign up still available. Yeah, I think Thanksgiving. Would you guys do on 4th of July? I live in. Do you guys just. Party. But then I really hope you didn't party because. 'cause you know? I don't even have to say it. Where can you join the mental ship? Could you www.payment.com/fashion designs or you can go to my link tree and find my pager on? So smooth hell yeah. Didn't even rehearse that one. Hey honestly though you can go to my description below. He can find my picture on there as well. OK, I have to make this way less static here. It's so like I do this on you later though. Just in case I've screwed up, might need to cloth reference as well, but will try to wing it first. We didn't really do anything on the 4th. Yeah. But you must do you doing here on the 4th. Even sylveon independence. Oh really, no extra, like dinner or anything. We have good dinner every day, don't you? So you like, what's the difference? Already doing that, neighbors. All know where they potting. That be pretty bad. If they were OK, I do need some cloth reference I think. How do I look for this? I think my fashion board reference would have some stuff. Get ready for some like boys. Maybe should cut it off right at the edge. I was like I thought I found the perfect reference. I was like Oh my God, this is just like my design. This was like a thought was like yes yes yes yes. And then I see this bottom part. It doesn't hit the floor. My damn it. I just do that, maybe just wanted to hit the floor. Good day hello. Young squish Well, it turns this looks alright. I think he joined like this month in it, you. I know you're in the classes now. Already halfway through the year, have you guys gone with your goals, huh? Why do you guys set out goals for yourself? Have you feel like? You've made progress and. Achieve some of the goals or like partially achieved some goals for this year. How do you forgot what I wrote for my goal? I might have a quick look, actually. Curious to see what I wrote. Or No. Discord died Odessa. Can't see my goal. Yeah, I'm excited to see what you come up with as well. Um? And feel free to jump into the other classes if you want to watch those. You don't have to wait for your lawn. If you see us in voice chat, you can jump in and. Watch some other people and see their feedback and learn from that. 'cause I think that's pretty important. Other people have overlapping issues. That can be resolved just by seeing someone else is feedback. And the more friends, the merrier. I really want to read my goal though. Yeah, discord state. Let me try out. Looks like my whole windows is dead. I'm going to say this just in case. I hope my. Can I do that? OK, I can do that. OK, but then I can't touch the windows. Other discord window. Yikes. Yeah, we actually have class in two hours as well. So you can watch those also upload the videos so you can. You can see those. If you want as well. You can watch any of them, I'll be. Updating your phone with this month's folder. Pretty soon. Off the stream maybe? I think I wrote some short term mid term long term goals. Or did I just write goal? Come on I wanna. I had this. It's actually dead. Can I album OBS? Is that still a still alive which is good, but I can't touch this either. So weird one, what happened? Hope you don't crash. Now I'll be posting it in discord. The link for it. It will be on a Google drive folder. But if you stick around in the server, we normally do our goal setting. Doing New year. We have like a self reflection thread that we do. I think it's pretty useful. Schools here runs goals as well. How long have you been doing metal ships for? Oh yeah, I think watercolors very hard to replicate for. Digital. Think traditional paintings. OK, in fact, I'll find out because I'm going to go painting for the first time this Friday. See how that goes. I'm very curious to see if I could like bringing my traditional painting skills into. Traditional. Could be very fun. Oh man, why is blue always looks so good? Off then that's it. That's an evil color right there. Probably good contrast 'cause it's like the highlight colors yellow. If I contrast that with like a purple, that's pretty good. Open we're going to be using. Hey, that's a question for future Jeff to handle. OK, I don't know I'm going to have it's going to be like instructed so I'll just use water. Using will probably most likely be. I don't do that. Oh, I meant taking my digital painting skills into traditional. See how that goes. Do I have those colors on anywhere else? I don't really have that kind of Purple E. Yeah, I don't. Or should I make it same color? Or should I make it contrast? What do you guys think? Might be too many colours if I make it contrast right? Like maybe you should stick more too. Towards what I have already. I'm a feeling I'll be using something quick that dries quickly what it is. It's like it's not acrylic. It's something else is in it. The paint. But you have a point about single. Like pink Yeah, I think if I if I bring into many contrasting ones will be too much. Especially if you look at what I have here. I didn't have like. I don't have to like, really. Loud colors on each one at visit. Many only one, so I think I'll just stick to 2 one here as well. Which I think is more catching. Gives more character. Yeah, my concern is it might bring too much for this character compared to the other ones. Since I am doing them as like a set. So if I don't have that type of treatment for these guys it might be too much for her.

Um, to connect my iPad to the computer. That way I can draw. Like using my iPad as like basically awake Wakeham Wakeham tablet uhm. I don't have boyfriend tablet. I was thinking about getting one at one point but. I had an iPad and my desk isn't that big so I didn't. I don't really want to. Take up too much room with it. So usually, like usual, I draw with this brush that I made. Ann Last night when I was in bed thinking about like what I was going to draw and started thinking. About this one kind of idea that I. Had was the possibly do stuff for the Last of Us Part 2. Play draw face and stuff but. No, maybe I will. So last time I used blending colors like. So I'd have a color. And then I'd have a color underneath it. And then. On them. But multiply, so then you get three colors. I think it'd be interesting to do. That again today. I am looking at my. Images I have saved the have any suggestions of what I should draw today? Flowers Flowers is definitely on. On the. But the high part of it. Who is Siri? Um? An instrument keep a draw this folder where it's things that I want to draw. Let's see if there's anything in there this morning. I am. So funny I'm so tired this morning. And I don't know why 'cause we didn't stay up that late last night. I'm just gonna start sketching some things. And just kind of see where it takes takes us. Um? Sometimes. You just gotta. Start drying even if you don't know. Why you're going to draw? Honestly, half the time the hard part. Is figuring out. What you're going to draw and then. Going for it because. It takes guts to, you know. Put. Ink to paper. I guess. You're drawing. Digitally, you not really putting into paper, but. I'm. You are. Taking her. Taking steps. Towards making something. I. But yeah. Anyone watching now going to watch 99 year? I've got a lot of client work today, so I will be. Turning in. So we got this boot. So eventually Valentina, good morning or good evening or Good afternoon, wherever you are joining in from. I'm just here. Therapeutically drawing. And I'm realizing. We can make a really cool pattern. If we use like like if it makes sense. Yes, good morning. I'm. It is Central time here I am in. Brenham, TX. It is a small town between Houston and Austin and I woke up earlier this morning then I'm normal. Well kind of I got more. I'm more productive than usual at this hour. I do wake up around this time.

I'm just going to say good morning to all who knows who knows? What time it is where ever anyone is? Uhm alright, let's try something else. I'm just going to draw a little little vignettes. And then maybe, maybe we'll come up with something I wanna go into more detail. With and also to see now suggestions are welcome in the chat, so if there's an object.

Doing if I could. That'll make it look a little more. Curvy Like this? So it feels more like a cowboy hat. Sure. I could shrink down her down and then make make it more of like A. 30 gallon hat. This hat is going to be very tall. And very small compared to the other things, but it's OK. Maybe it's Tony's hat, 'cause it looks like it would fit Tony. He looks. Wendy's camping ground in the Hackett said, Yeah, we're going to do that. Uh. Do you hear that? Little bit cry out. And I did like. I did like this. Let us see the highlight this thing. This makes more sense. This. Yeah. We shouldn't even. I'm going to bring the boot up a little. Kiss and get spacing going on here. Oh Hello Antonina Antonina. Welcome, thank you. Oh this that or that. I forgot I was wearing. I forgot I was wearing hat. And it. Oh, you know it's interesting. Um, something I do. Hello Nadia, welcome welcome to. Welcome welcome welcome um, I'm playing with something I played with last week, but I'm like or not this illustration, but the style of illustration. I'm going to be working on the boot shortly after this, but kind of like this like DLC this late little. Kind of thing happening where it looks like it's a linocut. I like that. But that would mean I'd have to do all the rest of this kind of looking like that. So I think I'm just going to keep it like this. But what I need to do is redraw this boot so that it. Fit the same. Uh, look is this is our friend Tony right here. Um named by our friend Louise, who just left. All right? Let's draw the bins. I'm going to grab this and I'm going to make it a multiply layer. Um? And I'm at 20. Is that when I had here? Air is it 15. Yeah, it's 20. OK. So. You gotta wear some prosper work you're doing lol. I hope you were on a horse with some fruit wow. Little. You know you can't see you, but I am actually currently on hers, but my horse is really good at standing. Um? Steven says I'm getting flashbacks to the westerns that were on TV every Sunday afternoon. They played westerns in the UK. That's so interesting. I love it. Therefore it. So here for it. Something fun to do? 2 all your drawing just for fun. He's having fun in less. You know. Also, this is a silent you're doing for a client. Is do not worry about. Filling in. All the spots 'cause it kind of gives you like this. Little nice little patches that happen. I think, uhm? Next week, so I'll be streaming. Next week on Wednesday and then. Eventually in. Um? July, I'll get back to you a normal. Streaming schedule um where I stream. Three times a week. Um? Right now I'm not streaming as much. But I will be streaming. More next month. Oh, I need to draw more. The blue I have to take this off to. Take the schedule Air Optix. To check on it shortly. Just to see if I'm getting the style that I want it just shows how good you are with training and Multitasking. Yes, I'm very good at training horses. Little known fact. Little known fact. Actually not true. I've written a few horses in my life, only a few. There so. Strong. End. Horses are huge and less. We're talking. About the tiny miniature ponies. That exists. Those are tiny and Cute. So tiny and Cute. Uhm, actually, let's take up. Got the sketch layer. For now I'm going to. You're looking at like this, so I can. I see, so I just used. I hit R and you can like rotate your cameras. Uhm, it's very helpful. When? You are. Drawing something and it's sideways. That way it's easier. To draw. Steven says yes, this was in the 70s and 80s. Saturday mornings usually featured an ulterior Lake Champion, the wonder horse what? That is so cool. Let's see. Harry Lee this I wasn't that. Uhm Hawaii. Yes Antonina. I hope I'm saying Your name right. Even knows that I am constantly asking how to pronounce peoples names because I am always saying that on streams. I am using. Um, so I'm using my iPad. Um? And connected it to my computer with this program called Astro pad. It's really cool, um? It allows me. To basically create a centriq with my. An iPad. It's uh. I was thinking about getting S antique and then like I heard about Astro pad. Um Astro pad it. Here. Astropad studio so. Um? That's what it looks like. And you should check it out because. Um? Yeah. Because the world let me switch over real quick. Um? 'cause I can check the layout on pop it in here into the restroom and studio. It's great for if you've got. If you have an iPad. And you want to. Use it like a centriq. Because things are expensive. iPods are expensive. Uhm. That's a great way to use. You are. Uh. Equipment as more than one thing. The sooner Think I'm going to move this star. OK. Whoops, forgot again. So when you're when you do rotate your canvas. It. When you're trying to move things on, the campus at Lee. Doesn't move the way it normally does, so it always kind of makes my brain go. What is happening? Um? Things like that. City. It's like normal, yeah? Oh yeah, so I was looking up. Did I do I was. What is what is? What is PCM MPA? Are the surprises of Astro pad. 'cause? Oh studio. I I tried using psyker uhm. But I didn't like the way how tiny like. Like how it brought photo shop on 2. The iPad in the way that it did, uhm. Like it felt really cramped up. One of the one of these days I'm going to. Only works with Mac. Oh OK, yeah. Uhm, but what is? PCM mean? I think Apple was trying. To like. Create uhm? Kind of the astropad thing with side fire. Hum. Hum. Oh, per calendar front now, yeah. Oh, per calendar front now, yeah. I usually I'm gonna screw, it pays for the whole year. I usually I'm gonna screw, it pays for the whole year. Right away 'cause. Right away 'cause. I'm always afraid that, like. I'm always afraid that, like. If I pay for a month, I'm not going to be able to like I have an issue affording it or something, so I'm like I gotta pay for it now because. If I pay for a month, I'm not going to be able to like I have an issue affording it or something, so I'm like I gotta pay for it now because. If I. If I. If I. If I. Wait, what if I'm like not getting as much client Oregon? Wait, what if I'm like not getting as much client Oregon? I can't afford it then. I can't afford it then. But I totally understand why people would pay monthly. But I totally understand why people would pay monthly. That's always just kind of my. That's always just kind of my. Fear of paying monthly. Fear of paying monthly. Ah, maybe I need to add. Ah, maybe I need to add. I need to absolutely right to the boot. I need to absolutely right to the boot. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm going to pull up some of the examples that I have. We have a mall on the discord. I made a little section for it called. Let's see, let's see. Let's see. Hopefully people PPP uhm. Middlesex report in a discord just called Portrait Challenge and there you kind of follow the progress. We have stuff that started back here on the first day and I was drawn buddy of mine. Uhm you, George Washington, we've done. Share Tiger King. On Glo Glo, Boxian or whatever, then devito from always sunny. You're always funny fans. Uh. And we got things like's new fan my roommate. And recently we did Brown and Taylor, so just kind of. I think the I think the succession of it. I mean this is one to two hours, so today's isn't going to be this in depth. It's going to be a closer like a 30 minute, 45 minute session. But I just wanted to. So you guys know where it's at? I'm actually going to go in. I'm going to snag the study reference over from our good friend Diane over here 2 senseless she sent. She did some sortof. She did it. Maybe she didn't. She said that she did. She told me that she did I don't want to put all this out here. Keeps get that outta here. I'll also here's the comic that I am posting shortly after stream. That's it. Uh. Where does in the song we already did that money? I gotta find that new playlist. Please reggae today can be regulated. And relaxing, right? Hanging out, by the way, hello to welcome back to Mars Maharshi, Maharshi and Sean is good to have you guys both here. Excited to have it be. The. The first inaugural. Lunchtime stream, so this is just a new time that we're kind of checking out and. I wasn't giving. Never mind. I'll give it 1 second. But yeah, OK, so we should probably figure out who we're going to draw real quick. I'm going to create a new little area. I'm gonna change it to Gray because I realized that those tones make it a lot easier. I've made so many Gmail notifications all the sudden it's terrifying. Let me see one in. Go. Someone give me a random person in the chat whenever the name of a random person to draw. Quick, quick quick I say. Give me the person giving a person to draw. Please give me a price and giving a person give me a person to draw please. All right? Take a look at somebody else, let's do. Move random person. Let's do random person. Michael B Jordan. Let's see Michael B Jordan. Need me. All right? Turn. Let's go off of this. Pick. Out of a pack and I want to go. Hey Anthony, Welcome. Welcome to it. You're saying Good morning problems. You're on the West Coast or something, but for me it's also morning 'cause I like to sleep in. 15 OK so I gotta start up the timer here. Got this. Hey Mal, welcome back my dude. Good to see here is weird time that were streaming Sheraton. Hey Hawaii, welcome everybody. Welcome back so I'm gonna go ahead and start the timer. And let's get this started with this, this, uh. Do you report it challenge? I have a class at. I did. Now. Welcome back everybody. If you watch the first time I will just talk through a few other things going to do. I like to draw an kind of find out different shapes in the portrait first so that I can kind of disassociate. The idea of features and more focus on the idea of shapes helps me draw and proportion better. And so that two senseless taught Maine and it has been very helpful for Maine. Uh. But it's kind of like me drawing on his face is right here. You know that it just kind of just like general. Kind of really. Squared champ, like normally you can draw like a circle of sorts, but his kind of seems like this. OK yeah sure man. Yeah, they're pretty one, not Maine. Also, do things that line up to see where stuff. Like the side of his nose doesn't really have any signifier. On the side of his people. On this side kind of lines up with his mouth and then on this side of the sentences which is interesting. So we're going to see how that plays out. For further, do you just joining? Also, I'm just talking about they don't have too much time to stream today, so this is going to be a quick one. This is probably going about 30 minutes of drawing a portrait. So please bear with Maine. Sorry for the shorter stream. Tomorrow we back with all the normal longer one. Look at stuff to do. Anything exciting happen anyone's life in the last day or so. I had a huge spider that. Crawled across my wall last night while I was streaming, but the clip in the clip section of the. Discord, if you want to check that out, or. No. This is me saying. A giant oh here we go. Water down avocado. Pause the Music City near me. Man watered down avocado. And I see it, what do you think of the new paper Mario talk to Maine? I decide to abort the area. Are you scared of France? What's happening here? OK, bye. Boot. What is happening? Be killing a spider. Yeah. Yes. Then there is a huge spider. That was a huge spider. I've never seen a spider in this apartment before and that was like it. Wolf I just watched your terrified yeah. I have to watch the replay. Oh God. So that was last night because of it. I had not nightmares, but there are a lot of bugs in my dream last night, like a lot, just. It was a long time ago. History wanted to pull on Warrior Mode. You got it. What is going on here and kind of making sure there's certain? Landmarks that I hit. Also, listening to art list audio. So I'm still kind of figuring out the best. Songs to kind of play on here, so bear with me as we figure out a play list, but I just became a member yesterday. I'm excited about it just because I've got hit with. GMC strikes on Twitch and I and screaming five days a week now exciting and wild to think about and might as well go with the investment. So just make sure that I never get in trouble. Set. Hey Mouse going on welcome to the stream you Rang out earlier. An rituals, aren't you? Did you see him? This is also for you. Interested to see how well this is gonna turn out just because I'm so fast. Like I said, I don't have too much time. So how about that? No, I guess it goes out with his nostril. That's actually pretty good to know. So let's do. Yes. His face is on even for whatever reason. I think it's the angle that it's. Just focused at maybe. Search road changes to a darker color so you can actually see what's happening because I can see it, but. Dark Blue Road Black. But yeah, what time is it where you are now? Sleeping, I slept since we last spoke. I have had a full nights rest. I'm assuming you have not gone to bed. So I think you were saying Good morning last night when. It was, I mean, technically. I guess it was morning where I am, but. Besides the point. Five, I think you were going for. This is why not worth. Center is I kind of. This is line up with kind of the center design. Not really. To top it is I always with the eyes of Toot too high an accident. It's my thing. I just love to put up really tall eyes for whatever reason. Send Almost 7:00 PM now I haven't slept since then. Yeah, exactly. So we just live our lives on different different sizes. This rose back this 99 you conferences tomorrow. Very excited to be in it. It's 1:00 PM here. Thanksgiving morning to everyone, no matter how the time of day is here, I sound like a vampire most of the time, but I guess the people nine more hours so I can. Yeah man, it's important that sleep. Now that I freelance again, so much more sleep than I ever used to. Just 'cause I can work weird hours and still get a reasonable amount. Where previously I just would stay awake during the same hours that I do now, but I would have to get up at like 8:00 o'clock in the morning. Never again. Never again. Thinking about him and stressing out a bit, that's fine. Everything. The presentation to give at the end of this. And of his life stream. Old Google Sheets about it and everything. So exciting good, you know, but. Wild Been awhile since I've had to present anything. I'm sure it'll be good. I'm sure it'll build great. Good one. Now the size of his eye. And we have lines up with the edge of his. Nose but not particularly, and then the side here. Goes to the end of kind of vision loss fashion area. Getting better at raising how tiny eyes are. So there's that at least. It's again kind of lines up with the eye, but not so much. Listening is a lot more white space on this side then this side. You doing. Same with this. Because our eyes have less white for whatever reason. The top of that now it is, Yep. Now these evenly spaced for the most part. We have to bring it in about. Appreciation about it is about new features for. The hands lifestreaming as we had a bunch of the streamers take a little survey that I sent out to them about features that they wanted and going to kind of just be going over the. Priority of different ones and which ones are popular and which ones which I thought were going to be popular or not popular. And then it kind of just helping plan for the next quarter 'cause Adobe has weird quarters or being recorders where. Technically, like the corners like over now. Or at the end of the month, even though it's not your traditional quarter. So. Like the Song. We're going to roll with it and you got time to pick you today. Like this God visible. That way we can reference again. Scene. So it is natural cigarette here, right, yeah? Palmer is now down here though. Sleep is overrated, like four to five hours. It's not for me. I wish I wish I know what I like can get, but I get all sorts of crazy really quickly. But in design so I'm kind of good, but my hands were with him so hard, just like a transformer. He does it again. Transform workers, deal with stuff right now. But he was in Fantastic Four. Basic for Human Torch. Charge. Yeah. Which is not very. Transformer E but close and I think he's also. Kid who lives in the wire. If I remember right. Known as I said, it's actually took a class on the wire, which is weird. It was actually one of my hardest classes. And. I remember the time that Fantastic Four came out. I could've sworn I made the connection between this sale. Yes, I could be just making things up right now. So this definitely like that which we do not have present. Is drawn. Let's start happening right about here. Oh my God. Open Chris Evans work. Yes, actually he was. Michael B Jordan Oh no, but Chris Evans was the Human Torch. In the first one, they had to decently bad versions of Fantastic Four. Michael B. Jordan's in the second one I think. So believe it or not, they mostly 2 movies and they didn't like either of them. Like Right? Z, which helps fight, but in the hand. So he is more of A. Top. Noggin that I'm giving him. Caroline. Good Christmas song. Yeah yeah I want to Jingle Bells right now. What are you doing man? There's either of them. Person seems to administer the last one they made. They were trying to get bike. Who created with their number? Right now it's just like yeah, hey easy W thank you so much for following. Really appreciate it too extreme every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday here. This. This helps a lot of times 'cause then you can kind of see what is different between. Saying that his head is very angled. To the side here. So I've given him a weird indent where we had in his not do. So hopefully actually do his ear for what it is rather than just like a circle. Hey Jaclyn, thank you so much for following as well. I really appreciate it. Thanks for tuning in and hanging out. Darker upper lip in a really light lower lip. So he always make the nostrils too far apart. And then that subsequently ruins all my other metric measurements. That's gone here. So thank you as well wow. You guys are doing great with all the follow. They really do appreciate. Thumbs up for it. Why is Christmas keep happening? 3D playlist I'm not feeling as good about this one, but it's OK. You know? Highlight right there. The lip lines are pretty intense still. His lines around his lips really are not that crazy. This jawline, however. Wave curvier. The center of it. This is where it should meet neck. Going to come over and go down. Like this area over fear isn't accurate. Feels a little. Burdensome. Makes me realize that I really need to get a haircut. Maybe it's a Russian Christmas pot that made the playlist probably. Anything on the Internet is now just a rough invited rolls. Sorry about that, I didn't hear anything. That was perfect timing. Is perfect timing terrifying? It was because I accidentally hit the key for it, but still. Fed home watch Ryan slides and watch out for the virus, yes. Play frosty. Alright guys, I think I have to call it. I don't like necessarily where it has landed. Which is OK. 'cause like I said, this is a faster 14 shore. About time French but. This was 30 minutes, almost exactly. I gotta do some stuff before this meeting. So if you're doing it for the first time, please now that they normally have longer than this. But Fortunately, we do not have enough time. Otherwise, make sure you check out. A comically posting later today on Instagram and Twitter and what have you? I'm going to pull it up again one more time with Bob Ross comic. I'm excited, I think it's pretty funny. I don't know when I'll be able to post it 'cause I just have a lot going on in the next like 3 hours. Mostly found in time. Who knows for not following. Nothing suspicious on Instagram work, Twitter already or read it. We should check that out.

Now if you have if you have a stylus pen with an eraser I would suggest going into your pen settings at least for walkom you can. You can get program specific an you can. Basically set these all of these buttons to do different things. So if flipping your pen erasing it doesn't work automatically first. If you have the eraser, awesome 'cause I know some some tablet systems don't have it like XP pen doesn't have the eraser and I don't believe that Dell version of the Centriq has the eraser on theirs either. So what I would do first is confirm that you have that functionality independent if you do. Go into your pen driver or pen settings and see if you can set that specific button to have the eraser functionality to. It might automatically did it, so you might have to manually go in and work on those settings. And I'm not familiar with anything other than welcome and their driver systems, so if it's something else, I won't be able to help you much there. But generally you can go in, and especially if you have a bunch of buttons here, odds are you'll have the ability to switch functionality on those. Yeah huion tablet. OK I am not familiar with have a Huey on works, nor there, um, their driver system and their settings. But let me give you an example, at least save here and show you my welcome settings. Let me see where is my pen. No no no. I don't want to do that. I want to do pen settings alright, so for example. Oh, you don't have that option, OK? Well anyway if you. If you get into the thing, if I guess if you don't have that option then you don't. You don't have that option, but if you upgrade in the future or change your stuff over in the future and you look in your tablet and pen properties, you can come here and. You can set your applications and all of your different. See, here's my eraser settings right here. And this is what you can set it as their. So depending on your system will be the ability you can do that or not. Her dad. How are you? Welcome to the stream. I am just about to shut down for the day and let me go over what I did so. I got the 18 emote sketched out. I got through this many of the final line arts, so I'm happy with this. I think I was able to get these done in one stream, but I think that's because this character is incredibly easy and quick to draw, so this part took a little longer, but I'm really happy I took the time to do these. He's such a cute, fun little character and I love drawing him so I just have the love that app squee, the one with the shades, and then the shock emote left, and so I'll get those done tonight and post. Probably this set is my daily. You can see my rough sketches here. I go through and do the rough sketch than I do line aren't going to do the color and then from there I take those items. You can see the same thing here. Here's my rough sketch. Lineart and color finished and then not only using them like on Jiffy for Instagram stickers and stuff like that.

What's new? What's happening? What's going on? Heidi what's up? Yeah so. Welcome to the stream. I'm Shawna Lynn. I'm at lettering artist and illustrator in Chicago tonight. We're just going to do some very chill sketching. I did the other day. I'm going to. I think I'm going to render them out first, and then I might do a couple more. Depending, but I'm going for about 2 hours tonight so. We'll see how this goes. Up Yeah, so if you guys are. Get excited. We're going to have fun. It's going to be nice, chill. Chill stream. So. Yeah, let's go. Yeah, I did these. Miss that failure to multiplication sketch I imported. Um? I did it the other day 'cause I'm making some stickers. So. An idea for this on the stream the other day on Friday when I was drawing a bunch of mushrooms. I thought I need to render these suckers out so I did. And then in the process of rendering them out, it came up. This was the one I had the idea for on the stream, but then I came up with the idea for this one. I love my little honey bee. I would. Watching Anna Davis courts stream. While I was doing me so it was a fun little session. Hi Andrea, how are you? Welcome to the stream. I'm not sure if I might. Bump the color up and make it a little more. Alohomora library Also. And look at Kyle's brushes. No, not kind of M GS brushes and see if there's one that's going to give me the look I'm going for. I'm going to close them out. Basic ones. Here we go. Kyle is trying media and wash it. What I'm looking for, I think. No, I still prefer my my story book color brush, so we're just going to go with that and I'm going to use a lighter hand with it. Also got bird sounds playing, so if anyone wants to listen to their own music they can afford to queue up my own so I could listen while we were. The going here. So you shouldn't be able to hear my music. You should only be hearing bird sounds. I'm not saying things like it's almost too muted, and I think I need to make it. Make a hair braider Go with that. Let's see how that works. So for that I just did a layer adjustment I. You can either right click and choose. Or is it funding opposite blending options? Yeah, blending options or I just double click the layer and it brings up the layer styles and I changed it using the color option in there. So if you guys are curious what I'm listening to, I gotta update the description 'cause I am actually not listening to the playlist, but I've got in there. That's what you want and try to find the common denominator among all of 'em and for that. For me it was texture and so I've been working to pull in texture. But now I'm trying to pull in more paint like more of a painterly style. And that I have not figured out yet. That isn't like I can see like this jam piece evolving and going further eventually, but like I have to figure out what that looks like in my hand. So in the mean time. In the mean time, I'm going to be. Too dark. But in the process tempted, I'm trying to set aside time to like take classes on SBS learn which is these school of visuals. Dirtys Maybe? Or the school of visual storytelling. That's what it is. So I'm trying to like set aside time to do that, I just haven't really done that yet. I need to. It's just getting over the intimidation factor of knowing that like it's going to be hard to do, it can be hard to learn. Then like put myself into a vulnerable state, but. Lots of your watching the beginning of stream will notice my voice, just that. Hire an. It's 'cause my voice is started. I'm like trying to get it to warm up and I can't talk in my chest. It's like if I try to talk my chest it hurts too much. And it's too exhausting. So like I'm trying to talk higher. But I feel like I sound like I'm talking with helium balloon. Because that, like Emma Stone, Gravel is still there. But I'm also like Hawaii. So where is the autos? I'm trying to talk a little more, but I'm not sure I have like this is a letter. She one of those days teddy will coming up bright and early this morning 'cause he had to. He was panicking 'cause he doesn't poop. And then he panicked again and he had to throw up. So I mean, that was my morning I he started. He started hurricane at the at the door. Once we got that, we got back into bed. And he started. He gets he shivers when he gets released when he gets sick and he doesn't know what to do. Research, shivering. So I picked him up and took him to the door. Put him down. He started her King and if anyone has has a dog or a cat you know that noise. You know that noise where you're like? Oh no I gotta take care of this. I didn't want to do it right on the floor, so like I opened the door and I shoved him out just him outside and he puked on the back porch so. Couple hours later, he finally felt much better, so I don't know what happened, but I think he realized he had to go to the bathroom and then he panicked. And then he over panic, and he made himself so he got so nervous that he made himself sick. Yeah, we've all been there. Also, I have birds playing, but if he hit the info tab you'll be able to see the playlist I'm listening to. It's the pure moods soundtrack. And if anyone was a child of the 90s, you know what the pure moods soundtrack is. And I currently have Yanni Nightingale playing. Yanni is one of. Two artists that if they are in town, I will always, always, always go see perform. Basically it's Yanni and Josh Groban. Those are my. Those are my 2 like if Yanni's in town or of Josh Groban's in town. I see both. I see them perform. I got very lucky that I got to see. Generally I only see Josh Groban perform once on a tour when he tours and that's if he makes it to my area like I don't. I don't travel more than about four hours for the concert in the most of Travel Distichs and it was an overnight trip. And that was when he was performing in Atlanta and not coming to Florida. And so. Otherwise, he's been within like about a 2 hour drive of where I live and. When I first knew I was moving up to Chicago, I saw that he was going to be performing at the United Center here. Four days after I arrived, and so I told my mom and I like, can we get tickets? Can we go and and so we did and we her friend who just moved away unfortunately, but her friend. That she's known. Longer than cheese? Add me so they're like they're like a 40 year friendship or something. Found out that we were going and she's like I love Josh Groban and goes if you can get a ticket you wanted up sitting with us but like come with us we can go get food and stuff beforehand and I was really excited 'cause I never met this friend. She would like shock my mom. She was like I thought you, I could've sworn you had met her. I was like no, you always want to Walker Brothers Pancake House and left us at grandmas Ann. When we were up here and. So we ended up. I think it needs to be a little more. I don't know that we do a little more yellow, yeah? Miss so we went the three of us to his concert and we just had a really great time. All these years we had no idea that she was a huge fan, otherwise we would have had her come join us often. But then we got really lucky 'cause you're watching. He was. They were playing one of his concerts on PBS. And they mentioned he was coming to this theater called Ravinia. Which is like within 45 minutes of where I live. And it's a big outdoor theater like it costs a lot of money to sit in the main seats. But like the lawn seats like $45.00. Which for a concert is incredible and. So he texted her and we're like we will get tickets when it goes live. If you want to go to this with us and she was like, yes, let's do it so we she's like we can have wine and snacks. and I was like that sounds like the perfect event. So we got to see him six months later, all together again. And we went on a drove to Ravinia. All of us. We parked we parked her car at my aunt and uncles house and then we drove in my car down to Ravinia. And. Manage to get lawn seats. It was in June is about this time last year. And. It got cold that night. If it's crazy, exist like it gets cold here still in June. But we were fairly close and they have like speakers all around and were like they had TV's so you could see him and we were still in. We're still a day Josh Groban concert and we had wine and cheese and charcuterie, Jerry. It was great. We were classy ladies. The answer Josh Groban Inyoni. Those are like those are my 2. When I lived in Jacksonville, FL, I went to concerts pretty. Like kind of frequently 'cause I had friends. I really like going to concerts and invite me along. So I got to see Gym Class Heroes. Red jumpsuit apparatus Fall Out Boy. Who else did I go too? When I saw follow-up no, I went to one race. All this group I think I'm going to a friends concert or something. Who is opening for like the main band But. There is a group called color slide that was really good. I don't think they're a band anymore, but. I went to a lot of concerts in college and then I really haven't. Since I've gone to like musicals and stuff more now as an adult. And then yawning. And Josh Groban. Clipping mask. What color should the label be? What do you guys think like? What color should I make the label? It should also be this blue. Let's see how that do we hate that. That I. Love Yanni concert and years ago we went to them and there is this one of the vocalists was Michelle Amato and. She has. She has a beautiful voice. And I went off to college. I originally was studying voice and which, like you would build tell by listening to me talk now because. I don't sound like I was someone that say I instead. Currently I feel like I sound like someone that's over 20 years because it's like graph leanness. But I remember looking at the teaching roster. And I came across the name Michelle Amado and so I asked my voice seizure. I said is that this same Michelle Romano that Tord with Yani and she was? Yeah it is. and I happened to see her at one of the weekly like rehearsal concert things that we had to go attend and that I had managed to never sing at. And. I went out. Her friends are like Oh my God Michelle Monicas you wanna meet up like yes I do. Like I saw you singing concert like two years ago, you're fantastic and I when I got out of the building it called my dad up like you're not going to believe who I just met. Who teaches here it goes. who I go? Michelle Amato and he goes. No way. This is like a real small world thing. I have all the stickers that I buy. I put them in the fronts and backs of my own sketchbooks. I see if my schedule is easily accessible. I have one that's completely full, but this one is. In progress. Like that like I did this one, this one. This one is mine. Bite me Nosferatu. Yeah, and then this is a clear sticker. The Little Snow Globe is by Katy Daisy. And then another Katie Daisy and will start up on here. I've got one by her username is thanks Sue. I've got stubble and about one who I don't know. It's by I've got a Sid Wyler and I have a vitch craft, another step Feelin it was often in this have a nice day and then another said another stuffy. But so, like I don't feel that covers with my notebooks because I like how the cover looks and it's pretty in this. Once the cameras in the field mice and I would hate for the speaker stateroom, but when I do on the inside it makes me happy. So in eventually, like I'll probably just like stick them. Then the pages 'cause I have like uses for sketching 1/2 use it for journaling like I've got cheese stickers in here. This came from a cheese that was really good now and remember it, but I also really liked the design. I think it was just really nice. Sorry everything is reflected weird so Staffords. I used to paint my sketchbook covers and I was like I never like How do I paint long enough to use it so. Another cheese sticker. So I end up like I would rather just get a plane cover or something like this where is just kind of looks nice. And go from there. Plug these pages there. There you can't see it. I don't think there gold edge. There there gold gilded edges, or from Chronicle books. And it said Stop grids productivity notebook. But like I like, the size is perfect for travel. It took me over a year to fill one out, but actually stuck with it til I filled the whole thing up and then I realized that they might not keep producing them. So I bought a second one like months before I finish to be safe. Yeah, it was from. I. Charcuterie and wine. Kit that my sister got me for Christmas. She got me a three month subscription. And. That was the cheese that they would send with this Plymouth cheese. It was quite good. I'm gonna drop this down. I'm going to end up tracing over this. Started watching the cow art sketchbook portfolios on YouTube and got super inspired. Still haven't filled one though LOL. I like to be paper company sketchbooks, but it's hard to find them. I've not heard of that one. I have one other that's over in my bookshelf that a black version of the sketch book that I have there, 'cause I found the original one at Barnes and Noble. And then I tried to there's one that's called. Archer and olive. And I thought it was going to be like the perfect dupe for this. And when I got it like that. The notebook itself is really nice, but like the paper the dot grid was like the Doc written. This one is such that like it doesn't vibrate when I look at it, the one in the Archer in olive vibrates. When I look at it, and I realized I wasn't going to draw on it 'cause it's going to give me a headache to stare at it. So I. Drew in it like 3 times and I abandoned it. Which stocks was like? I think I've put some stickers in there that I really like, so I'm going to source them again. You're a stickler for filling pages of, you know someone, right? Yep, that's not really like this Chronicle books. One is because. It's like the pages are nice and thick. But there not like music. Can I draw with ballpoint pen? I don't really use pencil all that much. So. Hold on, I'm going to see if I can find it for you guys. Um? But I really like it because it it's there just heavy enough, but they're also not over like too much. Here we go, it's the shine bright. Productivity Journal by Chronicle books. And there's different ones. I'm just not sure that the others are available currently, but the one I linked is the first one that I got. Hum. The Shine Brights. Oh yeah, here we go. There are two. Currently, I think they'd come out with, Uh, Oh, they've got three colors total. OK, so there's not a block of cream in a gold and I'm going to copy the link and send it. Um? Yeah, they've got black. Black, cream and gold, and it's I don't like the gold one. It looks like it's almost 2 yellow on the front, so I don't care for that. Cover, but I like the white and I like the plaque and for some reason the black one in this.", "duration": 842.7999999999929, "app": "Adobe Photoshop", "page_url": "https://www.behance.net/videos/e64b4204-4b58-44d2-86e5-1b884a0bfd44/Happy-Hour-Sketch-Time-in-Photoshop-with-Shauna-Lynn", "intents": {"using": [[24, 27], [35, 39], [41, 44], [114, 117], [146, 150], [156, 158], [180, 186], [199, 203], [206, 210], [331, 334], [349, 352], [369, 371], [376, 378], [396, 399], [413, 417], [428, 431], [439, 441], [444, 448], [471, 473], [495, 502], [517, 519], [525, 528], [563, 571], [627, 633], [680, 684], [721, 725], [795, 797], [890, 892], [897, 906], [935, 937], [1010, 1012], [1055, 1058], [1111, 1118], [1147, 1161], [1298, 1306], [1334, 1336], [1358, 1361], [1392, 1396], [1401, 1405], [1421, 1429], [1453, 1459], [1489, 1499], [1552, 1555], [1592, 1594], [1614, 1616], [1697, 1700], [1741, 1744], [1748, 1750], [1826, 1829], [1878, 1880], [1903, 1906], [1916, 1919], [1979, 1982], [2013, 2030], [2089, 2091], [2112, 2118], [2195, 2199], [2216, 2219], [2222, 2225], [2320, 2324], [2342, 2344], [2355, 2358], [2362, 2365], [2395, 2409], [2414, 2416], [2425, 2428], [2441, 2444], [2472, 2475], [2490, 2493], [2519, 2524], [2533, 2537], [2556, 2563], [2716, 2723], [2743, 2745], [2763, 2765], [2774, 2777], [2796, 2799], [2904, 2907], [2923, 2925], [2942, 2945], [2970, 2972]], "howto": []}, "ID": "22"}, {"title": "Concept art with Jeffchendesigns", "url": "http://streamprod-eastasia-streamprodeastasia-aaea.streaming.media.azure.net/291fb61f-e724-4b98-a20b-9789d573c385/output.mp4", "transcript": "Let's go a true intro. No censorship. What are you up to today? We can do some authorization challenge stuff, who's who's in chat. Let me know. Before we get started so I can wake up, let's talk to the challenge. Real quick, huh? Now the intro for anyone who is not sure what I'm doing. I'm doing this today Lightbox Expo box mystery character design challenge on artstation. I'm going to be designing 6 characters. Based on these criteria here, so I could have a leader brave joyful miss chievous serious an one creature character. And that's what we have here so far. This is the line up. In fact, you can have a look at my submission here in art station if you want to throw me that like much appreciated, but yet here I am. This is warm up to got 4 characters, can design two more today. Hopefully yo yo hey movement. Hey Oscar. And yeah, that's that's what we're going to do, so I already know what they should roughly feel like. I'm going for like a. Probably more serious type of sniper girl who's going to be tall as well, but we told them the boys 'cause why not looks better and probably one joyful character that writes this creature. You Lily. So let's get right into it, huh? Put out the sniper girl 'cause That's easier for me. I think the hardest one for me is joyful because of how I designed my characters. They don't really. You know? It's hard to make them look joyful. That is kind of right, he's like. That princey type. You guys hear the intro though. Is that a? Enjoyable. But yeah. Um? What's all these layers? These nothing layers. Yeah, don't don't really need that. Said Empty What's this? Very cool. Ah yeah, this is where I was going. I don't think I'm going to go in this direction. I'm going to make joyful. Like joyful from the mosque in my opinion. I was like one of the early sketches. Alternate creature designs. Very nice. Very nice. Chad Chen designs hell yeah. So I don't know if you guys can tell, but my eye is actually puffy this. I bring glasses, partly 'cause. So I can like bucket. But yeah, puffy I. I don't know happens like. Like a pimple grew along like this side of my eye. And made it kind of puffy. But Oh well. We still Gucci. So I already have like a sniper girl that I've done before, like a sort of ancient technology character. So I'm going to go slightly different approach and go get more coffee this time. Maybe have like a hood? I want to keep my line up there so I can refer back to this file. Yeah. Both father forgive pinkeye you think I got pink eye come on man I'm better than that. No pinkeye in this town. With my ancient tech. Folder, yeah, as always I'm going to show you guys when I'm working with full reference so you guys can get used to using it. It's not for me. So you guys remember you have to use reference. So this is my primal Tech Champions Reference Board. It's not exactly what I'm going for, but it's very useful for me. This is basically what my characters based on this kind of Aesthetic. I love this arm sold aesthetic as well and made in abyss. I think I want to get more made in abyss reference. There's like some tech in there that I want to grab. That I'm going to do right now. Probably do another time when I remember. Also has some mechanical reference so I can translate to that primal tech. Yeah, I can translate to that primal tech look. And. Also some. Sci-fi samurai reference. So right, I'm looking at this one. That's A. That's an awesome start I think I'm going to translate that to primal tech. And just a female rogue one. I don't know if I'm going to use much on here, some ideas. I think this is kind of cool. Hats cloth verse, one big Taqueria I might do that. This kind of cool, but yeah, use reference guys. It's not cheating. Doesn't make you worse artist. And if you rely on reference. Doesn't mean you're bad artists either because everyone does it. Every professional does. What kind of face is that? I do for these guys? Oh, OK, very animated for now. And who's going to draw with me today? I'm going to try complete in our work with me. I just realized I do a lot of female characters that have like some sort of gun weapon bullet fingers at another sniper girl and doing another one now. I think there's something about that aesthetic. I think it's really cool. I'm doing a bunch of thumbnails. Hell yeah, how you going with those? Are they making sense to yet? No, not really. Doing some com studies. Not nice environment type law. Just general painting com studies. Just out of the new ones, OK? Good get busy guys. Been here for a good two hours. Let's see how far you guys can get. Maybe, maybe today will play some no reference gamer who's down for that. Although I do need my time full this challenge, so we'll see how how I go, I think. Missile from Warframe. Is sick so you be judged on things for the second server time to charge of things voice. Jesus, what a morning. Actually I wonder leaving when do you sleep? I feel like you're always awake when I'm awake, and that's weird because how are you awake now? Isn't it no, no, no, make sense they awake how come you how come you're awake at like 12:00 AM for me? Is not like 2 for you. Then how then, how are you awake now as well? You sleep at 6:00 PM my time and so weird. I'll keep trying until. Until it's too late, then I'll just stop trying to make that work. Yeah, it's kind of weird. I don't even have to try any further. I think I can just tell something to work. 510 impression I also was hardly trying man. Wait till I wake up, then I'll try again. To make me do an impression of Yuli, I'll do it. Hey. Margraff said they say name right. Thanks for joining the stream. Hope you are having a great day. I think she can be shorter. Actually. I'm thinking she may be can be like. That height. Somewhere around his height, then I'll be kind of cool. The small sniper girl. It's like Baca. Just got that face. I couldn't find your food on Earth station by the artist that dope. I appreciate his Jeff Wu. They make me use My Internet man. That's an amount, and it just for Pat. And in fact, we're going to find it like just by typing here I've been. I would even used much Internet. Uh. Jeez are fine. Let's go to my like page. OK, we will find some great actually go through my like page. You'll see all the environments are like this guy is sick. Mark Young is very, very good. Allegra Hey Agara Agara is good. Zach Reds Oh, this guys really good to get as well suzhen. This is Jeff, who uses 1F Jeff. Trying to be all special and unique, but that's all we have to do. No one else will be able to tell that you're doing an impression of me. They can't differentiate us Museum accent yet. Well, the voice might be different. 'cause I think I'm a bit more high pitched and you like get it GIF. Oh hell Yeah. Cutey chief as I think you sound like. Can you call me Jeff? Oh my God Jeff. Ooh he let me down who spells Jeff like that? I'm offended as a. As one of the leading Jeffs in this world, I'm offended. As a professional, Jeff. I don't approve. Chief. How do you rate my Miley impression Oscar this time for you to rate was that? Keep it all documented. I'll try not to do anything sneaky offscreen unless it's like the deadlines is too close, and then I'll do it then. Deal. But you guys better TuneIn. Otherwise, there's no point. Promise. Do you think she looks female? Even from a distance. Then she dash move my dude man once again in the groove. I just don't feel like stopping. So like maybe some smoothing off screen might happen. You never know. Man's playing Ed. Yesterday David. I thought she moved on. I think I was tide. I think he was other things play extra good. I think I'll just play extra bad. It's one of those days, you know. I got my time down to 108 though broke that one 10 mark. The round shapes help. Also, the lips are noticeable from distance. Yeah hell yeah, I don't even need her to make someone feel female. Yeah, it feels hard to beat now though. Like one 10108 feels really really quick like sometimes I'm playing. What I think is like really fast. And it's nowhere close to 108. So that's kind of scary. Douglas sticking his bed. I don't know what that means. Oh Hey Pat, can you be my translator? But Hey, Esteban. I see you also doing gonna hell yeah, that's my plan to begin with. I'll just talk about you, add how I said you were smoothing yesterday on Tetris. Oh, what the. I'm trying to guess what estimate Esteban said. Oh, how do you speak English so you can set a shortcut for image? He let me teach you 'cause that's what I'm here for. If you go to keyboard shortcuts in go seller thing for image. Wait, is it in here it is in here right it? I think this one. You can actually set a shortcut. I have the old school way of doing it, but this is how you can set it. Flip canvas horizontally can put it as like F2 or something. I use F2 for mine as well so every time I Press F2 will just help me flip. I need to look at some sniper rifle, so I Gotta. Blue indigo She should be. Maybe this toll? So zoom in. Perfect. Look at those tiny lines. It's pretty cool lineup. What do you guys think she fitting in? Apart from like her thin lines, do you think she's doing OK in here? I think kind of works. You're going to change much of the pose. I don't think so. I'm going to go with this. They have shield boy whose massive chunk. We have a Doritos man. I'll snack of the team. Miss Chievous Lady think she might be evil possibly? Who knows? Have a creature and we have our newest addition serious sniper girl. Alrighty. Actually this one thing I want to do to make her feel more round. I just thought of it just then. What if I make this part? Round instead. The. I was originally going with something a bit more fluffy as well, but I want to do. More of a lizard because of the aesthetic of everything else. And now she feels more round. I think this is better. Who? There we go. Delete the wrong one. There we go. Delete the wrong one again. OK, not this one. Not this one. That one. Hell yeah. Just one left. We can merge all this. Move across. Hey, feel free to ask me any questions as well guys I can talk and draw. But yeah, OK, I had this idea for cheerful to use the mosque to my advantage. Might grab arm, I'll creature. Let's hide this cube on him. What's for lunch? They were going out actually going out for some Yum Cha. It's safe enough to do that now. What's for dinner? Would you like to know? I don't know. I think having decided yet we're going to so like Sunday for me to shopping day is Sunday for me. By the way, it's like 7:45 AM. That's when we go shopping and decide what we cook for the week. And we like to try to make things fair, like to two meals. Each and like we try to do big meals so we can eat lunch from the leftovers of each meal. Pretty good system. Person who cooks doesn't clean. So you do when you share house. Like is asking me about my dinner. Anyway, I said you can, but like. Go on. Give me this odd questions. This feels so wrong to do like. This kind of character in this line of just doesn't make sense. I need someone that can. Look like what makes someone looks like they're like the sort of person controlling. A creature. Maybe they just have something that's related to the creature as well. So like the horn. Plus, it looks like an evil info, something, geez. What's something you've learned from teaching in your mental ship? That's a really good question, Lee. Now that's going to use too much brain power for me to answer, so I'm going to ignore it. Now I'm getting. I think the real thing about the mentor ship is it reinforces what I know. I think when you have to explain something to someone else. It really tests your ability to. How much you really understand on that topic and it really makes you think about. Like how you want to convey it as well. Like all of that, with all that comes together, it just reinforces what you understand and then like verbalizing it. Um? Kind of helps me walk through my understanding of it. So I've learned a lot, actually. All this stuff about composition, how we approach design like what makes us successful design. I think that's very hard to nail down if you just. If you don't even think about it, but talking through it like talking about like some key elements of contrast that using character design or any type of design that helps draw focus to some areas and takes it away in areas that don't have that contrast. For stuff like that has been. Pretty helpful for me. Circus ringmaster Whip leash whistle. Yeah, I think those are pretty good stuff. I think God. Also learned that there's a lot of different circumstances that people are in, and it can really. Hindi you I feel like I was lucky in my time of learning. I didn't really have many things that help me back. But Evans management situation so different. And you can't like have the same expectation for. Everyone I feel. He runs at different paces as well. What else? I used to say. I say, like you know. And people called me towns and I was like I don't really think that's the thing like I don't really believe in talent. But teaching maybe realize that shoulder mounted be talent for art and a lot of it is from our ability to work hard. And put the time in. But There is some element of it where there's like. Some stuff does come more naturally, although it can be taught, but there's definitely something there where some people can grasp ideas quicker than others. Doesn't mean you know people should give up or anything, it just means for that aspect. It might take longer. So for example, maybe designing is a strength and someone learns it faster than you, but maybe you're better at illustration. You understand lighting and all that much better than others. I believe in that. So I ask you a question. I think it does answer your question is a very broad question. Um? Also think yeah, working hard is another topic that. I think is interesting. It's hard for some people to really. Depend on the discipline to work hard. I've noticed that as well. And I think it's something that's easily. I think that's something that some people have a really hard time breaking out of, like their habits and creating good habits. To learn. Defaulting to like the easier path, which is like. You know, I can't do it today, so I'll do it tomorrow and then they end up wasting more time when instead I think the better choice. If you're really serious about this is to really buckle down and. Except there's going to be crappy days and you just have to get through it. And hopefully another, I believe from me, reminding them every week. The remember that. 'cause I definitely going through the struggle, but. His difference, like I struggled through the hot days. But I think generally they might have more hard days with me. I'm not really sure how that works, but yeah. Again, everyone is different, right? He doesn't look very cheerful. Yeah, I think teachings are very powerful tool for. The teacher as well. There's a lot to learn, and I do recommend anyone who. Once it be more professional to get into teaching when they can. It kind of feels like I'm being an author. I feel awful times as well, like the way I approach teaching. Oi oi. Tetris layer, oh boy. I'll look you're in like it here. About 15 minutes in, which is 10 minutes away from logo times that. That way you planned Amy. I do wonder if like that experience I have with teaching can. Help out with me when it's being author after one day. Probably does. I think it's very. Very much related. You have an odd question. Throw it over. And Ed will answer you. No answer. What exactly I thinking when you're designing those head accessory horns? Um? I'm trying to break up silhouette. They made him thinking about is. This shape. How that can be different from? These shapes or how they also relate slightly. See how there's like a general sort of. Like triangular shape I'm going for for these heads her as well. Other hers kind of caps off goes like poop. I have that idea, but I don't want it to be exactly the same, so they're related in that sense that they are. Kind of triangular. Discuss more square, definitely, but. They are related. But I want it to be different enough so that's not the same. Design. And again. It's my reference that's helping me out. I'm looking at stuff in there. Call the time. So it can be consistent. I can tell you just like normal heads who wants to do normal heads. So I want this guy would be like. And it should be holding the horns. Or should he do his own thing? That's why I'm wondering. Yes, almost bobo o'clock here, right? You're right mess. I don't want him to like you guys. Like mentioned the whip and all that, but then I'm wondering if he looks so happy. He's got like a whip and this guys like depressed as hell. Does that look bad? I think it does. I think I'll just have him like excitedly holding the horns. So I'm going to make this how much bigger? And just kind of put him off screen so I can design the horns around. Designed this guy around the horns here. There we go. Perfect. Like a little new imp. Little happy hump on the back. A lot of designers, yeah, me thinking about silhouettes and how it can be different. I think anything significant that you want your viewers to see should be seen in the silhouette. So that's something to think about if you're not using that. He looked at, I think some. During the Dutch he's like half of his bed. I'll be back in 1 second. I. Wow. Alright, he's a big boy. Wolf OK, break time buddy. And chill for two minutes. What's this? What's on your little? No private parts. What is this grass? Though goes back and uh, go Cam. Here we go. Hey you guys have any bobo questions? File is here. You can answer questions buddy. Oof. OK, OK. Happy Boy, Happy Boy. You're pretty cool, guy. How long have you been? A life. Alright, you made me lie for both. OK, OK. I've been like for an hour she's looking ahead. I've been life about an hour right now and I've done 1 character sketch onto the second one at the moment, if you ask him how long bows been alive. Turning is turning 8 I think. Is Big Ben, but was really big. I bet like if logo grew up in the wild. He'd be the Alpha. And like he'd lead a pack like that. His personality and like.
